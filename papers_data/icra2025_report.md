### [Generative Fuzzy Rules from Expert Demonstration for Robust Imitation Learning]()

Imitation learning allows robots to acquire complex actions by imitating expert demonstrations, removing the need for manual control policy design or reward shaping. It has been successfully applied in manipulation, locomotion, and navigation tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on deep neural networks, which require large amounts of expert data and suffer from training instability, high computational costs, and poor interpretability. We propose a fuzzy rule-based imitation learning method that generates interpretable IF-THEN rules from expert demonstrations. Using the Mamdani product and a weighted average mechanism, actions are produced with fewer learnable parameters. This improves learning efficiency, enhances transparency, and enables dynamic adaptation to new conditions without additional expert data. The approach is validated on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator, showing robust and generalizable action generation under varied scenarios.

### [EffiDynaMix: A Novel Efficient Gaussian Mixture Model for Robot Inertia Model Learning with Dynamics-Motivated Optimal Excitation]()

In this paper, a novel and efficient non-parametric dynamics modeling method, called EffiDynaMix, is proposed. This gray-box, data-driven technique combines the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with the mathematical inertia model of robot behavior. This integration simplifies the creation of train datasets and enhances the model's generalization capabilities. Extensive testing via simulations and experiments on a robot manipulator indicates that EffiDynaMix outperforms conventional data-driven methods such as non-Optimal GMM (nonOpt-GMM), chirp trained GMM (chirp-GMM), Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) in both training efficiency and accuracy, particularly in new data scenarios. By incorporating system dynamics, EffiDynaMix not only streamlines the learning process but also ensures smooth adaptation to unfamiliar situations.

### [Nonlinear Disturbance Observer-Based Robust Control for Flapping-Wing Aerial Manipulators]()

Flapping-wing aerial manipulators offer promising capabilities for efficient and lightweight robotic applications but remain highly susceptible to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances due to their nonlinear, time-varying dynamics and low Reynolds number operation. These challenges significantly hinder their ability to perform stable manipulation tasks. Although robust control presents a viable solution, its implementation is nontrivial for flapping-wing platforms due to complex dynamics and susceptibility to uncertainties and external disturbances. This work proposes a parallel nonlinear disturbance observer-based (NDOB) robust controller targeting the altitude and longitudinal dynamics of an X-shaped flapping-wing UAV. The controller is designed to suppress undesired motion during manipulation, improving stability and disturbance rejection. Experimental results on the Flapper Nimble+ platform validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating accurate trajectory tracking and robustness under wind disturbances and varying payloads.

### [Adaptive Exafference Via eXtended Reality for Functional Movement Disorder Rehabilitation]()

Functional Movement Disorders (FMD) involve impaired voluntary motor control despite no structural neurological damage and are increasingly understood within a predictive coding framework. Disruptions in sensory attenuation and prediction error updating impair the sense of agency in FMD. We present an eXtended Reality (XR)-based biofeedback platform that integrates haptic exafference, cued motor imagery, and adaptive reinforcement to recalibrate sensorimotor control through operant conditioning. Using a Kalman filter and Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control model, we simulate disrupted internal modeling in FMD and demonstrate how motor imagery suggestions for preconditioning and haptic postconditioning can restore control by enhancing state estimation and reducing prediction error. Our co-designed platform incorporates real-time visual and force feedback, and wearable brain imaging to monitor neural correlates of agency. Usability studies and simulation results highlighted the potential of XR-based adaptive control for personalized rehabilitation in FMD, bridging computational neuroscience, robotics, and clinical neurorehabilitation.

### [From Observation to Correction: EEG-fNIRS Microstate Transitions in Surgical Skill Acquisition]()

Understanding how the brain transitions between cognitive states during complex tasks is a central challenge in neuroscience for neuroengineering. This study investigates EEG microstate dynamics during the “suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying” task—the most complex skill in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program. Using multimodal neuroimaging data (EEG and fNIRS), we examine expertise-dependent brain activation patterns through the lens of a Kalman Filter-based human motor control framework. Microstates—quasi-stable spatial EEG patterns—are mapped to functional brain networks and modeled as elements of internal state prediction, sensory feedback, and error correction. Six EEG-fNIRS microstates were extracted using K-Means clustering and aligned with canonical microstates (A–F), capturing transitions linked to salience, attention, and motor planning. Experts demonstrated efficient microstate transitions during both task initiation and error response, engaging networks like the frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks, while novices exhibited variable and reactive patterns. Kalman-based control model provided a unified framework linking neurophysiological microstates with adaptive motor control, highlighting how experience shapes cognitive and sensorimotor dynamics during skill learning.

### [Efficient 6-DoF Grasp Prediction from RGB Via Hybrid 3D Representation]()

Reliable object grasping is one of the fundamental tasks in robotics. However, determining grasping pose based on single-image input has long been a challenge due to limited visual information and the complexity of real-world objects. In this work, we propose Triplane Grasping, a fast grasping decision-making method that relies solely on a single RGB-only image as input. Triplane Grasping creates a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian 3D representation through a point decoder and a triplane decoder, which produce an efficient and high-quality reconstruction of the object to be grasped to meet real-time grasping requirements. We propose to use an end-to-end network to generate 6-DoF parallel-jaw grasp distributions directly from 3D points in the point cloud as potential grasp contacts and anchor the grasp pose in the observed data. Experiments on the OmniObject3D and GraspNet-1Billion datasets demonstrate that our method achieves rapid modeling and grasping pose decision-making for daily objects, and strong generalization capability.

### [Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Ultrasound Needle Tracking with Motion Prefix and Tunable Register]()

Ultrasound (US)-guided needle insertion is crucial for minimally invasive interventions, yet robust needle tracking remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training data. This paper introduces a data-efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) framework incorporating a motion prefix and tunable register to reduce data dependency on labeled US needle tracking dataset while maintaining accuracy. With the proposed plug-and-play motion prefix, it enables task-oriented adaptation of historical motion at minimal dependency on training data. By further incorporating the lightweight tunable register, the global context can be adapted to small US datasets without losing learned behavior from pretraining domain. Evaluations were conducted on collected datasets with motorized and manual insertions using different US machines. By pretraining on large-scale open-world datasets and fine-tuning on limited US data, our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various data-insufficient or out-of-distribution scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first US needle tracker trained with DEFT, offering a practical solution for clinical deployment where labeled data is scarce.

### [Semnav: A Semantic Segmentation Driven Approach to Visual Semantic Navigation]()

Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a key problem in robotics where an agent must find a target object in an unknown environment using mostly visual cues. Most current VSN models are trained in simulated environments, often using rendered scenes that resemble the real world. These models generally rely on raw RGB images, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world scenarios due to domain adaptation issues. To address this, we propose SemNav, a novel approach that uses semantic segmentation as the main visual input. By incorporating high-level semantic information, our model enhances the agent’s perception and decision-making abilities. This allows it to learn more robust navigation policies that generalize better to unseen environments, both in simulation and in the real world.We also introduce a new dataset—the SemNav dataset—specifically designed to train navigation models that use semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method extensively in simulated environments (using Habitat 2.0 and the HM3D dataset) and with real-world robotic platforms.Experiments show that SemNav outperforms current state-of-the-art VSN methods, achieving higher success rates. Additionally, our real-world tests confirm that semantic segmentation significantly helps bridge the sim-to-real gap, making our method a strong candidate for practical VSN applications. We will release the dataset, code, and trained models to the public.

### [Gait Optimization for Underwater Legged Robots Using Data-Driven Hydrodynamic Modeling and Reinforcement Learning]()

Precise close-contact inspections are critical in underwater environments, where complex dynamics and biofouling pose significant challenges to traditional vehicles. To address these issues, this study develops a Reinforcement Learning-based framework to optimize the gait of an underwater legged robot for accurate and stable locomotion. The simulation environment integrates hydrodynamic forces, buoyancy effects, added mass, and seabed interactions to train robust gait control policies. By designing the action space to regulate phase and amplitude differences within a legged oscillation model, the framework ensures predictable gait patterns. Experimental validation was conducted both in simulation and on a real robot, confirming that the RL-trained policy effectively mitigates hydrodynamic disturbances. The results demonstrated reduced altitude and pitch instability during fast forward walking, as well as improved heading accuracy in curved trajectories.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Planning Using Deep Ensembles and Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Social Navigation]()

Human motion is stochastic and ensuring safe robot navigation in a pedestrian-rich environment requires proactive decision-making. Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor.

### [Visual Explanation of DRL-Based Mobile Robot Via Augmented Reality]()

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the methods used to achieve autonomous mobility in robots. Although it effectively achieves high performance, there is still a problem that the decision-making process of robot actions is unclear. To address this, many studies have been conducted to enable visual analysis through images. However, these images lack a direct connection to physical space, which limits user understanding of robot actions. Therefore, we present an encoder-decoder model based on Transformer that enables a visual explanation of DRL-based robot autonomous movement and projects it onto physical space using augmented reality(AR). In this paper, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a direct visual explanation for different robot actions and that the visualization using AR effectively enhances users’ understanding of robot actions.

### [Hysteresis-Assisted Shape Morphing for Soft Continuum Robots]()

Conventional robot actuation often relies on more actuators for greater dexterity, complicating design and control. While soft robots with passive under-actuation or multi-stable metamaterials simplify actuation, they rely on external forces or limited multi-stable structures. Here, we introduce a Hysteresis-Assisted Shape-Morphing (HasMorph) paradigm for soft continuum robots and integrate it with tip-everting soft-growing robots (SGRs) to enable scalable shape-morphing in confined spaces. HasMorph exploits shape hysteresis—differences in configuration during loading and unloading—to achieve multi-section bending with minimal actuators through an Inverted Zigzag Tendon-Sheath Mechanism. By alternating just two actuators, this mechanism enables billions of stable shape changes in soft continuum robots, vastly expanding their configuration space and workspace without added hardware complexity. By leveraging friction-induced hysteresis, the SGRs can reversibly morph its shape while maintaining frictionless tip growth. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate reversible shape morphing, tip steering, and follow-the-leader tip growth in unstructured spaces. These findings underscore the potential of hysteresis-assisted actuation for dexterous manipulation and navigation of soft continuum robots, paving the way for advanced applications in medical intervention, industrial inspection, and exploration.

### [Four Principles for Physically Interpretable World Models]()

As autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in open and uncertain settings, there is a growing need for trustworthy world models that can reliably predict future high-dimensional observations. The learned latent representations in world models lack direct mapping to meaningful physical quantities and dynamics, limiting their utility and interpretability in downstream planning, control, and safety verification. In this paper, we argue for a fundamental shift from physically informed to physically interpretable world models --- and crystallize four principles that leverage symbolic knowledge to achieve these ends: (1) structuring latent spaces according to the physical intent of variables, (2) learning aligned invariant and equivariant representations of the physical world, (3) adapting training to the varied granularity of supervision signals, and (4) partitioning generative outputs to support scalability and verifiability. We experimentally demonstrate the value of each principle on two benchmarks. This paper opens several intriguing research directions to achieve and capitalize on full physical interpretability in world models.

### [Improving Camera-LiDAR BEV Fusion for Long-Range 3D Object Detection Via Accurate Depth Projection and Feature Balancing]()

This paper proposes a Bird’s Eye View (BEV)- based camera-LiDAR fusion algorithm to enhance long-range 3D object detection by leveraging LiDAR-to-image depth projection and voxel-wise average pooling. Accurate detection of distant objects is essential for autonomous driving safety, yet existing BEV-based fusion methods suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and imbalanced feature intensities. To address these limitations, the proposed method leverages accurate depth maps generated by projecting LiDAR points onto images for accurate geometric transformations of camera features into 3D space, and employs voxel-wise average pooling to balance feature intensities across distances, producing consistent BEV representations. Evaluations on the nuScenes dataset, using a distance-scaled linear matching threshold, demonstrate significant improvements, notably a 49.2% of mean average precision increase for objects beyond 60 m.

### [A High-Torque-Density Robotic Wrist with Embedded Torque Sensing for Peg-In-Hole Tasks]()

This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a torque-controlled robotic wrist with high torque density. The proposed wrist features a serial pitch-yaw joint configuration that enhances dexterity while maintaining compactness. The design integrates stepper motors, harmonic geartrains, and compliant mechanisms to optimize torque output and control accuracy. A compliant pulley and a compliant cap are introduced, enabling embedded torque sensing without the need for external sensors, thereby reducing system complexity and improving response time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the wrist in torque accuracy, backdrivability, impedance regulation, and misalignment correction during peg-in-hole assembly, highlighting the benefits of the compliant-driven torque sensing approach. Compared to existing robotic wrists, the proposed design achieves a higher torque density. The findings contribute to advancing robotic wrist technology, particularly in applications requiring precise force modulation, high dexterity, and adaptable compliance.

### [Robot Particle Herding: Fundamental Concepts and Experiments]()

In this paper, we address the problem of manipulating multi-particle aggregates using a bimanual robotic system. Our approach enables the autonomous transport of dispersed particles through a series of shaping and pushing actions using robotically-controlled tools. Achieving this advanced manipulation capability presents two key challenges: high-level task planning and trajectory execution. For task planning, we leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable primitive actions such as tool affordance grasping and non-prehensile particle pushing. For trajectory execution, we represent the evolving particle aggregate's contour using truncated Fourier series, providing efficient parametrization of its closed shape. We adaptively compute trajectory waypoints based on group cohesion and the geometric centroid of the aggregate, accounting for its spatial distribution and collective motion. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in actively shaping and manipulating multi-particle aggregates while maintaining high system cohesion.

### [The Shape Awakens: Estimating Dynamic Soft Robot States from the Outer Rim]()

State estimation for soft continuum robots is challenging due to their infinite-dimensional states (poses, strains, velocities) resulting from continuous deformability, while conventional sensors provide only discrete data. A recent method, called a boundary observer, uses Cosserat rod theory to estimate all robot states by measuring only tip velocity. In this work, we propose a novel boundary observer that instead measures the internal wrench at the robot’s base, leveraging the duality between velocity and internal wrench. Both observers are inspired by energy dissipation, but the base-based approach offers a key advantage: it uses only a 6-axis force/torque sensor at the base, avoiding the need for external sensing systems. Combining tip- and base-based methods further enhances energy dissipation, speeds up convergence, and improves estimation accuracy. We validate the proposed algorithms in experiments where all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3 seconds, even with large initial deviations, and they recover from unknown disturbances while effectively tracking high-frequency vibrations.

### [Good Deep Feature to Track: Self-Supervised Feature Extraction and Tracking in Visual Odometry]()

Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task-specific loss function design. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

### [Uncertainty Aware Ankle Exoskeleton Control]()

Current exoskeleton controllers are constrained to predefined, cyclic tasks (e.g., flat-ground walking) and struggle to adapt to the variability of real-world environments, with only 4% of rehabilitation studies validated in home/community settings. This limitation poses safety risks, as preprogrammed torque profiles may fail during novel movements. We propose a deep learning-based framework to enable task-agnostic control, a high level uncertainty classifier-based controller. The classifier detects whether user actions align with "in-distribution" trained tasks (walking, jogging on inclines/declines) or represent novel "out-of-distribution" scenarios, switching between task-specific assistance and safety-optimized torque. Leveraging biomechanical time-series data from the Dephy Exoboot, three temporal convolutional network (TCN) based architectures—ensembles, autoencoders, and GANs—were trained on actuated/unactuated locomotion data. Evaluated offline on a test set (N=3 users) containing trained tasks (treadmill/overground walking/jogging) and novel actions (stairs, jumping, sitting), the model achieved an F1-score of 0.99 and a J-statistic of 0.985. Results demonstrated clear separation between in-distribution (assisted) and out-of-distribution (safety mode) tasks, even during dynamic transitions. Future work will validate the system in online, continuous environments outside the lab, advancing toward deployable exoskeletons for diverse daily activities.

### [Monocular Vision-Based Autonomous Docking Considering Estimation and Motion Capabilities]()

Autonomous docking is a crucial capability for achieving long-term and ultimate autonomy in unmanned vehicle operations. Monocular cameras can be considered as one of the most efficient and promising sensing options for autonomous docking because many existing unmanned vehicles have at least one onboard camera for teleoperation or monitoring. However, monocular cameras possess a fundamental limitation as a stand-alone position-sensing device in the state estimation for autonomous docking due to their nature of bearings-only sensing and the lack of range observability. This study proposes an autonomous docking method for nonholonomic vehicles using monocular vision-based bearing-only measurements. The proposed approach computes the control inputs that enable docking while drawing trajectories that simultaneously consider the vehicle’s motion constraints and state observability. Simulation results are shown to validate the proposed method under vehicle docking scenarios with a single-point landmark for the dock and bearing-only sensing.

### [An Underactuated Mechanism Enabling Two-DOF Thumb Motion with a Single Actuator]()

Structural lightness and functional versatility are key requirements in robotic prosthetic hands. To achieve both characteristics, this study proposes a novel underactuated thumb mechanism that enables independent 2-DOF motion using a single actuator. The design employs the Geneva mechanism’s intermittent motion to control ab/adduction, while its non-engaged range of motion drives flexion/extension via a wire pulley system. A shape-adaptive grasp mechanism is also implemented to enable both power and pinch grips. The mechanism achieves independent motion on different planes with minimal components. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively realizes 2-DOF thumb motion using only one actuator, offering a compact and modular solution for next-generation prosthetic hands.

### [Proactive Vortex Ring State Management for High Speed Descent UAVs in Mountain Rescue: Vibration Modeling and SVM Based Detection]()

In mountain rescue operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must repeatedly ascend and descend. However, most UAVs face limitations on their vertical descent speed. Exceeding this limit can trigger a dangerous airflow condition known as the vortex ring state (VRS). The VRS causes the UAV to lack rotor speed response and increases fuselage vibration, making it uncontrollable. Howeverpilots or operators cannot perceive the onset of VRS, the timing of exiting the VRS is critical yet challenging. To address these issues, we propose a strategy allowing UAVs to maintain controlled descent within the VRS or recover to a hover state. We developed a VRS vibration model by analyzing the relationship between descent rate, rotor speed, and vibration to calculate the vibration under VRS.Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to confirm VRS flowfield and validate the vibration model. Then we take the realflight tests, we descended the UAV at 10 m/s, recording the descent rate and vibration amplitude with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We assume the high-speed descent UAV can detect and respond to VRS and apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to analyze vibration signal changes, distinguishing VRS characteristics from those observed during hover and climb phases in real-flight data. With this approach verified, we further tested high-speed descents at 12 m/s and 15 m/s. This study reveals the function between VRS vibration, rotor speed,

### [Real-Time Robot Base Placement Based on 3D Inverse Reachability Map]()

Optimal base placement is a critical problem in mobile manipulation, as the position of the mobile base directly influences task feasibility and manipulability. In this work, we propose a real-time base placement method using a 3D Inverse Reachability Map (IRM). By slicing the 3D IRM into 2D layers and leveraging manipulability-based metrics, our method efficiently identifies optimal base poses and trajectories for multiple task goals. The proposed approach supports dynamic task scenarios and outperforms prior methods in computation time. Experimental results using a 7-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for both static task poses and continuous end-effector trajectories.

### [Hierarchical Robotic Intelligence Via LLM and RL]()

Achieving robust robotic intelligence for real-world tasks remains a challenge due to the need for precise control and contextual adaptability. This work introduces an integrative AI framework that synergizes GPT-4’s contextual reasoning with reinforcement learning (RL) for enhanced task planning and object manipulation. Using Hello Robot’s Stretch 2, our approach interprets natural language instructions, generates strategic plans, and executes actions in dynamic environments. Experiments across static, dynamic, and complex scenarios demonstrate superior performance, with success rates of 90%, 85%, and 80%, respectively, outperforming standalone RL, GPT-4, and state-of-the-art methods like TidyBot (85%) and OK-Robot (75%). Our framework bridges high-level reasoning and low-level control, reducing completion times and retries, and paves the way for more autonomous, efficient robotic systems.

### [Robotic Assistant for Image-Guided Treatment of Ankle Joint Dislocations]()

Trauma to the ankle is a common injury and a major source of long-term disability. Each year, over half a million ankle injuries require surgical intervention. In cases involving syndesmotic sprains, surgical manipulation of the tibia and fibula is necessary to properly align and reduce the syndesmosis space. However, current manual reduction techniques—whether open or percutaneous—often result in inaccurate reduction. We propose a novel system that integrates intraoperative low-dose cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with 3D-2D image registration and robotic manipulation of the fibula to precisely restore its anatomical alignment with the tibial incisura, while minimizing radiation exposure to both patients and surgical staff. This study reports on the development of the robotic assistant and the accompanying image-based 3D planning and guidance method. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the robotic system and the accuracy of the multi-body 3D-2D registration. The results demonstrate that the robotic system can achieve the required motion with a free-space positioning accuracy of 0.26 ± 0.10 mm. The 3D-2D registration method achieved high accuracy of 0.2 ± 0.8 mm, enabling tracking of the robot and bones to dynamically correct the trajectory during the procedure.

### [Achieving Human Level Competitive Robot Table Tennis]()

Achieving human-level performance on real world tasks is a north star for the robotics community. We present the first learned robot agent that reaches amateur human-level performance in competitive table tennis. Table tennis is a physically demanding sport that takes humans years to master. We contribute (1) a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of (i) low level controllers with their skill descriptors that model their capabilities and (ii) a high level controller that chooses the low level skills, (2) techniques for enabling zero-shot sim-to-real and curriculum building, including an iterative approach (train in sim, deploy in real), and (3) real time adaptation to unseen opponents. Policy performance was assessed through 29 robot vs. human matches of which the robot won 45% (13/29). All humans were unseen players and their skill level varied from beginner to tournament level. Whilst the robot lost all matches vs. the most advanced players it won 100% matches vs. beginners and 55% matches vs. intermediate players, demonstrating solidly amateur human-level performance.

### [Robo-DM: Data Management for Large Robot Datasets]()

Recent work suggests that very large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations can train transformer-based models that have the potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating, distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM reduces the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and data load time during training. In particular, compared to the RLDS format used in OXE datasets, Robo-DM’s compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x (lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster. In fine-tuning Octo, a transformer-based robot policy with 73k episodes with RT-1 data, Robo-DM does not incur any loss in training performance. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer. Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer any reduction in downstream task accuracy. Code and evaluation scripts can be found on the website.

### [No Plan but Everything under Control: Robustly Solving Sequential Tasks with Dynamically Composed Gradient Descent]()

We introduce a novel gradient-based approach for solving sequential tasks by dynamically adjusting the underlying myopic potential field in response to feedback and the world's regularities. This adjustment implicitly considers subgoals encoded in these regularities, enabling the solution of long sequential tasks, as demonstrated by solving the traditional planning domain of Blocks World— without any planning . Unlike conventional planning methods, our feedback-driven approach adapts to uncertain and dynamic environments, as demonstrated by one hundred real-world trials involving drawer manipulation. These experiments highlight the robustness of our method compared to planning and show how interactive perception and error recovery naturally emerge from gradient descent without explicitly implementing them. This offers a computationally efficient alternative to planning for a variety of sequential tasks, while aligning with observations on biological problem-solving strategies.

### [MiniVLN: Efficient Vision-And-Language Navigation by Progressive Knowledge Distillation]()

In recent years, Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) has advanced rapidly, yet the increasing size of models conflicts with the limited computational capabilities of Embodied AI platforms. To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.

### [PolyTouch: A Robust Multi-Modal Tactile Sensor for Contact-Rich Manipulation Using Tactile-Diffusion Policies]()

Achieving robust dexterous manipulation in unstructured domestic environments remains a significant challenge in robotics. Even with state-of-the-art robot learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions, visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales, which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and scalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multi-modal contact sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots.

### [A New Stereo Fisheye Event Camera for Fast Drone Detection and Tracking]()

In this paper, we present a new compact vision sensor consisting of two fisheye event cameras mounted back-to-back, which offers a full 360-degree view of the surrounding environment. We describe the optical design, projection model and practical calibration using the incoming stream of events, of the novel stereo camera, called SFERA. The potential of SFERA for real-time target tracking is evaluated using a Bayesian estimator adapted to the geometry of the sphere. Real-world experiments with a prototype of SFERA, including two synchronized Prophesee EVK4 cameras and a DJI Mavic Air 2 quadrotor, show the effectiveness of the proposed system for aerial surveillance.

### [Learning-Based Adaptive Navigation for Scalar Field Mapping and Feature Tracking]()

Scalar field features such as extrema, contours, and saddle points are essential for applications in environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and resource exploration. Traditional navigation methods often rely on predefined trajectories, leading to inefficient and resource-intensive mapping. This paper introduces a new adaptive navigation framework that leverages learning techniques to enhance exploration efficiency and effectiveness in scalar fields, even under noisy data and obstacles. The framework employs Partial Differential Equations to model scalar fields and a Gaussian Process Regressor to estimate the fields and their gradients, enabling real-time path adjustments and obstacle avoidance. We provide a theoretical foundation for the approach and address several limitations found in existing methods. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through simulation benchmarks and field experiments with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle, showing improved efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods and offering a robust solution for real-time environmental monitoring.

### [Measurement Simplification in Rho-POMDP with Performance Guarantees]()

Decision making under uncertainty is at the heart of any autonomous system acting with imperfect information. The cost of solving the decision making problem is exponential in the action and observation spaces, thus rendering it unfeasible for many online systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to efficient decision-making, by partitioning the high-dimensional observation space. Using the partitioned observation space, we formulate analytical bounds on the expected information- theoretic reward, for general belief distributions. These bounds are then used to plan efficiently while keeping performance guar- antees. We show that the bounds are adaptive, computationally efficient, and that they converge to the original solution. We extend the partitioning paradigm and present a hierarchy of partitioned spaces that allows greater efficiency in planning. We then propose a specific variant of these bounds for Gaussian beliefs and show a theoretical performance improvement of at least a factor of 4. Finally, we compare our novel method to other state of the art algorithms in active SLAM scenarios, in simulation and in real experiments. In both cases we show a sign

### [VSS-SLAM: Voxelized Surfel Splatting for Geometally Accurate SLAM]()

Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) helps robots estimate their poses and perceive the environment in unknown settings. Recent work has demonstrated that implicit neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer higher fidelity scene representation than traditional map representations. We propose VSS-SLAM, which utilizes voxelized surfels as the map representation for incremental mapping in unknown environments. This representation effectively addresses the issue of redundant and disordered primitives encountered in previous methods, thereby enhancing geometric accuracy during reconstruction. Specifically, our approach divides the scene using voxels and stores geometric and appearance information in feature vectors at the voxel vertices. Before rendering, these feature vectors are decoded to generate the corresponding surfels. Additionally, we align camera poses through image and depth rendering. Extensive experiments on the Replica and TUM RGBD datasets demonstrate that VSS-SLAM delivers high-fidelity reconstruction and accurate pose estimation in both simulated and real-world environments. Source code will soon be available.

### [New Graph Distance Measures and Matching of Topological Maps for Robotic Exploration]()

Comparing graph-structured maps is a task of paramount importance in robotic exploration and cartography, but unfortunately the computational cost of the existing similarity measures, such as the graph edit distance (GED), is prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we introduce and characterize three new graph distance measures which satisfy the requirements for a metric. The first one, "LogEig", computes the square root of the sum of the squared logarithms of the generalized eigenvalues of the shifted Laplacian matrices associated with the two graphs, while the second calculates the Bures distance between these positive definite matrices. The third distance, "Rank", computes the rank of the difference of the graph shift operators associated with the two graphs, e.g. the adjacency or the Laplacian matrix. Examples and numerical experiments with graphs from a publicly-available dataset, show the accuracy and computational efficiency of the new metrics for 2D topological-map matching, compared to the GED. The effect of spectral sparsification on the new graph distance measures is examined as well.

### [EnvoDat: A Large-Scale Multisensory Dataset for Robotic Spatial Awareness and Semantic Reasoning in Heterogeneous Environments]()

To ensure the efficiency of robot autonomy under diverse real-world conditions, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset is essential to benchmark the operating algorithms' performance and robustness. Current benchmarks predominantly focus on urban terrains, specifically for on-road autonomous driving, leaving multi-degraded, densely vegetated, dynamic and feature-sparse environments, such as underground tunnels, natural fields, and modern indoor spaces underrepresented. To fill this gap, we introduce EnvoDat, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset collected in diverse environments and conditions, including high illumination, fog, rain, and zero visibility at different times of the day. Overall, EnvoDat contains 26 sequences from 13 scenes, 10 sensing modalities, over 1.9TB of data, and over 89K fine-grained polygon-based annotations for more than 82 object and terrain classes. We post-processed EnvoDat in different formats that support benchmarking SLAM and supervised learning algorithms, and fine-tuning multimodal vision models. With EnvoDat, we contribute to environment-resilient robotic autonomy in areas where the conditions are extremely challenging. The datasets and other relevant resources can be accessed through https://linusnep.github.io/EnvoDat/.

### [Probabilistic Degeneracy Detection for Point-To-Plane Error Minimization]()

Degeneracies arising from uninformative geometry are known to deteriorate LiDAR-based localization and mapping. This work introduces a new probabilistic method to detect and mitigate the effect of degeneracies in point-to-plane error minimization. The noise on the Hessian of the point-to-plane optimization problem is characterized by the noise on points and surface normals used in its construction. We exploit this characterization to quantify the probability of a direction being degenerate. The degeneracy-detection procedure is used in a new real-time degeneracy-aware iterative closest point algorithm for LiDAR registration, in which we smoothly attenuate updates in degenerate directions. The method's parameters are selected based on the noise characteristics provided in the LiDAR's datasheet. We validate the approach in four real-world experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods at detecting and mitigating the adverse effects of degeneracies. For the benefit of the community, we release the code for the method at: github.com/ntnu-arl/drpm.

### [SCE-LIO: An Enhanced Lidar Inertial Odometry by Constructing Submap Constraints]()

In lidar-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, loop closure detection is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of odometry. However, constraints from loop closure detection are only provided when a loop is detected and can only enhance odometry accuracy at specific moments. Therefore, this paper proposes a lidar inertial odometry system that periodically provides submap constraints to the pose graph and enhances odometry accuracy through pose graph optimization. In the process of creating submap constraints, the system represents lidar keyframes as a collection of submaps containing overlapping information. The optimal pose transformations between submaps, determined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm with point-to-line and point-to-plane methods, are recognized as submap constraints. During the backend optimization phase, submap constraints and adjacent lidar keyframe constraints are integrated into the pose graph.The pose graph is then optimized using the pose graph optimization method to achieve the optimal lidar pose estimation. Additionally, To further enhance pose estimation, point-to-plane correspondence is established by considering the differences in normal vectors of feature points between the scan and the map, and integrated initial positioning module is created by incorporating preintegration and scan-to-scan matching. The results of simulation, public datasets and vehicle experiments show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is significantly improved compared to the advanced SLAM algorithm.

### [HDPlanner: Advancing Autonomous Deployments in Unknown Environments through Hierarchical Decision Networks]()

In this paper, we introduce HDPlanner, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework designed to tackle two core and challenging tasks for mobile robots: autonomous exploration and navigation, where the robot must optimize its trajectory adaptively to achieve the task objective through continuous interactions in unknown environments. Specifically, HDPlanner relies on novel hierarchical attention networksto empower the robot to reason about its belief across multiple spatialscales and sequence collaborative decisions, where our networks decompose long-term objectives into short-term informative task assignments and informative path plannings. We further propose a contrastive learning-based joint optimization to enhance the robustnessof HDPlanner. We empirically demonstrate that HDPlanner significantly outperforms state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines on an extensive set of simulations, including hundreds of test maps andlarge-scale, complex Gazebo environments. Notably, HDPlanner achieves real-time planning with travel distances reduced by up to 35.7% compared to exploration benchmarks and by up to 16.5% than navigation benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate our approach on hardware, where itgenerates high-quality, adaptive trajectories in both indoor and outdoor environments, highlighting its real-world applicability withoutadditional training.

### [WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions Via Gaussian Splatting]()

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and rain streaks in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [RL-GSBridge: 3D Gaussian Splatting Based Real2Sim2Real Method for Robotic Manipulation Learning]()

Sim-to-Real refers to the process of transferring policies learned in simulation to the real world, which is crucial for achieving practical robotics applications. However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot simto-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. Then utilizing a GS editing approach to synchronize the rendering with the physics simulator, RL-GSBridge could reflect the visual interactions of the physical robot accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real experiments, including grasping and pickand-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D GS reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.

### [High-Quality 3D Creation from a Single Image Using Subject-Specific Knowledge Prior]()

In this paper, we address the critical bottleneck in robotics caused by the scarcity of diverse 3D data by presenting a novel two-stage approach for generating high-quality 3D models from a single image. This method is motivated by the need to efficiently expand 3D asset creation, particularly for robotics datasets, where the variety of object types is currently limited compared to general image datasets. Unlike previous methods that primarily rely on general diffusion priors, which often struggle to align with the reference image, our approach leverages subject-specific prior knowledge. By incorporating subject-specific priors in both geometry and texture, we ensure precise alignment between the generated 3D content and the reference object. Specifically, we introduce a shading mode-aware prior into the NeRF optimization process, enhancing the geometry and refining texture in the coarse outputs to achieve superior quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches. Our approach is well-suited for applications such as novel view synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D, particularly in the robotics field where diverse 3D data is essential.

### [LiDAR-EDIT: LiDAR Data Generation by Editing the Object Layouts in Real-World Scenes]()

We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real Lidar scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

### [TICMapNet: A Tightly Coupled Temporal Fusion Pipeline for Vectorized HD Map Learning]()

High-Definition (HD) map construction is essential for autonomous driving to accurately understand the surrounding environment. Most existing methods rely on single-frame inputs to predict local map, which often fail to effectively capture the temporal correlations between frames. This limitation results in discontinuities and instability in the generated map.To tackle this limitation, we propose a textit{Ti}ghtly textit{C}oupled temporal fusion textit{Map} textit{Net}work (TICMapNet). TICMapNet breaks down the fusion process into three sub-problems: PV feature alignment, BEV feature adjustment, and Query feature fusion. By doing so, we effectively integrate temporal information at different stages through three plug-and-play modules, using the proposed tightly coupled strategy. Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not rely on camera extrinsic parameters, offering a new perspective for addressing the visual fusion challenge in the field of object detection. Experimental results show that TICMapNet significantly improves upon its single-frame baseline model, achieving at least a 7.0% increase in mAP using just two consecutive frames on the nuScenes dataset, while also showing generalizability across other tasks. The code and demos are available at url{https://github.com/adasfag/TICMapNet}.

### [DynaMoN: Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields]()

The accurate reconstruction of dynamic scenes with neural radiance fields is significantly dependent on the estimation of camera poses. Widely used structure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately tracking the camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene content and the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motion masks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation and statics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Our novel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updating the pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimation quality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the training process. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamic datasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoN improves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and trajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research in this area.

### [TransForce: Transferable Force Prediction for Vision-Based Tactile Sensors with Sequential Image Translation]()

Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) provide high-resolution tactile images crucial for robot in-hand manipulation. However, force sensing in VBTSs is underutilized due to the costly and time-intensive process of acquiring paired tactile images and force labels. In this study, we introduce a transferable force prediction model, TransForce, designed to leverage collected image-force paired data for new sensors under varying illumination colors and marker patterns while improving the accuracy of predicted forces, especially in the shear direction. Our model effectively achieves translation of tactile images from the source domain to the target domain, ensuring that the generated tactile images reflect the illumination colors and marker patterns of the new sensors while accurately aligning the elastomer deformation observed in existing sensors, which is beneficial to force prediction of new sensors. As such, a recurrent force prediction model trained with generated sequential tactile images and existing force labels is employed to estimate higher-accuracy forces for new sensors with lowest average errors of 0.69N (5.8% in full work range) in x-axis, 0.70N (5.8%) in y-axis, and 1.11N (6.9%) in z-axis compared with models trained with single images. The experimental results also reveal that pure marker modality is more helpful than the RGB modality in improving the accuracy of force in the shear direction, while the RGB modality show better performance in the normal direction.

### [HumanFT: A Human-Like Fingertip Multimodal Visuo-Tactile Sensor]()

Tactile sensors play a crucial role in enabling robots to interact effectively and safely with objects in everyday tasks. In particular, visuotactile sensors have seen increasing usage in two and three-fingered grippers due to their high-quality feedback. However, a significant gap remains in the development of sensors suitable for humanoid robots, especially five-fingered dexterous hands. One reason is because of the challenges in designing and manufacturing sensors that are compact in size. In this paper, we propose HumanFT, a multimodal visuotactile sensor that replicates the shape and functionality of a human fingertip. To bridge the gap between human and robotic tactile sensing, our sensor features real-time force measurements, high-frequency vibration detection, and overtemperature alerts. To achieve this, we developed a suite of fabrication techniques for a new type of elastomer optimized for force propagation and temperature sensing. Besides, our sensor integrates circuits capable of sensing pressure and vibration. These capabilities have been validated through experiments. The proposed design is simple and cost-effective to fabricate. We believe HumanFT can enhance humanoid robots' perception by capturing and interpreting multimodal tactile information.

### [FeelAnyForce: Estimating Contact Force Feedback from Tactile Sensation for Vision-Based Tactile Sensors]()

In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating 3D contact forces using vision-based tactile sensors. In particular, our goal is to estimate contact forces over a large range (up to 15 N) on any objects while generalizing across different vision-based tactile sensors. Thus, we collected a dataset of over 200K indentations using a robotic arm that pressed various indenters onto a GelSight Mini sensor mounted on a force sensor and then used the data to train a multi-head transformer for force regression. Strong generalization is achieved via accurate data collection and multi-objective optimization that leverages depth contact images. Despite being trained only on primitive shapes and textures, the regressor achieves a mean absolute error of 4% on a dataset of unseen real-world objects. We further evaluate our approach's generalization capability to other GelSight mini and DIGIT sensors, and propose a reproducible calibration procedure for adapting the pre-trained model to other vision-based sensors. Furthermore, the method was evaluated on real-world tasks, including weighing objects and controlling the deformation of delicate objects, which relies on accurate force feedback.

### [VITaL Pretraining: Visuo-Tactile Pretraining for Tactile and Non-Tactile Manipulation Policies]()

Tactile information is a critical tool for dexterous manipulation. As humans, we rely heavily on tactile information to understand objects in our environments and how to interact with them. We use touch not only to perform manipulation tasks but also to learn how to perform these tasks. Therefore, to create robotic agents that can learn to complete manipulation tasks at a human or super-human level of performance, we need to properly incorporate tactile information into both skill execution and skill learning. In this paper, we investigate how we can incorporate tactile information into imitation learning platforms to improve performance on manipulation tasks. We show that incorporating visuo-tactile pretraining improves imitation learning performance, not only for tactile agents (policies that use tactile information at inference), but also for non-tactile agents (policies that do not use tactile information at inference). For these non-tactile agents, pretraining with tactile information significantly improved performance (for example, improving the accuracy on USB plugging from 20% to 85%), reaching a level on par with visuo-tactile agents, and even surpassing them in some cases.

### [EasyCalib: Simple and Low-Cost In-Situ Calibration for Force Reconstruction with Vision-Based Tactile Sensors]()

For elastomer-based tactile sensors, represented by vision-based tactile sensors, routine calibration of mechanical parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) has been shown to be important for force reconstruction. However, the reliance on existing in-situ calibration methods for accurate force measurements limits their cost-effective and flexible applications. This article proposes a new in-situ calibration scheme that relies only on comparing contact deformation. Based on the detailed derivations of the normal contact and torsional contact theories, we designed a simple and low-cost calibration device, EasyCalib, and validated its effectiveness through extensive finite element analysis. We also explored the accuracy of EasyCalib in the practical application and demonstrated that accurate contact distributed force reconstruction can be realized based on the mechanical parameters obtained. EasyCalib balances low hardware cost, ease of operation, and low dependence on technical expertise and is expected to provide the necessary accuracy guarantees for wide applications of visuotactile sensors.

### [NormalFlow: Fast, Robust, and Accurate Contact-Based Object 6DoF Pose Tracking with Vision-Based Tactile Sensors]()

Tactile sensing is crucial for robots aiming to achieve human-level dexterity. Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands. Please also check our supplementary video to see our method in action.

### [From Ceilings to Walls: Universal Dynamic Perching of Small Aerial Robots on Surfaces with Variable Orientations]()

This work demonstrates universal dynamic perching capabilities for quadrotors of various sizes and on surfaces with different orientations. By employing a non-dimensionalization framework and deep reinforcement learning, we systematically assessed how robot size and surface orientation affect landing capabilities. We hypothesized that maintaining geometric proportions across different robot scales ensures consistent perching behavior, which was validated in both simulation and experimental tests. Additionally, we investigated the effects of joint stiffness and damping in the landing gear on perching behaviors and performance. While joint stiffness had minimal impact, joint damping ratios influenced landing success under vertical approaching conditions. The study also identified a critical velocity threshold necessary for successful perching, determined by the robot's maneuverability and leg geometry. Overall, this research advances robotic perching capabilities, offering insights into the role of mechanical design and scaling effects, and lays the groundwork for future drone autonomy and operational efficiency in unstructured environments.

### [Towards Perpetually-Deployable Ubiquitous Aerial Robotics: An Amphibious Self-Sustainable Solar Small-UAS]()

This work deals with the problem of unlocking perpetual deployment capabilities for small-UAS robotics across the diverse settings of the real world and their challenges, encompassing considerations for marine environments alongside the more common terrestrial ones. Via the progress made within this scope, a step towards truly ubiquitous and self-sustainable aerial robotics is accomplished. The work consists of the development of the Gannet Solar-VTOL, a waterproof small-UAS that is capable of resting on the surface of water for prolonged periods of time and over varying temperature ranges, while harvesting solar power to recharge itself. Equally importantly, it integrates a field-proven Self-Sustainable Autonomous System architecture that allows it to hibernate and sustain its battery charge overnight or during periods of solar illumination scarcity, as well as to assess mission-critical parameters (e.g., water surface turbulence, ambient temperature of battery compartment) on the low-power side of the Power Management Stack, and react appropriately. Finally, the robot is equipped with an onboard camera and a Neural Processing Unit that allows it to perform in-field environmental monitoring operations (e.g., wildfire detection). This paper experimentally demonstrates the aforementioned capabilities, and concludes with a presentation of the amphibious small-UAS' long-term deployment within a marine environment in the N.Nevada region, spanning over 3 consecutive days.

### [Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking]()

This paper presents a novel autonomous drone-based smoke plume tracking system capable of navigating and tracking plumes in highly unsteady atmospheric conditions. The system integrates advanced hardware and software and a comprehensive simulation environment to ensure robust performance in controlled and real-world settings. The quadrotor, equipped with a high-resolution imaging system and an advanced onboard computing unit, performs precise maneuvers while accurately detecting and tracking dynamic smoke plumes under fluctuating conditions. Our software implements a two-phase flight operation: descending into the smoke plume upon detection and continuously monitoring the smoke's movement during in-plume tracking. Leveraging Proportional Integral–Derivative (PID) control and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controller enables adaptation to plume dynamics. Unreal Engine simulation evaluates performance under various smoke-wind scenarios, from steady flow to complex, unsteady fluctuations, showing that while the PID controller performs adequately in simpler scenarios, the DRL-based controller excels in more challenging environments. Field tests corroborate these findings. This system opens new possibilities for drone-based monitoring in areas like wildfire management and air quality assessment. The successful integration of DRL for real-time decision-making advances autonomous drone control for dynamic environments.

### [EvMAPPER: High-Altitude Orthomapping with Event Cameras]()

Traditionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on CMOS-based cameras to collect images about the world below. One of the most successful applications of UAVs is to generate orthomosaics or orthomaps, in which a series of images are integrated to develop a larger map. However, using CMOS-based cameras with global or rolling shutters means that orthomaps are vulnerable to challenging light conditions, motion blur, and high-speed motion of independently moving objects (IMOs) under the camera. Event cameras are less sensitive to these issues, as their pixels trigger asynchronously on brightness changes. This work introduces the first orthomosaic approach using event cameras. We focus on addressing high-dynamic range and low-light problems in orthomosaics. In contrast to existing methods relying only on CMOS cameras, our approach enables map generation even in challenging light conditions, including direct sunlight and after sunset.

### [Survey of Simulators for Aerial Robots: An Overview and In-Depth Systematic Comparisons]()

Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) research faces challenges with safety, scalability, costs, and ecological impact when conducting hardware testing. High-fidelity simulators offer a vital solution by replicating real-world conditions to enable the development and evaluation of novel perception and control algorithms. However, the large number of available simulators poses a significant challenge for researchers to determine which simulator best suits their specific use-case, based on each simulator’s limitations and customization readiness. In this paper we present an overview of 44 UAV simulators, including in-depth, systematic comparisons for 14 of the simulators. Additionally, we present a set of decision factors for selection of simulators, aiming to enhance the efficiency and safety of research endeavors.

### [Robotics Meets Fluid Dynamics: A Characterization of the Induced Airflow below a Quadrotor As a Turbulent Jet]()

The widespread adoption of quadrotors for diverse applications, from agriculture to public safety, necessitates an understanding of the aerodynamic disturbances they create. This paper introduces a computationally lightweight model for estimating the time-averaged magnitude of the induced flow below quadrotors in hover. Unlike related approaches that rely on expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or drone specific time-consuming empirical measurements, our method leverages classical theory from turbulent flows. By analyzing over 16 hours of flight data from drones of varying sizes within a large motion capture system, we show for the first time that the combined flow from all drone propellers is well-approximated by a turbulent jet after 2.5 drone-diameters below the vehicle. Using a novel normalization and scaling, we experimentally identify model parameters that describe a unified mean velocity field below differently sized quadrotors. The model, which requires only the drone's mass, propeller size, and drone size for calculations, accurately describes the far-field airflow over a long-range in a very large volume which is impractible to simulate using CFD. Our model offers a practical tool for ensuring safer operations near humans, optimizing sensor placements and drone control in multi-agent scenarios. We demonstrate the latter by designing a controller that compensates for the downwash of another drone, leading to a four times lower altitude deviation when passing below.

### [CoDynTrust: Robust Asynchronous Collaborative Perception Via Dynamic Feature Trust Modulus]()

Collaborative perception, fusing information from multiple agents, can extend perception range so as to improve perception performance. However, temporal asynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock misalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information mismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is patchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception framework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal asynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each region of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as selectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby mitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module to handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing works that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust combats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios and allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning and control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly reduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal asynchrony. The code is available at https://github.com/CrazyShout/CoDynTrust.

### [The Devil Is in the Quality: Exploring Informative Samples for Semi-Supervised Monocular 3D Object Detection]()

This paper tackles the challenging problem of semi-supervised monocular 3D object detection with a general framework. In specific, having observed that the bottleneck of this task lies in lacking reliable and informative samples from unlabeled data for detector learning, we introduce a novel simple yet effective `Augment and Criticize' pipeline that mines abundant informative samples for robust detection. To be more specific, in the `Augment' stage, we present the Augmentation-based Prediction aGgregation (APG), which applies automatically learned transformations to unlabeled images and aggregates detections from various augmented views as pseudo labels. Since not all the pseudo labels from APG are beneficially informative, the subsequent `Criticize' phase is introduced. Particularly, we present the Critical Retraining Strategy (CRS) that, unlike simply filtering pseudo labels using a fixed threshold, employs a learnable network to evaluate the contribution of unlabeled images at different training timestamps. This way, the noisy samples prohibitive to model evolution can be effectively suppressed. In order to validate `Augment-Criticize', we apply it to MonoDLE and MonoFlex, and the two new detectors, dubbed 3DSeMo_DLE and 3DSeMo_FLEX, achieve state-of-the-art results with consistent improvements, evidencing its effectiveness and generality.

### [MonoCT: Overcoming Monocular 3D Detection Domain Shift with Consistent Teacher Models]()

We tackle the problem of monocular 3D object detection across different sensors, environments, and camera setups. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach, MonoCT, that generates highly accurate pseudo labels for self-supervision. Inspired by our observation that accurate depth estimation is critical to mitigating domain shifts, MonoCT introduces a novel Generalized Depth Enhance- ment (GDE) module with an ensemble concept to improve depth estimation accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a novel Pseudo Label Scoring (PLS) module by exploring inner-model consistency measurement and a Diversity Maximization (DM) strategy to further generate high-quality pseudo labels for self-training. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that MonoCT outperforms existing SOTA domain adaptation methods by large margins (∼21% minimum for AP Mod.) and generalizes well to car, traffic camera and drone views.

### [LiDAR Inertial Odometry and Mapping Using Learned Registration-Relevant Features]()

SLAM is an important capability for many autonomous systems, and modern LiDAR-based methods offer promising performance. However, for long duration missions, existing works that either take directly the full pointclouds or extracted features face key tradeoffs in accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., memory consumption). To address these issues, this paper presents DFLIOM with several key innovations. Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted heuristics and hand-tuned parameters for feature extraction, we propose a learning-based approach that select points relevant to LiDAR SLAM pointcloud registration. Furthermore, we extend our prior work DLIOM with the learned feature extractor and observe our method enables similar or even better localization performance using only about 20% of the points in the dense point clouds. We demonstrate that DFLIOM performs well on multiple public benchmarks, achieving a 2.4% decrease in localization error and 57.5% decrease in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods (DLIOM). Although extracting features with the proposed network requires extra time, it is offset by the faster processing time downstream, thus maintaining real-time performance using 20Hz LiDAR on our hardware setup. The effectiveness of our learning-based feature extraction module is further demonstrated through comparison with several handcrafted feature extractors.

### [DreamDrive: Generative 4D Scene Modeling from Street View Images]()

Synthesizing photo-realistic visual observations from an ego vehicle's driving trajectory is a critical step towards scalable training of self-driving models. Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present ourmethod{}, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and in-the-wild driving data demonstrate that ourmethod{} can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.

### [DISORF: A Distributed Online 3D Reconstruction Framework for Mobile Robots]()

We present a framework, DISORF, to enable online 3D reconstruction and visualization of scenes captured by resource-constrained mobile robots and edge devices. To address the limited computing capabilities of edge devices and potentially limited network availability, we design a framework that efficiently distributes computation between the edge device and the remote server. We leverage on-device SLAM systems to generate posed keyframes and transmit them to remote servers that can perform high-quality 3D reconstruction and visualization at runtime by leveraging recent advances in neural 3D methods. We identify a key challenge with online training where naive image sampling strategies can lead to significant degradation in rendering quality. We propose a novel shifted exponential frame sampling method that addresses this challenge for online training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling high-quality real-time reconstruction and visualization of unknown scenes as they are captured and streamed from cameras in mobile robots and edge devices.

### [Key-Scan-Based Mobile Robot Navigation: Integrated Mapping, Planning, and Control Using Graphs of Scan Regions]()

Safe autonomous navigation in a priori unknown environments is an essential skill for mobile robots to reliably and adaptively perform diverse tasks (e.g., delivery, inspection, and interaction) in unstructured cluttered environments. Hybrid metric-topological maps, constructed as a pose graph of local submaps, offer a computationally efficient world representation for adaptive mapping, planning, and control at the regional level. In this paper, we consider a pose graph of locally sensed star-convex scan regions as a metric-topological map, with star convexity enabling simple yet effective local navigation strategies. We design a new family of safe local scan navigation policies and present a perception-driven feedback motion planning method through the sequential composition of local scan navigation policies, enabling provably correct and safe robot navigation over the union of local scan regions. We introduce a new concept of frontier and bridging scans for automated key scan selection and exploration for integrated mapping and navigation in unknown environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our key-scan-based navigation and mapping framework using a mobile robot equipped with a 360˝ laser range scanner in 2D cluttered environments through numerical ROS-Gazebo simulations and real hardware experiments.

### [Angular Divergent Component of Motion: A Step towards Planning Spatial DCM Objectives for Legged Robots]()

In this work, the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) method is expanded to include angular coordinates for the first time. This work introduces the idea of spatial DCM, which adds an angular objective to the existing linear DCM theory. To incorporate the angular component into the framework, a discussion is provided on extending beyond the linear motion of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model (LIPM) towards the Single Rigid Body model (SRBM) for DCM. This work presents the angular DCM theory for a 1D rotation, simplifying the SRBM rotational dynamics to a flywheel to satisfy necessary linearity constraints. The 1D angular DCM is mathematically identical to the linear DCM and defined as an angle which is ahead of the current body rotation based on the angular velocity. This theory is combined into a 3D linear and 1D angular DCM framework, with discussion on the feasibility of simultaneously achieving both sets of objectives. A simulation in MATLAB and hardware results on the TORO humanoid are presented to validate the framework's performance.

### [Finite-Step Capturability and Recursive Feasibility for Bipedal Walking in Constrained Regions]()

This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation for bipedal footstep planning based on the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model, ensuring recursive feasibility when navigating restricted regions. The proposed approach incorporates capturability and introduces a new constraint that forces the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) into a finite-step capture region, adjusted between consecutive MPC calls. This constraint enables the MPC to anticipate beyond its prediction horizon, preventing collisions with the walking surface boundaries. We validate the approach through high-fidelity simulations with the bipedal robot Digit, demonstrating recursively feasible MPC footstep planning in restricted regions. Future efforts will extend the approach to general polytopic constraints, thereby facilitating footstep planning in cluttered environments while preserving the MPC's recursive feasibility.

### [Realtime Limb Trajectory Optimization for Humanoid Running through Centroidal Angular Momentum Dynamics]()

One of the essential aspects of humanoid robot running is determining the limb-swinging trajectories. During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.

### [Pitching Motion in a Humanoid Robot Using Human-Inspired Shoulder Elastic Energy and Motor Torque Optimization]()

Humanoid robots that mimic human movement have garnered significant attention in recent years. This study focuses on mimicking the efficient pitching motion of humans by incorporating two main approaches into a humanoid robot: (1) the use of elastic elements to assist joint torque, and (2) the optimization of motor torque to minimize energy consumption. This robot is intended to emulate human physical characteristics, such as mass, link length, and center of gravity, with a particular focus on utilizing the elastic energy generated during shoulder internal and external rotation. A leaf spring is attached in parallel with the motor at the shoulder pitch joint to release the elastic energy stored during shoulder external rotation, thereby assisting internal rotation in a manner similar to human biomechanics. Additionally, motor torque optimization is performed using Fujitsu's Digital Annealer to generate energy-efficient motions. Experiments conducted through simulations and with an actual pitching robot assessed the effectiveness of these technologies in mimicking human-like pitching motion. The results suggest that combining elastic elements with motion optimization techniques enable robots to achieve more efficient human-like movements.

### [Single-Stage Optimization of Open-Loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives]()

Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients. Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties.As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.

### [Iterative Periodic Running Control through Swept Angle Adjustment with Modified SLIP Model]()

This paper presents a periodic running control strategy based on a modified Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model to achieve stable running at various velocities. While the traditional SLIP model is valued for its simplicity and intuitive representation of running dynamics, its limitations impede its extension and integration with feedback control systems. To address this, we introduce a novel Quasi-Linearized SLIP model (QLSLIP) that incorporates additional forces in the radial and angular directions to enable stable running across various velocities. This model simplifies the analytical representation of the stance phase and defines the required swept anglefor maintaining periodic motion during the flight phase. Using this model, we develop a feedback control system that ensures the stability of QLSLIP-based periodic locomotion, even in the presence of external disturbances. This control framework optimizes trajectories and sustains periodic motion in real-time across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we propose an algorithm to extend this approach to articulated leg mechanisms. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithmis validated through simulations under various conditions, demonstrating improvements in the stability and performance of running.

### [Efficient, Responsive, and Robust Hopping on Deformable Terrain]()

Legged robot locomotion is hindered by a mismatch between applications featuring deformable substrates, where legs can outperform wheels or treads, and existing planners and controllers, most of which assume flat, rigid substrates. In this study we focus on the effects of plastic ground deformation on the hop-to-hop energy dynamics of a hopping robot driven by a switched-compliance energy injection controller. We derive a hop-to-hop energy return map, and we use experiments and simulations to validate this map for a real robot hopping on a real deformable substrate. By analyzing the map’s fixed points and eigenvalues, we identify constant-fixed-point surfaces in parameter space that suggest it is possible to tune control parameters for efficiency or responsiveness while targeting a desired gait energy level. We also identify conditions for which the map’s fixed points are globally stable, and we characterize the basins of attraction of fixed points when these conditions are not satisfied. We conclude by discussing the implications of this energy map for planning, control, and estimation for efficient, agile, and robust legged locomotion on deformable terrain.

### [Accounting for Hysteresis in the Forward Kinematics of Nonlinearly-Routed Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots Via a Learned Deep Decoder Network]()

Tendon-driven continuum robots have been gaining popularity in medical applications due to their ability to curve around complex anatomical structures, potentially reducing the invasiveness of surgery. However, accurate modeling is required to plan and control the movements of these flexible robots. Physics-based models have limitations due to unmodeled effects, leading to mismatches between model prediction and actual robot shape. Recently proposed learning-based methods have been shown to overcome some of these limitations but do not account for hysteresis, a significant source of error for these robots. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep decoder neural network that predicts the complete shape of tendon-driven robots using point clouds as the shape representation, conditioned on prior configurations to account for hysteresis. We evaluate our method on a physical tendon-driven robot and show that our network model accurately predicts the robot's shape, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art physics-based model and a learning-based model that does not account for hysteresis.

### [Graph-Based Spatial Reasoning for Tracking Landmarks in Dynamic Laparoscopic Environments]()

Accurate anatomical landmark tracking is crucial yet challenging in laparoscopic surgery due to the changing appearance of landmarks during dynamic tool-anatomy interactions and visual domain shifts between cases. Unlike appearance-based detection methods, this work proposes a novel graph-based approach to reconstruct the entire target landmark area by explicitly modeling the evolving spatial relations over time among scenario entities, including observable regions, surgical tools, and landmarks. Considering tool-anatomy interactions, we present the Tool-Anatomy Interaction Graph (TAI-G), a spatio-temporal graph that captures spatial dependencies among entities, attribute interactions within entities, and temporal dependencies of spatial relations. To mitigate domain shifts, geometric segmentation features are designated as node attributes, representing domain-invariant image information in the graph space. Message passing with attention helps propagate information across TAI-G, enhancing robust tracking by reconstructing landmark data. Evaluated on laparoscopic cholecystectomy, our framework demonstrates effective handling of complex tool-anatomy interactions and visual domain gaps to accurately track landmarks, showing promise in enhancing the stability and reliability of intricate surgical tasks.

### [A Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Image-Based Autonomous Guidewire Navigation]()

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involves the insertion of a catheter or guidewire into a blood vessel of a patient, which poses a problem as a doctor is exposed to radiation during the procedure. The use of assistive robots has been proposed to address this issue. Furthermore, recent research is progressing toward complete autonomous navigation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Nevertheless, existing algorithms face limitations when operating in numerous unseen environments close to real PCI. This study proposes a robust DRL framework for image-based guidewire navigation to overcome the limitation. We introduce a subtasks strategy and domain randomization to improve robustness in various environments. The subtasks strategy consistently addresses complex global tasks by breaking them into subtasks designed using local maps, allowing them to be robustly solved by a single agent. Domain randomization is applied to handle real PCI issues, including variations in vessel geometry, guidewire deformation, and camera settings. By integrating the two novel methods, our DRL algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across various challenging simulation and phantom environments, validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. A video of our experiment is available at url{https://youtu.be/93Q88gESzOY}.

### [An Adversarial Learning Framework for Reliable Myoelectric Force Estimation under Fatigue]()

Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used as control inputs for myoelectric exoskeletons. However, muscle fatigue, which can result from prolonged use or heavy loads, significantly affects muscle activation patterns, leading to reduced estimation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an adversarial learning framework to enhance grip force estimation under fatigue conditions. The framework consists of three key components: a domain-invariant feature extractor to mitigate domain shifts between non-fatigue and fatigue states, a force estimator to predict grip forces from these domain-invariant features, and a domain discriminator to distinguish between the two domains. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset collected from eight participants performing gripping tasks under both non-fatigue and fatigue conditions, during which high-density EMG signals and grip forces were recorded simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrated that our method significantly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.264 to 0.127, outperforming a baseline model consisting of only the feature extractor and force estimator ( p < 0.01). Additionally, the proposed approach exhibited consistent performance across all participants, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. These findings suggest that the proposed adversarial learning framework effectively enhances grip force estimation accuracy under muscle fatigue, offering a promising solution for improving the reliability and usability of myoelectric exoskeletons.

### [An Origami-Inspired Endoscopic Capsule with Tactile Perception for Early Tissue Anomaly Detection]()

Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) is currently one of the most effective methods for detecting intestinal diseases. However, it is challenging to detect early-stage small nodules with this method because they lack obvious color or shape features. In this letter, we present a new origami capsule endoscope to detect early small intestinal nodules using tactile sensing. Four soft tactile sensors made out of piezoresistive material feed four channels of phase-shifted data that are processed using a particle filter. The particle filter uses an importance assignment template designed using experimental data from six known sizes ofnodules. Moreover, the proposed capsule can use shape changes to passively move forward or backward under peristalsis, enabling it to reach any position in the intestine for detection. Experimental results show that the proposed capsule can detect nodules of more than 3mm diameter with 100% accuracy.

### [Exploring the Limitations and Implications of the JIGSAWS Dataset for Robot-Assisted Surgery]()

The JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) dataset has proven to be a foundational component of modern work on the skill analysis of robotic surgeons. In particular, methods using either the system's kinematics or video data have shown to be able to classify operators into distinct experience levels, and recent approaches have even ventured to recover numeric skill ratings assigned to assessment sessions. Although prior works have achieved positive results in these directions, challenges still remain with classification across all three levels of operator training amounts and objective skill rating regressions. To this end, we perform the first statistical analysis of the dataset itself and compile the results here. We find limited relationships between the amount of experience or training of an operator and their performance in JIGSAWS. Moreover, as operator-side kinematics have well-known relationships with their skill, previous works have used both robot and operator-side kinematics to classify operator skill; we find the first explicit relationships between pure robot-side kinematics and surgical performance. Finally, we analyze the robotic kinematic trends associated with high performance in JIGSAWS tasks and present how they may be used as indicators in human and automated surgeon training.

### [Path Planning Using Instruction-Guided Probabilistic Roadmaps]()

This work presents a novel data-driven path planning algorithm named Instruction-Guided Probabilistic Roadmap (IG-PRM). Despite the recent development and widespread use of mobile robot navigation, the safe and effective travels of mobile robots still require significant engineering effort to take into account the constraints of robots and their tasks. With IG-PRM, we aim to address this problem by allowing robot operators to specify such constraints through natural language instructions, such as ``aim for wider paths'' or ``mind small gaps''. The key idea is to convert such instructions into embedding vectors using large-language models (LLMs) and use the vectors as a condition to predict instruction-guided cost maps from occupancy maps. By constructing a roadmap based on the predicted costs, we can find instruction-guided paths via the standard shortest path search. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world indoor navigation environments.

### [Pushing through Clutter with Movability Awareness of Blocking Obstacles]()

Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) poses a challenge for traditional path-planning methods when obstacles block the path, requiring push actions to reach the goal. We propose a framework that enables movability-aware planning to overcome this challenge without relying on explicit obstacle placement. Our framework integrates a global Semantic Visibility Graph and a local Model Predictive Path Integral (SVG-MPPI) approach to efficiently sample rollouts, taking into account the continuous range of obstacle movability. A physics engine is adopted to simulate the interaction result of the rollouts with the environment, and generate trajectories with lower contact force. Qualitative and quantitative experiments suggest that SVG-MPPI outperforms existing paradigm that uses only binary movability for planning, achieving higher success rates with reduced cumulative contact forces. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tud-amr/SVG-MPPI

### [Improving Efficiency in Path Planning: Tangent Line Decomposition Algorithm]()

This paper introduces a tangent line decomposition (TLD) algorithm that efficiently finds collision-free paths close to optimal in both 2D and 3D environment. Compared with the existing visibility line-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm innovatively proposed the concept of tangent line decomposition, which decomposes complicated planning into many simple steps. For each step, only one key obstacle is taken into consideration. Besides, instead of constructing a complete graph, a best-first search algorithm is used to avoid searching redundant edges. The path planned by the algorithm is not the optimal path. However, following the idea of the informed RRT* algorithm, the path length planned by TLD can be used as a precondition for other optimal algorithms. In this way, the overall efficiency can be significantly improved. The simulations show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods regarding planning efficiency and solution quality.

### [Gradient Guided Search for Aircraft Contingency Landing Planning]()

This paper presents a three-dimensional discrete search path planner for fixed-wing aircraft emergency landing planning that manages state-space complexity by incorporating cost gradients to assure descent flight path angle and runway heading alignment constraints are met. Our approach incorporates steady wind and maximizes margin from flight envelope boundaries to accommodate wind variation in a manner commensurate with a loss of thrust condition. A novel multi-objective cost function that combines gradient-based path guidance and population risk metrics is implemented to efficiently enable discrete search to find a robust solution. The proposed method is demonstrated through use cases with population data for a region of Long Island, New York that highlight our algorithm's effectiveness.

### [Search-Based Path Planning in Interactive Environments among Movable Obstacles]()

This paper investigates Path planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO), which seeks a minimum cost collision-free path among static obstacles from start to goal while allowing the robot to push away movable obstacles (i.e., objects) along its path when needed. To develop planners that are complete and optimal for PAMO, the planner has to search a giant state space involving both the location of the robot as well as the locations of the objects, which grows exponentially with respect to the number of objects. This paper leverages a simple yet under-explored idea that, only a small fraction of this giant state space needs to be searched during planning as guided by a heuristic, and most of the objects far away from the robot are intact, which thus leads to runtime efficient algorithms. Based on this idea, this paper introduces two PAMO formulations, i.e., bi-objective and resource constrained problems in an occupancy grid, and develops PAMO*, a planning method with completeness and solution optimality guarantees, to solve the two problems. We then further extend PAMO* to hybrid-state PAMO* to plan in continuous spaces with high-fidelity interaction between the robot and the objects. Our results show that, PAMO* can often find optimal solutions within a second in cluttered maps with up to 400 objects.

### [Neural Encodings for Energy-Efficient Motion Planning]()

Neural motion planners can increase motion plan- ning quality and, by reducing collision detection computations, improve runtime. However, when profiled on an accelerator-rich hardware system, neural planning contributes to more than 50% of the runtime, and 33% of the computation energy consumption, motivating the design of compute- and energy-efficient neural planners. In this work, we propose a neural planner using Binary Encoded Labels (BEL), where a set of binary classifiers are used instead of a typical regression network. Compared to conventional regression-based neural planners, the proposed BEL neural planner reduces neural planning (inference) computation and collision detection checks while maintaining equal or higher motion planning success rate across various motion planning benchmarks. This computation reduction can improve the energy efficiency of neural planning by 1.4x−21.4x. Finally, we demonstrate the trade-offs between collision detection and neural planning computation to maximize energy efficiency for different hardware configurations.

### [Rigid Body Path Planning Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming]()

Navigating rigid body objects through crowded environments can be challenging, especially when narrow passages are presented. Existing sampling-based planners and optimization-based methods like mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, suffer from limited scalability with respect to either the size of the workspace or the number of obstacles. In order to address the scalability issue, we propose a three-stage algorithm that first generates a graph of convex polytopes in the workspace free of collision, then poses a large set of small MILPs to generate viable paths between polytopes, and finally queries a pair of start and end configurations for a feasible path online. The graph of convex polytopes serves as a decomposition of the free workspace and the number of decision variables in each MILP is limited by restricting the subproblem within two or three free polytopes rather than the entire free region. Our simulation results demonstrate shorter online computation time compared to baseline methods and scales better with the size of the environment and tunnel width than sampling-based planners in both 2D and 3D environments.

### [Strain-Coordinated Formation, Migration, and Encapsulation Behaviors in a Tethered Robot Collective]()

Tethers are an underutilized tool in multi-robot systems: tethers can provide power, facilitate retrieval and sensing, and be used to manipulate and gather objects. Starting with the simplest possible configuration, our work explores how agents linked in series by flexible, passive, fixed-length tethers, can use those tethers as sensors to achieve distributed formation control. In this study, we extend upon previous work to show the applicability of strain-coordinated formation control for encapsulation and migration along a global gradient as well as the trade-offs between formation control and taxis in an obstacle-laden environment. Our results indicate significant potential for tethered robot collectives: versatile behaviors that can work on simple, resource-constrained robots or serve as a fallback mechanism in case more sophisticated means of coordination fail.

### [Deep Learning-Enhanced Visual Monitoring in Hazardous Underwater Environments with a Swarm of Micro-Robots]()

Long-term monitoring and exploration of extreme environments, such as underwater storage facilities, is costly, labor-intensive, and hazardous. Automating this process with low-cost, collaborative robots can greatly improve efficiency. These robots capture images from different positions, which must be processed simultaneously to create a spatio-temporal model of the facility. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates data simulation, a multi-modal deep learning network for coordinate prediction, and image reassembly to address the challenges posed by environmental disturbances causing drift and rotation in the robots’ positions and orientations. Our approach enhances the precision of alignment in noisy environments by integrating visual information from snapshots, global positional context from masks, and noisy coordinates. We validate our method through extensive experiments using synthetic data that simulate real-world robotic operations in underwater settings. The results demonstrate very high coordinate prediction accuracy and plausible image assembly, indicating the real-world applicability of our approach. The assembled images provide clear and coherent views of the underwater environment for effective monitoring and inspection, showcasing the potential for broader use in extreme settings, further contributing to improved safety, efficiency, and cost reduction in hazardous field monitoring.

### [CapBot: Enabling Battery-Free Swarm Robotics]()

Swarm robotics focuses on designing and coordinating large groups of relatively simple robots to perform tasks in a decentralised and collective manner. The swarm provides a resilient and flexible solution for many applications. However, contemporary swarm robots have a significant power problem in that secondary (i.e. rechargeable) batteries are slow to charge and offer lifetimes of only a few years, increasing maintenance costs and pollution due to battery replacement.We imagine a different future, wherein battery free robots powered by supercapacitors can be recharged in seconds, offer long-life autonomous operation and can rapidly pass charge between one another using trophallaxis. In pursuit of this vision, we contribute the CapBot, a battery-free swarm robot equipped with Mecanum wheels, a Cortex M4F application processor and Bluetooth Low Energy networking. The CapBot fully recharges in 16 s, offers 51 min of autonomous operation at top speed, and can transfer up to 50% of its available charge to a peer via trophallaxis in under 20 s. The CapBot is fully open source and all software and hardware source is available online.

### [Express Yourself: Enabling Large-Scale Public Events Involving Multi-Human-Swarm Interaction for Social Applications with MOSAIX]()

Robot swarms have the potential to help groups of people with social tasks, given their ability to scale to large numbers of robots and users. Developing multi-human-swarm interaction is therefore crucial to support multiple people interacting with the swarm simultaneously - which is an area that is scarcely researched, unlike single-human, single-robot or single-human, multi-robot interaction. Moreover, most robots are still confined to laboratory settings. In this paper, we present our work with MOSAIX, a swarm of robot Tiles, that facilitated ideation at a science museum. 63 robots were used as a swarm of smart sticky notes, collecting input from the public and aggregating it based on themes, providing an evolving visualization tool that engaged visitors and fostered their participation. Our contribution lies in creating a large-scale (63 robots and 294 attendees) public event, with a completely decentralized swarm system in real-life settings. We also discuss learnings we obtained that might help future researchers create multi-human-swarm interaction with the public.

### [MochiSwarm: A Testbed for Robotic Micro-Blimps in Realistic Environments]()

Efficient energy management and scalability are critical for aerial robots in tasks such as pickup-and-delivery and surveillance. This paper introduces MochiSwarm, an open-source testbed of light-weight micro robotic blimps designed for multi-robot operation without external localization. We propose a modular system architecture that integrates adaptable hardware, a flexible software framework, and a detachable perception module. The hardware is designed to allow for rapid modifications and sensor integration, while the software supports multiple actuation models and robust communication between a base station and multiple blimps. We showcase a differential-drive module as an example, in which autonomy is enabled by visual servoing using the perception module. A case study of pickup-and-delivery tasks with up to 12 blimps highlights the autonomy of the MochiSwarm without relying on external infrastructures.

### [Exploring Unstructured Environments Using Minimal Sensing on Cooperative Nano-Drones]()

Recent advances have improved autonomous navigation and mapping under payload constraints, but current multi-robot inspection algorithms are unsuitable for nano-drones, due to their need for heavy sensors and high computational resources. To address these challenges, we introduce ExploreBug, a novel hybrid frontier range-bug algorithm designed to handle limited sensing capabilities for a swarm of nano-drones. This system includes three primary components: a mapping subsystem, an exploration subsystem, and a navigation subsystem. Additionally, an intra-swarm collision avoidance system is integrated to prevent collisions between drones. We validate the efficacy of our approach through extensive simulations and real-world exploration experiments, involving up to seven drones in simulations and three in real-world settings, across various obstacle configurations and with a maximum navigation speed of 0.75 m/s. Our tests prove that the algorithm efficiently completes exploration tasks, even with minimal sensing, across different swarm sizes and obstacle densities. Furthermore, our frontier allocation heuristic ensures an equal distribution of explored areas and paths traveled by each drone in the swarm. We publicly release the source code of the proposed system to foster further developments in mapping and exploration using autonomous nano drones.

### [Continuous Sculpting: Persistent Swarm Shape Formation Adaptable to Local Environmental Changes]()

Despite their growing popularity, swarms of robots remain limited by the operating time of each individual. We present algorithms which allow a human to sculpt a swarm of robots into a shape that persists in space perpetually, independent of onboard energy constraints such as batteries. Robots generate a path through a shape such that robots cycle in and out of the shape. Robots inside the shape react to human initiated changes and adapt the path through the shape accordingly. Robots outside the shape recharge and return to the shape so that the shape can persist indefinitely. The presented algorithms communicate shape changes throughout the swarm using message passing and robot motion. These algorithms enable the swarm to persist through any arbitrary changes to the shape. We describe these algorithms in detail and present their performance in simulation and on a swarm of mobile robots. The result is a swarm behavior more suitable for extended duration, dynamic shape-based tasks in applications such as entertainment, agriculture, and emergency response.

### [Kinematic Calibration of a Redundant Robot in Closed-Loop System Using Indicated Competitive Swarm Method]()

Previous calibration techniques often relied on specialized end-effector tracking devices, such as a laser tracker, which can be expensive and impractical in specific environments. Furthermore, research on the calibration of redundant manipulators has been relatively scarce compared to non-redundant counterparts. To overcome these limitations, this article introduces a novel method for kinematic calibration of a damaged redundant serial robot, employing an indicated competitive swarm optimization with a finite-screw deviation model. The proposed kinematic calibration method utilizes a kinematic closed-loop method, which identifies an axis deviation without using expensive end-effector tracking equipment. Moreover, a competitive-swarm-inspired optimization model is introduced to efficiently identify axis deviations, significantly reducing the required calibration points compared to prior studies and thereby facilitating calibration for redundant manipulators. Both simulation and experiment were conducted to validate the proposed method using a seven-degree-of-freedom redundant serial robot. The results demonstrate the proposed calibration method's effectiveness and practicality, which can be easily applied for a redundant robot calibration.

### [KFCalibNet: A KansFormer-Based Self-Calibration Network for Camera and LiDAR]()

In autonomous driving and robotic navigation, multi-sensor fusion technology has become increasingly mainstream, with precise sensor calibration as its foundation. Traditional calibration methods rely on manual effort or specific targets, limiting adaptability to complex environments. Learning-based calibration methods still face challenges, such as insufficient overlap between the fields of view (FoV) of multiple sensors and suboptimal cross-modal feature association, which hinder accurate parameter regression. Unlike traditional CNN-based networks, we propose a KansFormer-based self-Calibration Network for camera and LiDAR (KFCalibNet) that replaces fixed activation functions and linear transformations with learnable nonlinear activation functions. This enables the extraction of more fine-grained features from both image and point cloud, significantly enhancing the network's robustness in scenarios with limited FoV overlap. We also employ a multihead attention (MHA) module to compute correlations between image and point cloud features, significantly enhancing cross-modal feature association. To reduce learning complexity, we designed KansFormer with FastKAN as the feedforward network, enabling deep fusion and regression of fine-grained cross-modal features for accurate extrinsic calibration. KFCalibNet achieves an absolute average calibration error of 0.0965 cm in translation and 0.0234° in rotation on the KITTI Odometry dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art calibration methods. Moreover, its accuracy and generalization capability have been validated across multiple real-world railway lines.

### [Inducing Matrix Sparsity Bias for Improved Dynamic Identification of Parallel Kinematic Manipulators Using Deep Learning]()

Among the many challenges of parallel kinematic manipulators, achieving high-speed and accurate control remains crucial. Estimating their dynamic properties is essential for designing precise and efficient control schemes. Conventional methods for dynamic model identification have been effective, though deep learning approaches have historically faced limitations due to data inefficiencies. However, recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a way to improve both control and the extraction of interpretable physical properties from these robots. In this work, we propose and validate a PINN-based dynamic model for a Delta parallel robot, specifically the ABB IRB 360-6/1600. Our approach incorporates known physical properties, such as mass matrix sparsity, to improve accuracy and computational efficiency in dynamic model identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying PINNs to model parallel robots. The method is validated experimentally, and its performance is compared to a validated identification technique for physically consistent identification, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for real-world applications in parallel robots.

### [Infield Self-Calibration of Intrinsic Parameters for Two Rigidly Connected IMUs]()

This paper presents a study on the infield self-calibration of two rigidly connected IMUs' intrinsic parameters, without the aid of any external sensors, equipment, or specialized procedures. Specifically, we consider the calibration of gyroscope biases, gyroscope scale factors, and accelerometer biases, using only IMU data and known extrinsics between the two IMUs. We focus on the observability analysis of this system, and show that all gyroscope intrinsic parameters and a portion of accelerometer biases are observable, with information from both IMUs and sufficient motion. Moreover, we identify the additional unobservable directions in the intrinsic parameters that arise from various degenerate motions. Finally, we validate our observability findings through numerical simulations, and assess our system's calibration accuracy using real-world data.

### [PlaneHEC: Efficient Hand-Eye Calibration for Multi-View Robotic Arm Via Any Point Cloud Plane Detection]()

Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient. Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a comprehensive solution that starts with closed-form solution and improves it with iterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a strong contribution to the development of multi-agent system and embodied intelligence.

### [Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design for Robot Kinematic Calibration]()

This paper develops a Bayesian optimal experimental design for robot kinematic calibration on {mathbb{S}^3 !times! mathbb{R}^3}. Our method builds upon a Gaussian process approach that incorporates a geometry-aware kernel based on Riemannian Mat'ern kernels over {mathbb{S}^3}. To learn the forward kinematics errors via Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process, we define a geodesic distance-based objective function. Pointwise values of this function are sampled via noisy measurements taken using fiducial markers on the end-effector using a camera and computed pose with the nominal kinematics. The corrected Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are obtained using an efficient quadratic program that operates on the collected data sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulations and calibration experiments on NASA's ocean world lander autonomy testbed (OWLAT).

### [Automatic Target-Less Camera-LiDAR Calibration from Motion and Deep Point Correspondences]()

Sensor setups of robotic platforms commonly include both camera and LiDAR as they provide complementary information. However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at https://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [Legged Robot State Estimation with Invariant Extended Kalman Filter Using Neural Measurement Network]()

This paper introduces a novel proprioceptive state estimator for legged robots that combines model-based filters with deep neural networks. In environments where vision systems are not reliable, proprioceptive state estimators become indispensable. Traditionally, proprioceptive state estimators are based on model-based approaches, which rely solely on contact foot kinematics as measurements. In contrast, learning-based approaches have obtained new measurements, such as displacement and covariance, by leveraging real-world data in a supervised manner. In this work, we develop a state estimation framework that trains a neural measurement network (NMN) to estimate the base's linear velocity and foot contact probability, which are then employed as measurements in an invariant extended Kalman filter. Our approach relies solely on simulation data for training, as it allows us to obtain extensive data easily. We address the sim-to-real gap by adapting existing learning techniques and regularization. To validate our proposed method, we conduct hardware experiments using a quadruped robot on four types of terrain: flat, debris, soft, and slippery. In our experiments, the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over the model-based state estimator, achieving an average reduction in Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 61.8% for position and 8.5% for velocity.

### [Physically-Consistent Parameter Identification of Robots in Contact]()

Accurate inertial parameter identification is crucial for the simulation and control of robots encountering intermittent contacts with the environment. Classically, robots' inertial parameters are obtained from CAD models that are not precise (and sometimes not available, e.g., Spot from Boston Dynamics), hence requiring identification. To do that, existing methods require access to contact force measurement, a modality not present in modern quadruped and humanoid robots. This paper presents an alternative technique that utilizes joint current/torque measurements —a standard sensing modality in modern robots— to identify inertial parameters without requiring direct contact force measurements. By projecting the whole-body dynamics into the null space of contact constraints, we eliminate the dependency on contact forces and reformulate the identification problem as a linear matrix inequality that can handle physical and geometrical constraints. We compare our proposed method against a common black-box identification method using a deep neural network and show that incorporating physical consistency significantly improves the sample efficiency and generalizability of the model. Finally, we validate our method on the Spot quadruped robot across various locomotion tasks, showcasing its accuracy and generalizability in real-world scenarios over different gaits.

### [Contact Force Estimation for a Leg-Wheel Transformable Robot with Varying Contact Points]()

Accurate estimation of contact forces is crucial for the effective control of quadrupedal robots, especially in complex locomotion scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel force estimation technique for robots equipped with transformable leg-wheels. Unlike conventional methods that focus on forces at specific contact points, our approach expresses varying contact points through a simplified kinematic model and derives the corresponding Jacobian matrices. This allows us to apply the virtual work method to evaluate contact forces across the entire surface of the leg-wheel, including the tips, sides, and other contact regions. This adaptability is particularly advantageous in hybrid locomotion modes, where different parts of the leg-wheel interact with the terrain. The proposed method is highly efficient, relying solely on motor current and position feedback without the need for additional sensors. We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its accuracy, robustness, and applicability under diverse operational conditions.

### [Simultaneous Collision Detection and Force Estimation for Dynamic Quadrupedal Locomotion]()

In this paper we address the simultaneous collision detection and force estimation problem for quadrupedal loco- motion using joint encoder information and the robot dynamics only. We design an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM-KF) that estimates the external force exerted on the robot and multiple possible contact modes. The method is invariant to any gait pattern design. Our approach leverages pseudo-measurement information of the external forces based on the robot dynamics and encoder information. Based on the estimated contact mode and external force, we design a reflex motion and an admittance controller for the swing leg to avoid collisions by adjusting the leg’s reference motion. Additionally, we implement a force-adaptive model predictive controller to enhance balancing. Simulation ablatation studies and experiments show the efficacy of the approach.

### [PROBE: Proprioceptive Obstacle Detection and Estimation While Navigating in Clutter]()

In critical applications, including search-and- rescue in degraded environments, blockages can be prevalent and prevent the effective deployment of certain sensing modalities, particularly vision, due to occlusion and the constrained range of view of onboard camera sensors. To enable robots to tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach, Proprioceptive Obstacle Detection and Estimation while navigating in clutter (PROBE), which instead relies only on the robot’s proprioception to infer the presence or absence of occluded rectangular obstacles while predicting their dimensions and poses in SE(2). The proposed approach is a Transformer neural network that receives as input a history of applied torques and sensed whole-body movements of the robot and returns a parameterized representation of the obstacles in the environment. The effectiveness of PROBE is evaluated on simulated environments in Isaac Gym and with a real Unitree Go1 quadruped robot.

### [Fast Decentralized State Estimation for Legged Robot Locomotion Via EKF and MHE]()

In this paper, we present a fast and decentralized state estimation framework for the control of legged locomotion. The nonlinear estimation of the floating base states is decentralized to an orientation estimation via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a linear velocity estimation via Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). The EKF fuses the inertia sensor with vision to estimate the floating base orientation. The MHE uses the estimated orientation with all the sensors within a time window in the past to estimate the linear velocities based on a time-varying linear dynamics formulation of the interested states with state constraints. More importantly, a marginalization method based on the optimization structure of the full information filter (FIF) is proposed to convert the equality-constrained FIF to an equivalent MHE. This decoupling of state estimation promotes the desired balance of computation efficiency, accuracy of estimation, and the inclusion of state constraints. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate state estimation to several legged robots, including the highly dynamic hopping robot PogoX, the bipedal robot Cassie, and the quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency at 200 Hz and a window interval of 0.1s.

### [Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot (E-BAR): A Robot System for Body-Weight Support, Ambulation Assistance, and Fall Catching, without the Use of a Harness]()

As over 11,000 people turn 65 each day in the U.S., our country, like many others, is facing growing challenges in caring for elderly persons, further exacerbated by a major shortfall of care workers. To address this, we introduce an eldercare robot (E-BAR) capable of lifting a human body, assisting with postural changes/ambulation, and catching a user during a fall, all without the use of any wearable device or harness. Our robot is the first to integrate these 3 tasks, and is capable of lifting the full weight of a human outside of the robot’s base of support (across gaps and obstacles). In developing E-BAR, we interviewed nurses and care professionals and conducted user-experience tests with elderly persons. Based on their functional requirements, the design parameters were optimized using a computational model and trade-off analysis. We developed a novel 18-bar linkage to lift a person from a floor to a standing position along a natural trajectory, while providing maximal mechanical advantage at key points. An omnidirectional, non-holonomic drive base, in which the wheels could be oriented to passively maximize floor grip, enabled the robot to resist lateral forces without active compensation. With a minimum width of 38 cm, the robot’s small footprint allowed it to navigate the typical home environment. Four airbags were used to catch and stabilize a user during a fall in less than 250 ms. We demonstrate E-BAR's utility in multiple typical home scenarios, including getting into/out of a bathtub, bending to reach for objects, sit-to-stand transitions, and ambulation.

### [A Cane-Mounted System for Dynamic Orientation Prediction for Correcting Incorrect Cane-Tapping by Visually Challenged Persons]()

People with visual impairments rely on Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs), such as sensor-equipped guide canes, for safe and effective navigation. Misalignment or improper handling of these devices can reduce their effectiveness, increasing the risk of collisions and injuries. This paper presents an AI-based embedded system designed to predict and correct the orientation of a guide cane in real time. By integrating an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with a neural network, the system continuously monitors the cane's lateral angle and orientation while providing feedback to help the user self-correct. The feedback is proportional to the degree of error, guiding users to maintain proper cane positioning during mobility. The device logs data that can be visualized remotely, offering mobility trainers valuable insights into the user's navigation patterns. Evaluation by visually impaired users demonstrated that the system effectively aided in real-time orientation correction. This system represents a significant advancement in improving the safety and independence of individuals with visual impairments through wearable ETAs.

### [SRL-Gym: A Morphology and Controller Co-Optimization Framework for Supernumerary Robotic Limbs in Load-Bearing Locomotion]()

Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can assist human motions by providing extra degrees of freedom (DoFs) and body support. The extra DoFs lead to larger design space in structure and control policies, which is complex and timeconsuming with the traditional manual design process. In this pilot study, we proposed a novel morphology-controller cooptimization framework to automatically generate and optimize the SRL structure based on the locomotion task input. There are two layers, with the inner layer optimizing the controller to achieve human-robot synchronization, and the outer layer optimizing the morphology parameters for performance enhancement. We validated the proposed framework through simulations using SRLs in a load-bearing locomotion task. The results demonstrate that the controller optimization can automatically generate realistic gait patterns and stable humanrobot synchronization, while the SRLs significantly improve the user’s load-bearing capability. Additionally, the co-optimization process reduces both the manufacturing cost of the SRL and the torque on the joints. This approach shows potential for exhaustive exploration of the design space and acceleration of the design process. Future works will be done in a more realistic SRL generative design model and achieve Sim2Real for practical uses.

### [Adaptive Walker: User Intention and Terrain Aware Intelligent Walker with High-Resolution Tactile and IMU Sensor]()

In this paper, we present an adaptive walker system designed to address limitations in current intelligent walker technologies. While recent advancements have been made in this field, existing systems often struggle to seamlessly interpret user intent for speed control and lack adaptability across diverse scenarios and terrain. Our proposed solution incorporates high-resolution tactile sensors, deep learning algorithms, IMU sensors, and linear motors to dynamically adjust to the user’s intentions and terrain changes. The system is capable of predicting the user’s desired speed with an error margin of only 20.99%, relying solely on tactile input from hand and arm contact points. Additionally, it maintains the walker’s horizontal stability with an error of less than 1 degree by adjusting leg lengths in response to variations in ground angle. This adaptive walker enhances user safety and comfort, particularly for individuals with reduced strength or cognitive abilities, and offers reliable assistance on uneven terrain such as uphill and downhill paths.

### [IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition]()

Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot’s capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach’s robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves an improvement up to 35% in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.

### [An Interactive Hands-Free Controller for a Riding Ballbot to Enable Simple Shared Control Tasks]()

Our team developed a riding ballbot (called PURE) that is dynamically stable, omnidirectional, and driven by lean-to-steer control. A hands-free admittance control scheme (HACS) was previously integrated to allow riders with different torso functions to control the robot's movements via torso leaning and twisting. Such an interface requires motor coordination skills and could result in collisions with obstacles due to low proficiency. Hence, a shared controller (SC) that limits the speed of PURE could be helpful to ensure the safety of riders. However, the self-balancing dynamics of PURE could result in a weak control authority of its motion, in which the torso motion of the rider could easily result in poor tracking of the command speed dictated by the shared controller. Thus, we proposed an interactive hands-free admittance control scheme (iHACS), which added two modules to the HACS to improve the speed-tracking performance of PURE: control gain personalization module and interaction compensation module. Human riding tests of simple tasks, idle-keeping and speed-limiting, were conducted to compare the performance of HACS and iHACS. Two manual wheelchair users and two able-bodied individuals participated in this study. They were instructed to use ``adversarial" torso motions that would tax the SC's ability to keep the ballbot idling or below a set speed, i.e., competing objectives between rider and robot. In the idle-keeping tasks, iHACS demonstrated minimal translational motion and low command speed tracking RMSE, even with significant torso lean angles. During the speed-limiting task, where the commanded speed was saturated at 0.5 m/s, the system achieved an average maximum speed of 1.1 m/s with iHACS, compared with that of over 1.9 m/s with HACS. These results suggest that iHACS can enhance PURE's control authority over the rider, which enables PURE to provide physical interactions back to the rider and results in a collaborative rider-robot synergy.

### [Garment Diffusion Models for Robot-Assisted Dressing]()

Robots have the potential to assist people with disabilities and the elderly. One of the most common and burdensome tasks for caregivers is dressing. Two challenges of robot-assisted dressing are modeling the dynamics of garments and handling visual occlusions that obstruct the perception of the full state of the garment due to the proximity between the garment, the robot, and the human. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based dynamics model for garments during robot-assisted dressing that can deal with partial point cloud observations. The diffusion model, conditioned on the observation and the robot's action, is used to predict a full point cloud of the garment's opening of the future state. The model is utilized in a model predictive controller, that is trained iteratively with model-based reinforcement learning. In our experiments, we examine a common problem of dressing: the insertion of a garment's sleeve on an arm. As demonstrated by the performed experiments, the proposed diffusion-based model predictive controller can be effectively used for robot-assisted dressing and handle visual occlusions. Moreover, our approach is highly sample-efficient. Specifically, the controller achieved 91.2% success rate in the examined dressing task with less than 100 sampled trajectories. Real-wold experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to the sim-to-real gap and generalize well to novel garments and configurations of the body.

### [Pedestrian Intention and Trajectory Prediction in Unstructured Traffic Using IDD-PeD]()

With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle’s attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to 15%, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to 1208 MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

### [Visual-Linguistic Reasoning for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction]()

Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent on roads. The dynamic nature of urban environments and the less predictable behavior of pedestrians present significant challenges in developing reliable prediction models. Earlier methods relying on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promise, but often fail to fully take advantage of the rich visual and contextual information available in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer new opportunities to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by incorporating multimodal reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses a powerful pre-trained VLM to improve the estimation of pedestrian trajectories. Specifically, we first enable learning of semantically useful scene context and high-level reasoning feature via vision-language model fine-tuning on specific prompts using road scenes with pedestrians. Next, with the learned VLM features and the pedestrian's past trajectory history, we predict future trajectories using an encoder-decoder head. Through experiments with first-person datasets JAAD and PIE, we show that utilizing visual-linguistic semantics via a pre-trained vision-language model outperforms previous methods in both deterministic and stochastic trajectory prediction setups.

### [Curb Your Attention: Causal Attention Gating for Robust Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving]()

Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent’s behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents’ trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle’s decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose Causal tRajecTory predICtion (CRiTIC), a novel model that utilizes a causal discovery network to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel Causal Attention Gating mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to 54% without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to 29% improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

### [Open3DTrack: Towards Open-Vocabulary 3D Multi-Object Tracking]()

3D multi-object tracking plays a critical role in autonomous driving by enabling the real-time monitoring and prediction of multiple objects' movements. Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we introduce open-vocabulary 3D tracking, which extends the scope of 3D tracking to include objects beyond predefined categories. We formulate the problem of open-vocabulary 3D tracking and introduce dataset splits designed to represent various open-vocabulary scenarios. We propose a novel approach that integrates open-vocabulary capabilities into a 3D tracking framework, allowing for generalization to unseen object classes. Our method effectively reduces the performance gap between tracking known and novel objects through strategic adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our method in diverse outdoor driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address open-vocabulary 3D tracking, presenting a significant advancement for autonomous systems in real-world settings.

### [Asynchronous Multi-Object Tracking with an Event Camera]()

Events cameras are ideal sensors for enabling robots to detect and track objects in highly dynamic environments due to their low latency output, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. In this paper, we present the Asynchronous Event Multi-Object Tracking (AEMOT) algorithm for detecting and tracking multiple objects by processing individual raw events asynchronously. AEMOT detects salient event blob features by identifying regions of consistent optical flow using a novel Field of Active Flow Directions built from the Surface of Active Events. Detected features are tracked as candidate objects using the recently proposed Asynchronous Event Blob (AEB) tracker in order to construct small intensity patches of each candidate object. A novel learnt validation stage promotes or discards candidate objects based on classification of their intensity patches, with promoted objects having their position, velocity, size, and orientation estimated at their event rate. We evaluate AEMOT on a new Bee Swarm Dataset, where it tracks dozens of small bees with precision and recall performance exceeding that of alternative event-based detection and tracking algorithms by over 37%. Source code and the labelled event Bee Swarm Dataset will be open sourced.

### [Co-MTP: A Cooperative Trajectory Prediction Framework with Multi-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving]()

Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction. Our code is available on our project website: https://xiaomiaozhang.github.io/Co-MTP/

Using GP regression, the method learns and predicts the opponent’s trajectory, enabling the ego vehicle to calculate safe and effective overtaking maneuvers. Experimentally validated on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform, Predictive Spliner outperforms commonly employed overtaking algorithms by overtaking opponents at up to 83.1% of its own speed, being on average 8.4% faster than the previous best-performing method. Additionally, it achieves an average success rate of 84.5%, which is 47.6% higher than the previous best-performing method. The proposed algorithm maintains computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications. These results highlight the potential of Predictive Spliner to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous racing vehicles.

### [Workspace Expansion of Magnetic Soft Continuum Robot Using Movable Opposite Magnet]()

Recently, in the minimally invasive surgery field, magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have been actively studied, which are driven by an external magnetic field with a small magnet attached to the tip of the SCR. In addition, MSCR with opposite magnets (MSCR-OMs) has been reported for high dexterity, which has a small permanent magnet attached to the end of the MSCR and an additional opposite magnet fixed in the middle. To overcome the limitations of the existing MSCR and MSCR-OM and improve the workspace, we proposed a magnetic soft continuum robot with a movable opposite magnet (MSCR-MOM) with a 2.2 mm diameter and 10cm length, that can change the position of the opposite magnet. In this study, an analytical model of the proposed MSCR-MOM was presented, and through simulation and various experiments, its characteristics were analyzed and the workspace expansion was validated. In addition, the clinical applicability of the proposed MSCR-MOM was verified through phantom experiments. In the future, we expect that the proposed MSCR-MOM will be developed into a medical catheter that can be applied in various procedures through miniaturization and various clinical application studies.

### [Design and Implementation of a Snake Robot for Cranial Surgery]()

Craniosynostosis involves premature fusion of the cranial sutures resulting in abnormal skull morphology and elevated intracranial pressure. Surgical intervention is necessary to correct the skull shape and to allow for unrestricted brain growth. This study presents a novel snake robot designed for minimally invasive cranial osteotomies featuring two articulating bending segments. The end-effector comprises a bone-punch for bone-cutting, a dural and scalp retractor, as well as channels for an endoscope and an instrument. The robot’s bending mechanism is driven by tendons and utilizes geared linkages to facilitate a smooth curved shape. Pre-tensioned antagonistic tendons allow the robot to modulate its stiffness to adapt to external loads. A follow-the-leader algorithm was implemented to guide the robot along a skull cutting path. Experimental results demonstrated that at maximum bending of 60◦ for segment 1 and 90◦ for segment 2 there was a 15.9◦ and 11.5◦ error, respectively. Position errors ranged from 2.5 to 21.5mm when tracing a curved path. The tool increased stiffness with tendon pre-tensioning from 20-100N during bent configurations q1 and q2 for segments 1 and 2, respectively, at [q1,q2] = [0◦,30◦] and [30◦,60◦]. Tip deflection reduced from 0.42 to 0.03cm and 0.37 to 0.10cm during axial loading and from 11.40 to 3.88cm and 3.62 to 0.48cm during radial loading for each configuration, respectively. Ex vitro trials demonstrated the robots ability to perform simulated osteotomies on skull models to 68-73% of desired path lengths with a maximum deviation of 8mm.

To address the challenges associated with shape sensing of continuum manipulators (CMs) using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) optical fibers, we present a unique shape sensing assembly utilizing solely a single Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) fiber attached to a flat nitinol wire (NiTi).Integrating this easy-to-manufacture unique sensor with a long and soft CM with 170 mm length, we performed different experiments to evaluate its C-, J-, and S-shape reconstruction ability. Results demonstrate phenomenal shape reconstruction accuracy for the performed C-shape (< 3.14 mm tip error, < 2.54 mm shape error), J-shape (< 1.91 mm tip error, < 1.11 mm shape error), and S-shape (< 1.74 mm tip error, < 1.40 mm shape error) experiments.

### [Learning-Based Tip Contact Force Estimation for FBG-Embedded Continuum Robots]()

Knowledge of the tip contact force in continuum robots, which are often used as medical instruments, is critical for clinical applications. It enhances the interventionalist's decision-making, navigation efficiency, and procedural safety. However, accurately determining the tip contact force in conventionally sized instruments remains challenging. This study introduces a learning-based method for estimating the external contact force at the tip of a continuum robot. By leveraging curvature and bending angle data from a multi-core fiber equipped with fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) embedded inside the Nitinol tube, the method maps these inputs to the corresponding tip force in 3D. Experiments conducted on an FBG-embedded Nitinol rod validate the feasibility of the proposed method, yielding Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of 20.9 (mN 2 ), 2.7 (mN), and 4.6 (mN), respectively, which represent a 26% improvement compared to the learning-based vision methodology.

### [Three-Dimension Tip Force Perception and Axial Contact Location Identification for Flexible Endoscopy Using Tissue-Compliant Soft Distal Attachment Cap Sensors]()

In endoluminal surgeries, inserting a flexible endoscope is one of the fundamental procedures. During this process, vision remains the primary feedback, while the perception of tactile magnitude and location is insufficient. This limitation can hinder the clinician’s efficiency when navigating the endoscope through various segments of the natural lumens. To address this issue, we propose a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)–based tissue-compliant sensor cap with multi-mode sensing capabilities, including contact location identification at the terminal surface and the three-dimensional contact force perception at the tip. The soft sensor cap can be affixed to the standard endoscope tip, like a distal attachment cap, for easy installation. Utilizing the relative contact location information, operators can adjust the steerable segment of the endoscope when transitioning from one segment of a natural orifice to a narrower segment, which may be obstructed by constricted lumens. A finite element analysis simulation and the corresponding calibration process based on learning-based approaches have been carried out. The FBG-based sensor can perceive the tip contact force and identify the axial contact location with high precision, where the force perception error is less than 3%, and the contact location identification accuracy is 98.8%. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed sensing mechanism to be applied in surgeries requiring endoscope insertions.

### [MPC Design of a Continuum Robot for Pulmonary Interventional Surgery Using Koopman Operators]()

This study focuses on the flexible tube of a bronchoscope robot used in pulmonary intervention surgery, which is considered as a continuum robot. The dynamics model is proposed based on the Koopman operator, leveraging real data to solve for the system matrix parameters accurately. To enhance control precision, we designed a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm aimed at tracking the desired curvature and deflection angles of the flexible tube. The MPC controller uses real-time data from electromagnetic sensors to adjust the tube shape, ensuring accurate and responsive manipulation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through extensive experiments conducted on the Binary experimental platform, demonstrating significant improvements in tracking performance and operational reliability compared to traditional open-loop control methods.

### [A Perturbation-Robust Framework for Admittance Control of Robotic Systems with High-Stiffness Contacts and Heavy Payload]()

Applications involving serial manipulators, in both co-manipulation with humans and autonomous operation tasks, require the robot to render high admittance so as to minimize contact forces and maintain stable contacts with high-stiffness surfaces. This can be achieved through admittance control, however, inner loop dynamics limit the bandwidth within which the desired admittance can be rendered from the outer loop. Moreover, perturbations affect the admittance control performance whereas other system specific limitations such as “black box” PD position control in typical industrial manipulators hinder the implementation of more advanced control methods. To address these challenges, a perturbation-robust multisensor framework, designed for serial manipulators engaged in contact-rich tasks involving heavy payloads, is introduced in this paper. Within this framework, a generalized perturbation-robust observer (PROB), which exploits the joint velocity measurements and inner loop velocity control model, and accommodates the varying stiffness of contacts through contact force measurements is introduced. Three PROBs including a novel Combined Dynamics Observer (CDYOB) are presented. The CDYOB can render wide-range admittance without bandwidth limitations from the inner loop. Theoretical analyses and experiments with an industrial robot validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Tension Maintenance Mechanism for Control Consistency of Twisted String Actuation-Based Hyper-Redundant Manipulator]()

Hyper-redundant manipulators have been developed for hazardous environment exploration due to their flexibility and high agility in workplace. In this research, we designed a hyper-redundant manipulator by integrating Twisted String Actuators (TSAs) and Rolling Contact Joints (RCJs) to overcome the limitations of traditional cable-driven system, such as difficulties with long-distance power transmission, and to achieve high payload capability with a compact design. To prevent instantaneous tension loss by the slack and to enhance control consistency of the manipulator by preserving the relationship between contraction ratio of TSA and motor rotations, we proposed a tension maintenance mechanism using compression springs at the distal end of the manipulator. Additionally, to reduce losses from string contact friction, spring sheaths were inserted along the joint holes. Our approaches enhance the repeatability and position controllability of the manipulator. We noted a 33.5% reduction of error in repeatability test along with 35.9% and 38.8% improvements in piecewise position control accuracy and precision compared to a conventional manipulator, respectively, leading to enhanced controllability. We also experimentally verified that the proposed manipulator can maintain its trajectory with a variance of less than 2.83% up to 1600 g. Overall, our manipulator has the potential to expand the exploration environments in which robots can be used by simultaneously demonstrating large payload and controllability.

### [The Franka Emika Robot: A Standard Platform in Robotics Research]()

Over the last decade, industrial robots have evolved from well-established position-controlled systems to collaborative and soft robots. In 2017 we introduced the tactile lightweight robot system Franka Emika Robot, characterized by advanced safety control, force sensing, joint torque and force control, and hand-guiding performance. In the meantime, the system has become a well-adopted reference platform for robotics research in AI and machine learning, manipulation, control, human-robot interaction, and motion planning. It features multiple functional and widely used interfaces, including 1kHz real-time joint torque control access or precise kinematic and dynamic models. Furthermore, it became a crystallization point of a research ecosystem since the system's affordability further lowered the entrance barrier to high-performance joint torque-controlled robots. In this article, a quantitative analysis and discussion of the use of the system in worldwide research labs over the last five years, its impact on the creation of a compatible software ecosystem, and examples of milestone experiments made possible with the robot are given.

### [MeshDMP: Motion Planning on Discrete Manifolds Using Dynamic Movement Primitives]()

An open problem in industrial automation is to reliably perform tasks requiring in-contact movements with complex workpieces, as current solutions lack the ability to seamlessly adapt to the workpiece geometry. In this paper, we propose a Learning from Demonstration approach that allows a robot manipulator to learn and generalise motions across complex surfaces by leveraging differential mathematical operators on discrete manifolds to embed information on the geometry of the workpiece extracted from triangular meshes, and extend the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) framework to generate motions on the mesh surfaces. We also propose an effective strategy to adapt the motion to different surfaces, by introducing an isometric transformation of the learned forcing term. The resulting approach, namely MeshDMP, is evaluated both in simulation and real experiments, showing promising results in typical industrial automation tasks like car surface polishing.

### [Robotic Sim-To-Real Transfer for Long-Horizon Pick-And-Place Tasks in the Robotic Sim2Real Competition]()

This paper presents a fully autonomous robotic system that performs sim-to-real transfer in complex long-horizon tasks involving navigation, recognition, grasping, and stacking in an environment with multiple obstacles. The key feature of the system is the ability to overcome typical sensing and actuation discrepancies during sim-to-real transfer and to achieve consistent performance without any algorithmic modifications. To accomplish this, a lightweight noise-resistant visual perception system and a nonlinearity-robust servo system are adopted. We conduct a series of tests in both simulated and real-world environments. The visual perception system achieves the speed of 11 ms per frame due to its lightweight nature, and the servo system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with the proposed controller. Both exhibit high consistency during sim-to-real transfer. Our robotic system took first place in the mineral searching task of the Robotic Sim2Real Challenge hosted at ICRA 2024. The simulator is available from the competition committee at https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/ICRA2024-Sim2Real-RM, and all code and competition videos can be accessed via our GitHub repository at https://github.com/Bob-Eric/rmus2024_solution_ZeroBug.

### [Towards Autonomous Data Annotation and System-Agnostic Robotic Grasping Benchmarking with 3D-Printed Fixtures]()

The interaction of robots with their environment requires robust object-centric perception capabilities, typically achieved using learning-based methods trained on synthetic data. However, real-world deployment demands evaluating these capabilities in relevant environments, often involving extensive manual annotation for a quantitative analysis. Additionally, standardized evaluations for robotic tasks, such as grasping, need reproducible object scene configurations and performance benchmarks. We propose a solution to both problems by temporarily employing 3D-printed components, so-called fixtures, which can be designed for any rigid object. Once the scene is set up and object poses are extracted, the fixtures are removed, leaving the natural scene without any artificial distractions. The presented approach is seemingly applicable for pre-determined configurations of multiple objects, which enables precise re-building of scenes with consistent object-to-object relations. Our suggested annotation procedure achieves strong pose accuracy solely on RGB images without any manual involvement. We evaluate and show the usability of the proposed fixtures for automated real-world data annotation to fine-tune a detector and for benchmarking object pose estimation algorithms for robotic grasping. Code and fixture meshes for 3D printing are available at https://github.com/DLR-RM/fixture_generation.

### [From Instantaneous to Predictive Control: A More Intuitive and Tunable MPC Formulation for Robot Manipulators]()

Model predictive control (MPC) has become increasingly popular for the control of robot manipulators due to its improved performance compared to instantaneous control approaches. However, tuning these controllers remains a significant hurdle. To address this hurdle, we propose a practical MPC formulation which retains the more interpretable tuning parameters of the instantaneous control approach while enhancing performance through a prediction horizon. The formulation is motivated at hand of a simple example, highlighting the practical tuning challenges associated with typical MPC approaches and showing how the proposed formulation alleviates these challenges. Furthermore, the formulation is validated on a surface-following task, illustrating its applicability to industrially relevant scenarios. Although the research is presented in the context of robot manipulator control, we anticipate that the formulation is more broadly applicable.

### [A Control Framework for Accurate Mechanical Impedance Rendering with Series-Elastic Joints in Prosthetic Actuation Applications]()

In addition to lifting up the body during gait, human legs provide stabilizing torques that can be modeled as a spring-damper mechanical impedance. While powered prosthetic leg actuators can also imitate spring-damper be- haviors, the rendered impedance can be quite different from the desired impedance, stemming from unmodeled torques in the transmission (e.g., sliding friction, bearing damping, gear inefficiency, etc.). Moreover, for powered prostheses to mimic human joint impedance, they will need actuators that accurately render a wide range of mechanical impedances in a variety of ground contact conditions, including nearly free-swinging behavior in swing phase and stiff spring-like behavior in stance phase. For series-elastic prosthetic leg actuators, as in Open- Source Leg (OSL), these sudden output inertia changes present a challenge for traditional cascaded impedance control. In this paper we propose a solution based on disturbance observers and full state feedback (FSF) impedance control. With transmission disturbances attenuated, the FSF controller can use pole-zero placement to specify the actuator impedance that couples to the uncertain joint inertia. We validate our control framework on an OSL-like two-actuator dynamometry testbed.

### [Concept and Prototype Development of Adaptive Touch Walking Support Robot for Maximizing Human Physical Potential]()

We propose a new walking support robot concept, "Nimbus Guardian," designed to enhance the mobility of both healthy and frail elderly individuals who can walk independently. The proposed robot differs from traditional walker-type or cane-type aids by offering adaptive, minimal touch support based on the user's walking dynamics. Our goal is to realize versatile touch to the user as a preliminary study for developing the adaptive touch walking support robot. To achieve this, we've established a categorization system for walking support touch, outlining the specific types of assistance required for our robot. Based on these categorization, we've developed a prototype that improves the versatility of touch support (touch point, force, and initiator), adapting to the user's body. Our prototype is equipped to offer multiple touch support parts, adjusting to the user's physique. For versatile touch capabilities, we designed a motion control algorithm that includes a controller which directs the robot's wheel movements according to the chosen support points, and a state machine that provides multiple arm placements and movements. We have experimentally implemented this motion control algorithm in our prototype. Through experiments, we verified the touch versatility and discussed the prototype's utility and potential for further development.

### [Learning and Online Replication of Grasp Forces from Electromyography Signals for Prosthetic Finger Control]()

Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals. The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality of prosthetic fingers.

### [Integrated Motion State Prediction for Sit-To-Stand and Stand-To-Sit Motions Toward Effective Power Assist Control]()

Sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions are important in daily activities. However, elderly individuals often find these motions difficult to perform with declining lower limb strength, which causes a considerable reduction to their quality of life. In this study, a sensing method for controlling robotic assistive devices was proposed. This method utilizes electromyographic measurements and a deep neural network to predict motion initiation, and it estimates the timing of triggering assistive devices. Experimental results indicate that four muscle synergy patterns are required to represent the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions together, with two of them being shared between both movements. Subsequently, a long short-term memory network was designed to forecast these two motions, and the result indicates that the prediction accuracy reached 92.95% +- 0.83% with forecasting time of 300 ms.

### [On Chain Driven, Adaptive, Underactuated Fingers for the Development of Affordable, Robust Humanlike Prosthetic Hands]()

Amputations and limb loss can have detrimental effects on personal well-being. Although prosthetic devices can offer significant benefits helping amputees regain some of the lost dexterity, they often lack the required affordability and durability. Current affordable prosthetic designs have trended towards underactuation which leads to stable grasps but is often characterized by low durability. In this paper, a new chain driven, adaptive, underactuated finger design has been proposed for the development of affordable and highly durable prosthetic hands. The transmission mechanism employed is in the form of a steel roller chain. The finger phalanges are constructed of 3D printed PLA, and finger flexion is produced by pulling the internally routed roller chain that is rerouted using sprockets. In total, six 3D printed PLA sprockets are used for chain routing, with an emphasis on high force transmission. The performance of the proposed chain-driven finger was experimentally validated and compared with an analogous tendon-driven version. The metrics employed for this comparison were longevity, pinch grasp efficiency, force response, and maximum force capability. The chain driven finger was shown to have a higher maximum transmissible force, better long term durability, and no issues related to elongation (such as tendon elongation). The cost to manufacture the chain driven robotic finger is only 91 USD, making it an excellent solution for affordable prostheses.

### [Force Myography Based Torque Estimation in Human Knee and Ankle Joints]()

The online adaptation of exoskeleton control based on muscle activity sensing offers a promising approach to personalizing exoskeleton behavior based on the user’s biosignals. While electromyography (EMG)-based methods have demonstrated improvements in joint torque estimation, EMG sensors require direct skin contact and extensive post-processing. In contrast, force myography (FMG) measures normal forces resulting from changes in muscle volume due to muscle activity. We propose an FMG-based method to estimate knee and ankle joint torques by integrating joint angles and velocities with muscle activity data. We learn a model for joint torque estimation using Gaussian process regression (GPR). The effectiveness of the proposed FMG-based method is validated on isokinetic motions performed by ten participants. The model is compared to a baseline model that uses only joint angle and velocity, as well as a model augmented by EMG data. The results indicate that incorporating FMG into exoskeleton control can improve the estimation of joint torque for the ankle and knee joints in novel task characteristics within a single participant. Although the findings suggest that this approach may not improve the generalizability of estimates between multiple participants, they highlight the need for further research into its potential applications in exoskeleton control.

### [Adaptive Ankle-Foot Prosthesis with Passive Agonist-Antagonist Design]()

The development of prosthetic feet that closely replicate the natural biomechanics of the human foot remains a significant challenge in prosthetics engineering. This paper presents the design and testing of a novel agonist-antagonist architecture for the ankle joint of a passive prosthetic foot featuring an adaptive sole. The ankle mechanism, inspired by the dynamics of the human leg-ankle-foot complex, utilizes compliant elements in an agonist-antagonist configuration to passively achieve an ankle torque close to that of a sound ankle without the need for external actuation. Concurrently, the adaptive sole adjusts its shape in response to different terrains, potentially improving stability and comfort for the user. The theoretical model underlying the proposed design is presented, followed by a preliminary validation through simulations. Finally, a prototype based on the new architecture is tested by a healthy subject using customized walking boots, demonstrating its potential to improve the functional performance of prosthetic feet in diverse environments.

### [V2X-DGW: Domain Generalization for Multi-Agent Perception under Adverse Weather Conditions]()

Current LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) multi-agent perception systems have shown the significant success on 3D object detection. While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the domain gap. In this paper,	we propose a Domain Generalization based approach, named V2X-DGW, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Our research aims to not only maintain favorable multi-agent performance in the clean weather but also promote the performance in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To realize the Domain Generalization, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). To evaluate this research, we add Fog, Rain, Snow conditions on two publicized multi-agent datasets based on physics-based models, resulting in two new datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved significant improvements in the unseen adverse weathers.

### [The Automation of Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Traffic Management Calibration Based on Experimental Platform Data]()

Many countries are developing an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) capability defining an Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) architecture to allow safe UAS services in urban environments (e.g., delivery, inspection, air taxis, etc.). The main considerations are air worthiness, operator certification, air traffic management, C2 Link, detect and avoid (DAA), safety management, and security. In addition, if thousands of simultaneous UAS flights are to be achieved, it is not possible for them to be controlled individually by human operators. This makes it necessary to have a rigorous and safe automation methodology to handle such a number of flights. A lane-based airspace structure has been proposed which reduces the complexity of strategic deconfliction by providing UAS agents with a set of pre-defined airway corridors called lanes. This yields collateral benefits including UAS information privacy, robust contingency handling exploiting the lane structure, as well as improved observability and control of the air space. A robust set of UTM parameters and policies must be determined based on the performance characteristics of the deployed UAS platforms, and a methodology which constitutes a first step toward this end is proposed and demonstrated here. In order to realize this approach, a set of initial experiments have been performed to determine the constraints imposed by the UTM on UAS platform capabilities and vice versa. Initial implementation parameters and policies are defined. The major contribution here is a methodology to calibrate UTM safety parameters (e.g., headway, platform speed) in terms of specific platform models’ operational characteristics. That is, UTM parameters are a function of platform and not some arbitrarily imposed values. Safety uncertainty is then characterized by the calibration method.

### [TS-DETR: Traffic Sign Detection Based on Positive and Negative Sample Augmentation]()

Traffic sign detection plays an essential role in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or self-driving vehicles. Typically, deep neural networks are employed to analyze road scene images captured by an onboard camera. However, due to the significant variation in appearance of different traffic signs, the classification of high similarity patterns is still a challenging task. To address these issues, this paper presents an end-to-end traffic sign detection framework based on DETR. The proposed network incorporates data augmentation and negative sample learning to mitigate the problem of data imbalance and enhance the model recognition capability effectively. An UASPP module (Upsample Atrous Pyramid Pooling) is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and global information. In the experiments, the performance evaluation has demonstrated the improvement of mAP by 3.9% on TT100K and 36.3% on GTSDB compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/chinglun/TS-DETR.

### [A User Based HVAC System Management through Blockchain Technology and Model Predictive Control (I)]()

This paper introduces an innovative approach to designing a user-based Heating, Ventilation, and Air- Conditioning (HVAC) system management connected with the District Energy Management System. By classifying the users into dynamic energy consumption classes to reward energy efficiency and penalize excessive use, users can modify their behavior to pass to a less expensive and more virtuous consumption class. To this aim, a blockchain platform determines the rewards and penalties and, by a K-means clustering algorithm, categorizes users into respective groups. Then, a Class Follower Problem is formulated and solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory network as a predictive model. If the users follow the suggestions proposed by the controller, i.e., the thermostat set-points and the time intervals in which the HVAC system must be switched off or on, the users can be located in a more virtuous consumption class. A case study conducted within an energy district in Bari (Italy) shows how the proposed architectural framework tuned thermal regulation in intelligent buildings while concurrently achieving energy optimization

### [Non-Parametric GNSS Integer Ambiguity Estimation Via Positional Likelihood Field Marginalization]()

In this paper, we propose a non-parametric method for estimating the posterior distribution of GNSS integer ambiguity. Is is difficult to estimate the posterior probability of discrete integer ambiguities directly from carrier phase observations due to the unclear domain definition. We thus introduce the positional likelihood field that accumulates the ambiguity function method values in the positional space and then estimate the integer ambiguity distributions by marginalizing the likelihood over the entire position. Because the positional likelihood field is defined in the positional space, it enables ease of carrier phase likelihood accumulation. In order to correctly estimate the posterior distribution, however, a sufficient density of the samples is required that results in a large computational cost.	The proposed method enables large-scale sampling by taking advantage of GPU parallel processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and robust estimation of integer ambiguity distributions, contributing to improved centimeter-level position estimation accuracy.	In addition, the histograms provided quantitative evidence of events in urban environments where integer ambiguity is not uniquely determined.

### [Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics]()

Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.

### [RMP-YOLO: A Robust Motion Predictor for Partially Observable Scenarios Even If You Only Look Once]()

We introduce RMP-YOLO, a unified framework designed to provide robust motion predictions even with incomplete input data. Our key insight stems from the observation that complete and reliable historical trajectory data plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate motion prediction. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm that prioritizes the reconstruction of intact historical trajectories before feeding them into the prediction modules. Our approach introduces a novel scene tokenization module to enhance the extraction and fusion of spatial and temporal features. Following this, our proposed recovery module reconstructs agents' incomplete historical trajectories by leveraging local map topology and interactions with nearby agents. The reconstructed, clean historical data is then integrated into the downstream prediction modules. Our framework is able to effectively handle missing data of varying lengths and remains robust against observation noise, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our recovery module is compatible with existing prediction models, ensuring seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, and deployment in real-world autonomous vehicles confirms its practical utility. In the 2024 Waymo Motion Prediction Competition, our method, RMP-YOLO, achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing third place. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/ggosjw/RMP-YOLO.

### [Leg Exoskeleton Odometry Using a Limited FOV Depth Sensor]()

For leg exoskeletons to operate effectively in real-world environments, they must be able to perceive and understand the terrain around them. However, unlike other legged robots, exoskeletons face specific constraints on where depth sensors can be mounted due to the presence of a human user. These constraints lead to a limited Field Of View (FOV) and greater sensor motion, making odometry particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a novel odometry algorithm that integrates proprioceptive data from the exoskeleton with point clouds from a depth camera to produce accurate elevation maps despite these limitations. Our method builds on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse kinematic and inertial measurements, while incorporating a tailored iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register new point clouds with the elevation map. Experimental validation with a leg exoskeleton demonstrates that our approach reduces drift and enhances the quality of elevation maps compared to a purely proprioceptive baseline, while also outperforming a more traditional point cloud map-based variant.

### [Improving Monocular Visual-Inertial Initialization with Structureless Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment]()

Monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) has facilitated a wide range of real-time motion tracking applications, thanks to the small size of the sensor suite and low power consumption. To successfully bootstrap VIO algorithms, the initialization module is extremely important. Most initialization methods rely on the reconstruction of 3D visual point clouds. These methods suffer from high computational cost as state vector contains both motion states and 3D feature points. To address this issue, some researchers recently proposed a structureless initialization method, which can solve the initial state without recovering 3D structure. However, this method potentially compromises performance due to the decoupled estimation of rotation and translation, as well as linear constraints. To improve its accuracy, we propose novel structureless visual-inertial bundle adjustment to further refine previous structureless solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our method significantly improves the VIO initialization accuracy, while maintaining real-time performance.

### [ORB-SfMLearner: ORB-Guided Self-Supervised Visual Odometry with Selective Online Adaptation]()

Deep visual odometry, despite extensive research, still faces limitations in accuracy and generalizability that prevent its broader application. To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through the attention weights. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.

### [QVIO2: Quantized MAP-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry]()

Energy-efficient visual-inertial motion tracking on SWAP-constrained edge devices (e.g., drones and AR glasses) is essential but challenging. Our previous work introduced the first-of-its-kind quantized visual-inertial odometry (QVIO), utilizing either raw measurement quantization (zQVIO) or single-bit residual quantization (rQVIO). While QVIO has demonstrated significant data transfer reduction with competitive performance, but it has limitations. Specifically, zQVIO directly quantizes raw measurements into multi-bit values, while requiring the ad-hoc inflation of measurement noise to account for quantization errors. On the other hand, rQVIO is limited to single-bit measurement with a certain accuracy loss. This work introduces QVIO2 to address these issues. The proposed QVIO2 improves data quantization strategies and derives a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) quantized estimator that rigorously handles both multi-bit and single-bit, raw and residual quantized measurements in a unified manner. These improvements lead to more communication-efficient and accurate systems. Additionally, we optimize the communication protocol to further reduce data transfer by eliminating un- necessary transmissions. Extensive numerical and experimental results demonstrate reduced communication requirements and improved accuracy. Compared to the previous QVIO system, zQVIO2 achieves the same accuracy with a 30% reduction in data transfer, while rQVIO2 improves accuracy without increasing data communication. In real-world scenarios, our new zQVIO2 and rQVIO2 have demonstrated nearly no accuracy loss with only 4.6 bits and 3.5 bits of data communication, achieving compression rates of 7× and 9.1×.

### [Is Iteration Worth It? Revisit Its Impact in Sliding-Window VIO]()

Visual-inertial odometry (VIO), which fuses noisy inertial readings and camera measurements to provide 3D motion tracking, is a foundational component in many autonomous applications. With the increasing use of next-generation edge devices (e.g., IoT devices, nano drones, and mobile robotics) that are constrained by limited power, resources, and multi-tasking demands, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy in VIO estimators has become more critical than ever. Historically, state estimation algorithms have been developed using either optimization-based or filtering-based methods, with the key distinction being the ability to relinearize measurements and correct state estimates iteratively. While it has been widely claimed that iterative methods improve accuracy by allowing for the reduction of error through relinearization at a higher computational demand. Conversely, filtering methods are more efficient but may suffer from significant linearization errors. However, these trade-offs have not been thoroughly examined in the context of visual-inertial motion tracking. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on the impact of iterative algorithms in sliding-window VIO. We analyze the relinearization of IMU and camera measurements separately, providing insights into how each affects system performance. By considering key factors such as system observability and measurement processes, we offer a deeper understanding of VIO estimator behavior. Our findings, supported by proof-of-concept real-world tests, provide practical guidelines for balancing accuracy and efficiency, helping practitioners determine when to prioritize iterative methods or simpler filtering approaches while encouraging researchers and engineers to rethink VIO design for optimal resource allocation.

### [EAR-SLAM: Environment-Aware Robust Localization System for Terrestrial-Aerial Bimodal Vehicles]()

Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles (TABVs) have attracted great attention because of their advantages over single-model robots. TABVs can provide superior obstacle avoidance capability (flying mode) and safe mobility with long duration (ground mode), offering enhanced adaptability and flexibility in various challenging environments. However, a robust localization approach becomes the bottleneck to stably applying the TABVs in real-world tasks. In this paper, we present an environment-aware robust localization system specifically designed for passive-wheel-based TABVs, which feature two passive wheels alongside a standard quadrotor. The localization system tightly integrates data from multiple sensors, including a camera, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), encoders, and single-point laser distance sensors. First, we introduce a terrain-aware odometer model that accurately estimates terrain slope and vehicle's velocity by fusing gyroscope, encoder, and single-point laser measurements. Then, we propose an anomaly-aware method that senses anomalous sensors and dynamically adjusts the optimization weights accordingly. By explicitly estimating the environmental conditions, such as ground terrain slopes and visual information qualities, the robot can achieve accurate and robust localization results on the ground. To validate our localization approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various challenging scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of our system for real-world applications.

### [DynaVINS++: Robust Visual-Inertial State Estimator in Dynamic Environments by Adaptive Truncated Least Squares and Stable State Recovery]()

Despite extensive research in robust visual-inertial navigation systems(VINS) in dynamic environments, many approaches remain vulnerable to objects that suddenly start moving, which are referred to as abruptly dynamic objects. In addition, most approaches have considered the effect of dynamic objects only at the feature association level. In this study, we observed that the state estimation diverges when errors from false correspondences owing to moving objects incorrectly propagate into the IMU bias terms. To overcome these problems, we propose a robust VINS framework called DynaVINS++, which employs a) adaptive truncated least square method that adaptively adjusts the truncation range using both feature association and IMU preintegration to effectively minimize the effect of the dynamic objects while reducing the computational cost, and b) stable state recovery with bias consistency check to correct misestimated IMU bias and to prevent the divergence caused by abruptly dynamic objects. As verified in both public and real-world datasets, our approach shows promising performance in dynamic environments, including scenes with abruptly dynamic objects.

### [A Pragmatic Approach to Bi-Directional Impedance Reflection Telemanipulation Control: Design and User Study]()

Force feedback generally increases the effectiveness of execution and sense of embodiment on telemanipulation systems. However, systems with force feedback are vulnerable to time delays, reducing their transparency and stability. In this paper, we implement a bi-directional impedance reflection controller, a concept that was presented already in 1989 by Blake Hannaford [1] but was never fully implemented. In this method, the simplified impedances of the operator and the environment are estimated and reflected back to the remote robot and haptic interface, respectively. A trajectory predictor is added to compensate for the delayed motion. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the system in a user study, comparing it to a system with a classical bilateral impedance controller with passivity layers. Three time delay groups (0, 10, and 20 ms one-way delay) of 10 participants each executed different tasks with both controllers. The results show that the bi-directional impedance reflection controller performs significantly better in the 10 ms and 20 ms time delay groups, in terms of task performance, user experience and sense of embodiment. We conclude that this study is the first to show that bi-directional impedance reflection is robust to time delays of at least 20 ms.

### [3D Whole-Body Pose Estimation Using Graph High-Resolution Network for Humanoid Robot Teleoperation]()

In the realm of robotics, teleoperation plays a pivotal role in performing high-risk or intricate tasks, and obtaining precise 3D whole-body pose is crucial for this purpose. Traditional two-stage methods have limitations in estimating different body parts, leading to complex systems and higher estimation errors. In order to address these issues,the paper introduces a novel framework called Graph High-Resolution Network(GraphHRNet) for accurate 3D whole-body pose estimation, which is essential for the teleoperation of humanoid robots. GraphHRNet effectively captures global structural information and local details by integrating a High-Resolution Module and a Multi-branch Regression Module. The High-Resolution Module utilizes an enhanced graph convolution kernel to fuse multi-scale features, capturing global information, while the Multi-branch Regression Module focuses on refining and predicting accurate 3D coordinates for intricate body parts such as hands and face. Experimental results on the H3WB dataset demonstrate that GraphHRNet surpasses state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods in 3D whole-body pose estimation , significantly improving performance. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential application of this approach in a teleoperation system for humanoid robots, providing an intuitive and high-fidelity solution for remotely executing complex tasks. The code have been publicly available at https://github.com/Z-mingyu/GraphHRNet.git

### [Towards Real-Time Generation of Delay-Compensated Video Feeds for Outdoor Mobile Robot Teleoperation]()

Teleoperation is an important technology to enable supervisors to control agricultural robots remotely. However, environmental factors in dense crop rows and limitations in network infrastructure hinder the reliability of data streamed to teleoperators. These issues result in delayed and variable frame rate video feeds that often deviate significantly from the robot's actual viewpoint. We propose a modular learning-based vision pipeline to generate delay-compensated images in real-time for supervisors. Our extensive offline evaluations demonstrate that our method generates more accurate images compared to state-of-the-art approaches in our setting. Additionally, ours is one of the few works to evaluate a delay-compensation method in outdoor field environments with complex terrain on data from a real robot in real-time. Resulting videos and code are provided at https://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/comp-teleop.

### [ForceMimic: Force-Centric Imitation Learning with Force-Motion Capture System for Contact-Rich Manipulation]()

In most contact-rich manipulation tasks, humans apply time-varying forces to the target object, compensating for inaccuracies in the vision-guided hand trajectory. However, current robot learning algorithms primarily focus on trajectory-based policy, with limited attention given to learning force-related skills. To address this limitation, we introduce ForceMimic, a force-centric robot learning system, providing a natural, force-aware and robot-free robotic demonstration collection system, along with a hybrid force-motion imitation learning algorithm for robust contact-rich manipulation. Using the proposed ForceCapture system, an operator can peel a zucchini in 5 minutes, while force-feedback teleoperation takes over 13 minutes and struggles with task completion. With the collected data, we propose HybridIL to train a force-centric imitation learning model, equipped with hybrid force-position control primitive to fit the predicted wrench-position parameters during robot execution. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the model to learn a more robust policy under the contact-rich task of vegetable peeling, increasing the success rates by 54.5% relatively compared to state-of-the-art pure-vision-based imitation learning. Hardware, code, data and more results can be found on the project website at https://forcemimic.github.io.

### [How to Train Your Robots? the Impact of Demonstration Modality on Imitation Learning]()

Imitation learning is a promising approach for learning robot policies with user-provided data. The way demonstrations are provided, i.e., demonstration modality, influences the quality of the data. While existing research shows that kinesthetic teaching (physically guiding the robot) is preferred by users for the intuitiveness and ease of use, the majority of existing manipulation datasets were collected through teleoperation via a VR controller or spacemouse. In this work, we investigate how different demonstration modalities impact downstream learning performance as well as user experience. Specifically, we compare low-cost demonstration modalities including kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation with a VR controller, and teleoperation with a spacemouse controller. We experiment with three table-top manipulation tasks with different motion constraints. We evaluate and compare imitation learning performance using data from different demonstration modalities, and collected subjective feedback on user experience. Our results show that kinesthetic teaching is rated the most intuitive for controlling the robot and provides cleanest data for best downstream learning performance. However, it is not preferred as the way for large-scale data collection due to the physical load. Based on such insight, we propose a simple data collection scheme that relies on a small number of kinesthetic demonstrations mixed with data collected through teleoperation to achieve the best overall learning performance while maintaining low data-collection effort.

### [The Impact of Stress and Workload on Human Performance in Robot Teleoperation Tasks]()

Advances in robot teleoperation have enabled groundbreaking innovations in many fields, such as space exploration, healthcare, and disaster relief. The human operator's performance plays a key role in the success of any teleoperation task, with prior evidence suggesting that operator stress and workload can impact task performance. As robot teleoperation is currently deployed in safety-critical domains, it is essential to analyze how different stress and workload levels impact the operator. We are unaware of any prior work investigating how both stress and workload impact teleoperation performance. We conducted a novel study (n=24) to jointly manipulate users' stress and workload and analyze the user's performance through objective and subjective measures. Our results indicate that, as stress increased, over 70% of our participants performed better up to a moderate level of stress; yet, the majority of participants performed worse as the workload increased. Importantly, our experimental design elucidated that stress and workload have related yet distinct impacts on task performance, with workload mediating the effects of distress on performance (p<.05).

### [Adaptive User Interface with Parallel Neural Networks for Robot Teleoperation]()

In recent years, human-robot interaction (HRI) has become an increasingly important field of research. The human experience during HRI tasks like teleoperation or turn-taking largely depends on the interface design between the robot and the user. Designing an intuitive user interface (UI) between an arbitrary M-dimensional input device and an N-degree of freedom (DOF) robot remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel UI design approach named the Parallel Neural Networks Adaptive User Interface (PNNUI). PNNUI utilizes two parallel neural networks to learn and then improve the teleoperation performance of users by minimizing task completion time and maximizing motion smoothness. Our method is designed to learn an unintuitive input-output map between user interface hardware and the robot by minimizing task completion time in an offline unsupervised learning scheme based on Neural Networks (NNs) and Genetic Algorithms. Secondly, PNNUI minimizes teleoperation jerk online by adapting the weights of a parallel neural network. We experimentally evaluated the resulting UI for teleoperating a 3-DOF nonholonomic robot through a conventional joystick with three inputs. Twenty human subjects operated the robot along an obstacle course in several conditions. The statistical analysis of the user trial data shows that PNNUI improves the human experience in robot teleoperation by maximizing smoothness while maintaining the completion time of the offline learning scheme. Furthermore, the abstract nature of our formulation enables the customization of performance measures, which extends its applicability to other interface devices and HRI tasks, particularly those that are not intuitive to start with.

### [Hierarchical Visual Policy Learning for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation in Densely Cluttered Scenes]()

In this work, we focus on addressing the long-horizon packing tasks in densely cluttered scenes. Such tasks require policies to effectively manage severe occlusions among objects and continually produce precise actions based on visual observations. We propose a vision-based Hierarchical policy for Cluttered-scene Long-horizon Manipulation (HCLM). It employs a high-level policy and three options to select and instantiate three parameterized action primitives: push, pick, and place. We first train the two-stream pick and place options by behavior cloning (BC). Subsequently, we use hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to train the high-level policy and push option. During HRL, we propose a Spatially Extended Q-update (SEQ) to augment the updates for the push option and a Two-Stage Update Scheme (TSUS) to alleviate the non-stationary transition problem in updating the high-level policy. We demonstrate that HCLM significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and efficiency in diverse tasks both in simulation and real world. The ablation studies also validate the key roles of SEQ and TSUS in HRL.

### [AERAS: Adaptive Experience Replay with Attention-Based Sequence Embedding for Improved Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning]()

Multi-agent systems in non-stationary environments face challenges due to rapidly changing dynamics, leading to quick obsolescence of experiences in the replay buffer. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Experience Replay with Attention-Based Sequence Embedding (AERAS) framework, which integrates sequence embedding with an attention mechanism to prioritize experiences based on their relevance. By assigning adaptive weights, AERAS emphasizes relevant experiences while diminishing the impact of outdated ones, enhancing efficiency and learning performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Evaluations on the StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football environments show that AERAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving faster convergence and higher win rates. Ablation studies confirm the essential roles of sequence embedding and attention mechanisms in boosting AERAS's robustness and adaptability, underscoring its effectiveness in managing non-stationary environments within multi-agent systems.

### [Multi-Type Preference Learning: Empowering Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Equal Preferences]()

Preference-Based reinforcement learning (PBRL) learns directly from the preferences of human teachers regarding agent behaviors without needing meticulously designed reward functions. However, existing PBRL methods often learn primarily from explicit preferences, neglecting the possibility that teachers may choose equal preferences. This neglect may hinder the understanding of the agent regarding the task perspective of the teacher, leading to the loss of important information. To address this issue, we introduce the Equal Preference Learning Task, which optimizes the neural network by promoting similar reward predictions when the behaviors of two agents are labeled as equal preferences. Building on this task, we propose a novel PBRL method, Multi-Type Preference Learning (MTPL), which allows simultaneous learning from equal preferences while leveraging existing methods for learning from explicit preferences. To validate our approach, we design experiments applying MTPL to four existing state-of-the-art baselines across ten locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. The experimental results indicate that simultaneous learning from both equal and explicit preferences enables the PBRL method to more comprehensively understand the feedback from teachers, thereby enhancing feedback efficiency.

### [Neural Lyapunov Function Approximation with Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning]()

Control Lyapunov functions are traditionally used to design a controller which ensures convergence to a desired state, yet deriving these functions for nonlinear systems remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel, sample-efficient method for neural approximation of nonlinear Lyapunov functions, leveraging self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance training data generation, particularly for inaccurately represented regions of the state space. The proposed approach employs a data-driven World Model to train Lyapunov functions from off-policy trajectories. The method is validated on both standard and goal-conditioned robotic tasks, demonstrating faster convergence and higher approximation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art neural Lyapunov approximation baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/CAV-Research-Lab/SACLA.git

### [SuPLE: Robot Learning with Lyapunov Rewards]()

The reward function is an essential component in robot learning. Reward directly affects the sample and computational complexity of learning, and the quality of a solution. The design of informative rewards requires domain knowledge, which is not always available. We use the properties of the dynamics to produce system-appropriate reward without adding external assumptions. Specifically, we explore an approach to utilize the Lyapunov exponents of the system dynamics to generate a system-immanent reward. We demonstrate that the Sum of the Positive Lyapunov Exponents (SuPLE) is a strong candidate for the design of such a reward. We develop a computational framework for the derivation of this reward, and demonstrate its effectiveness on classical benchmarks for sample-based stabilization of various dynamical systems. It eliminates the need to start the training trajectories at arbitrary states, also known as auxiliary exploration. While the latter is a common practice in simulated robot learning, it is unpractical to consider to use it in real robotic systems, since they typically start from natural rest states such as a pendulum at the bottom, a robot on the ground, etc. and can not be easily initialized at arbitrary states. Comparing the performance of SuPLE to commonly-used reward functions, we observe that the latter fail to find a solution without auxiliary exploration, even for the task of swinging up the double pendulum and keeping it stable at the upright position, a prototypical scenario for multi- linked robots. SuPLE-induced rewards for robot learning offer a novel route for effective robot learning in typical as opposed to highly specialized or fine-tuned scenarios. Our code is publicly available for reproducibility and further research.

### [SpeedTuning: Speeding up Policy Execution with Lightweight Reinforcement Learning]()

While learned robotic policies hold promise for advancing generalizable manipulation, their practical deployment is often hindered by suboptimal execution speeds. Imitation learning policies are inherently limited by hardware constraints and the speed of the operator during data collection. In addition, there are no established methods for accelerating policies learned via imitation, and the empirical relationship between execution speed and task success remains underexplored. To address these issues, we introduce SpeedTuning, a reinforcement learning framework specifically designed to enhance the speed of manipulation policies. SpeedTuning learns to predict the optimal execution speed for actions, thereby complementing a base policy without necessitating additional data collection. We provide empirical evidence that SpeedTuning achieves substantial improvements in execution speed, exceeding 2.4x speed-up, while preserving an adequate success rate compared to both the original task policy and straightforward speed-up methods such as linear interpolation at a fixed speed. We evaluate our approach across a diverse set of dynamic and precise tasks, including pouring, throwing, and picking, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. Videos and code are available at https://github.com/DaivdYuan/SpeedTuning

### [Simplifying Reward Design in Complex Robotics: Average-Reward Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning]()

This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the control challenges of underactuated systems, focusing on the swing-up and stabilisation tasks on the double pendulum system. We propose the Average-Reward Entropy Advantage Policy Optimisation (AR-EAPO), a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that integrates the strengths of the average-reward RL and the maximum entropy RL (MaxEnt RL). The average reward criterion allows the use of a simple reward function by naturally promoting the long-term goals, at the same time MaxEnt RL encourages the robustness of the policy.	We validate our approach through simulations, consistently outperforming standard RL baselines and traditional control methods. Also, we provide preliminary test results on real double pendulum hardware. Additional experiments on MuJoCo environments further demonstrate AR-EAPO's efficacy on general continuous control tasks. This work underscores the potential of the average-reward criterion in simplifying control design while achieving superior results.

### [Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Non-Prehensile Manipulation]()

Manipulating objects without grasping them facilitates complex tasks, known as non-prehensile manipulation. Most previous methods are limited to learning a single skill to manipulate objects with primitive shapes, and are unserviceable for flexible object manipulation that requires a combination of multiple skills. We explore skill-unconstrained non-prehensile manipulation, and propose a Multi-stage Reinforcement Learning for Non-prehensile Manipulation (MRLNM), which calculates a intermediate state between the initial and goal states and divides the task into multiple stages for sequential learning. At each stage, the policy takes the desired 6-DOF object pose as the goal, and proposes a spatially-continuous action, allowing the robot to explore arbitrary skills to accomplish the task. To handle objects with different shapes, we propose a State-Goal Fusion Representation (SGF-Representation) to represent observations and goals as point clouds with motion, which improves the policy's perception of scene layout and task goal. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a Spatially-Reachable Distance Metric (SR-Distance) to approximately measure the shortest distance between two points without intersecting the scene. We evaluate MRLNM on an occluded grasping task which aims to grasp the object in initially occluded configurations. MRLNM demonstrates strong generalization to unseen objects with shapes outside the training distribution and can be transferred to the real world with zero-shot transfer, achieving a 95% success rate.

### [Points2Plans: From Point Clouds to Long-Horizon Plans with Composable Relational Dynamics]()

We present Points2Plans, a framework for composable planning with a relational dynamics model that enables robots to solve long-horizon manipulation tasks from partial-view point clouds. Given a language instruction and a point cloud of the scene, our framework initiates a hierarchical planning procedure, whereby a language model generates a high-level plan and a sampling-based planner produces constraint-satisfying continuous parameters for manipulation primitives sequenced according to the high-level plan. Key to our approach is the use of a relational dynamics model as a unifying interface between the continuous and symbolic representations of states and actions, thus facilitating language-driven planning from high-dimensional perceptual input such as point clouds. Whereas previous relational dynamics models require training on datasets of multi-step manipulation scenarios that align with the intended test scenarios, Points2Plans uses only single-step simulated training data while generalizing zero-shot to a variable number of steps during real-world evaluations. We evaluate our approach on tasks involving geometric reasoning, multi-object interactions, and occluded object reasoning in both simulated and real-world settings. Results demonstrate that Points2Plans offers strong generalization to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world, where it solves over 85% of evaluated tasks while the next best baseline solves only 50%.

### [Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical In-Context Reinforcement Learning and Hindsight Modular Reflections for Task Planning with LLMs]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in various language tasks, making them promising candidates for decision-making in robotics. Inspired by Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), we propose Retrieval-Augmented in-context reinforcement Learning (RAHL), a novel framework that decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks using an LLM-based high-level policy, in which a complex task is decomposed into sub-tasks by a high-level policy on-the-fly. The sub-tasks, defined by goals, are assigned to the low-level policy to complete. To improve the agent's performance in multi-episode execution, we propose Hindsight Modular Reflection (HMR), where, instead of reflecting on the full trajectory, we let the agent reflect on shorter sub-trajectories to improve reflection efficiency. We evaluate the decision-making ability of the proposed RAHL in three benchmark environments--ALFWorld, Webshop, and HotpotQA. Results show that RAHL can achieve 9%, 42%, and 10% performance improvement in 5 episodes of execution over strong baselines. Furthermore, we also implemented RAHL on the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot. The experiment shows that the robot is able to scan the environment, find doorways, and navigate to new rooms controlled by the LLM policy.

### [Automatic Behavior Tree Expansion with LLMs for Robotic Manipulation]()

Robotic systems for manipulation tasks are increasingly expected to be easy to configure for new tasks or unpredictable environments, while keeping a transparent policy that is readable and verifiable by humans. We propose the method BEhavior TRee eXPansion with Large Language Models (ours) to dynamically and automatically expand and configure Behavior Trees as policies for robot control. The method utilizes an LLM to resolve errors outside the task planner's capabilities, both during planning and execution. We show that the method is able to solve a variety of tasks and failures and permanently update the policy to handle similar problems in the future.

### [LLM-As-BT-Planner: Leveraging LLMs for Behavior Tree Generation in Robot Task Planning]()

Robotic assembly tasks remain an open challenge due to their long horizon nature and complex part relations. Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

### [Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems Via Reinforcement Learning with LLM-Based Planner and Graph-Based Policy]()

Multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown great potential in executing complex tasks, but coordination and safety remain significant challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environ ments. To address these challenges, we propose LGC-MARL, a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collab oration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC MARL in completing various complex tasks.

### [A Black-Box Physics-Informed Estimator Based on Gaussian Process Regression for Robot Inverse Dynamics Identification]()

Learning the inverse dynamics of robots directly from data, adopting a black-box approach, is interesting for several real-world scenarios where limited knowledge about the system is available. In this paper, we propose a black-box model based on Gaussian Process (GP) Regression for the identification of the inverse dynamics of robotic manipulators. The proposed model relies on a novel multidimensional kernel, called Lagrangian Inspired Polynomial (LIP) kernel. The LIP kernel is based on two main ideas. First, instead of directly modeling the inverse dynamics components, we model as GPs the kinetic and potential energy of the system. The GP prior on the inverse dynamics components is derived from those on the energies by applying the properties of GPs under linear operators. Second, as regards the energy prior definition, we prove a polynomial structure of the kinetic and potential energy, and we derive a polynomial kernel that encodes this property. As a consequence, the proposed model allows also to estimate the kinetic and potential energy without requiring any label on these quantities. Results on simulation and on two real robotic manipulators, namely a 7 DOF Franka Emika Pa

### [Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting]()

In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### [Causal Contrastive Learning with Data Augmentations for Imitation-Based Planning]()

Motion planning is a difficult task, especially when generating feasible future trajectories in complex and interactive scenarios. While recent advancements in imitation-based planning have shown significant progress, this approach often encounters causal confusion in dynamic traffic environments. This confusion will cause the planner to incorrectly associate certain actions with outcomes, leading to suboptimal or unsafe plans. To address this, we introduce a novel framework called C2L, which improves the planner’s latent Causal understanding by incorporating Contrastive Learning and counterfactual data augmentation. Additionally, we propose a shortcut eliminator to extract copycat-free features from history states, reducing the impact of temporal spurious correlations. We validate our method on the nuPlan and interPlan benchmarks, with extensive experiments demonstrating that C2L delivers highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [Learning Multiple Probabilistic Decisions from Latent World Model in Autonomous Driving]()

The autoregressive world model exhibits robust generalization capabilities in vectorized scene understanding but encounters difﬁculties in deriving actions due to insufﬁcient uncertainty modeling and self-delusion. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of deriving decisions from an autoregressive world model by addressing these challenges through the formulation of multiple probabilistic hypotheses. We propose LatentDriver, a framework models the environment’s next states and the ego vehicle’s possible actions as a mixture distribution, from which a deterministic control signal is then derived. By incorporating mixture modeling, the stochastic nature of decision-making is captured. Additionally, the self-delusion problem is mitigated by providing intermediate actions sampled from a distribution to the world model. Experimental results on the recently released close-loop benchmark Waymax demonstrate that LatentDriver surpasses state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods, achieving expert-level performance. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/Sephirex-X/LatentDriver.

### [Autonomous Wheel Loader Navigation Using Goal-Conditioned Actor-Critic MPC]()

This paper proposes a novel control method for an autonomous wheel loader, enabling time-efficient navigation to an arbitrary goal pose. Unlike prior works which combine high-level trajectory planners with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we directly enhance the planning capabilities of MPC by incorporating a cost function derived from Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we first train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then transfer the learned planning knowledge to an MPC by incorporating the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization. We also deploy our method on a real-world wheel loader, where we demonstrate successful navigation in various scenarios.

### [Unlock the Power of Unlabeled Data in Language Driving Model]()

Recent Vision-based Large Language Models (VisionLLMs) for autonomous driving have seen rapid advancements. However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.

### [CAFE-AD: Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving]()

Imitation learning based planning tasks on the nuPlan dataset have gained great interest due to their potential to generate human-like driving behaviors. However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD, on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.

### [Beyond Simulation: Benchmarking World Models for Planning and Causality in Autonomous Driving]()

World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world models under these new metrics.

### [Enhancing Repeatability and Reliability of Accelerated Risk Assessment in Robot Testing]()

Risk assessment of a robot in controlled environments, such as laboratories and proving grounds, is a common means to assess, certify, validate, verify, and characterize the robots' safety performance before, during, and even after their commercialization in the real-world. A standard testing program that acquires the risk estimate is expected to be (i) repeatable, such that it obtains similar risk assessments of the same testing subject among multiple trials or attempts with the similar testing effort by different stakeholders, and (ii) reliable against a variety of testing subjects produced by different vendors and manufacturers. Both repeatability and reliability are fundamental and crucial for a testing algorithm's validity, fairness, and practical feasibility, especially for standardization. However, these properties are rarely satisfied or ensured, especially as the subject robots become more complex, uncertain, and varied. This issue was present in traditional risk assessments through Monte-Carlo sampling, and remains a bottleneck for the recent accelerated risk assessment methods, primarily those using importance sampling. This study aims to enhance existing accelerated testing frameworks by proposing a new algorithm that provably integrates repeatability and reliability with the already established formality and efficiency. It also features demonstrations assessing the risk of instability from frontal impacts, initiated by push-over disturbances on a controlled inverted pendulum and a 7-DoF planar bipedal robot Rabbit managed by various control algorithms.

### [Learning-Based Bayesian Inference for Testing of Autonomous Systems]()

For the safe operation of robotic systems, it is important to accurately understand its failure modes using prior testing. Hardware testing of robotic infrastructure is known to be slow and costly. Instead, failure prediction in simulation can help to analyze the system before deployment. Conventionally, large-scale naive Monte Carlo simulations are used for testing; however, this method is only suitable for testing average system performance. For safety-critical systems, worst-case performance is more crucial as failures are often rare events, and the size of test batches increases substantially as failures become more rare. Rare-event sampling methods can be helpful; however, they exhibit slow convergence and cannot handle constraints. This research introduces a novel sampling-based testing framework for autonomous systems which bridges these gaps by utilizing a discretized gradient-based second-order Langevin algorithm combined with learning-based techniques for constrained sampling of failure modes. Our method can predict more diverse failures by exploring the search space efficiently and ensures feasibility with respect to temporal and implicit constraints. We demonstrate the use of our testing methodology on two categories of testing problems, via simulations and hardware experiments. Our method discovers up to 2X failures compared to naive Random Walk sampling, with only half of the sample size.

### [Foundation Models for Rapid Autonomy Validation]()

We are motivated by the problem of autonomous vehicle performance validation. A key challenge is that an autonomous vehicle requires testing in every kind of driving scenario it could encounter, including rare events, to provide a strong case for safety and show there is no edge-case pathological behavior. Autonomous vehicle companies rely on potentially millions of miles driven in realistic simulation to expose the driving stack to enough miles to estimate rates and severity of collisions. To address scalability and coverage, we propose the use of a behavior foundation model, specifically a masked autoencoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct driving scenarios. We leverage the foundation model in two complementary ways: we (i) use the learned embedding space to group qualitatively similar scenarios together and (ii) fine-tune the model to label scenario difficulty based on the likelihood of a collision upon simulation. We use the difficulty scoring as importance weighting for the groups of scenarios. The result is an approach which can more rapidly estimate the rates and severity of collisions by prioritizing hard scenarios while ensuring exposure to every kind of driving scenario.

### [The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-Based Balancing, Flips, and Articulated Driving]()

The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle robot designed as a testbed for learning-based control. It is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular learning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for tuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can track higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the robot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class of robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based control algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in the video of our experiments.

### [The Impact of Sensor Faults on Connected Autonomous Vehicle Localization]()

Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can provide benefits over individual vehicles for precise navigation, especially in GNSS-denied environments. CAV collaboration can enhance estimation accuracy, but the safety of collaborative localization in the presence of undetected sensor faults remains underexplored. This paper introduces an integrity monitoring method for CAV collaborative localization in both centralized and decentralized implementations. Fault models for landmark and relative measurements are described, and the probability of hazardous misleading information, or integrity risk, is derived. Simulation and experimental results for notional two-CAV scenarios indicate that collaborative localization reduces integrity risk and enhances navigation safety.

### [Realistic Extreme Behavior Generation for Improved AV Testing]()

This work introduces a framework to diagnose the strengths and shortcomings of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) collision avoidance technology with synthetic yet realistic potential collision scenarios adapted from real-world, collision-free data. Our framework generates counterfactual collisions with diverse crash properties, e.g., crash angle and velocity, between an adversary and a target vehicle by adding perturbations to the adversary's predicted trajectory from a learned AV behavior model. Our main contribution is to ground these adversarial perturbations in realistic behavior as defined through the lens of data-alignment in the behavior model's parameter space. Then, we cluster these synthetic counterfactuals to identify plausible and representative collision scenarios to form the basis of a test suite for downstream AV system evaluation. We demonstrate our framework using two state-of-the-art behavior prediction models as sources of realistic adversarial perturbations, and show that our scenario clustering evokes interpretable failure modes from a baseline AV policy under evaluation.

### [Limits of Specifiability for Sensor-Based Robotic Planning Tasks]()

There is now a large body of techniques, many based on formal methods, for describing and realizing complex robotics tasks, including those involving a variety of rich goals and time-extended behavior. This paper explores the limits of what sorts of tasks are specifiable, examining how the precise grounding of specifications, that is, whether the specification is given in terms of the robot's states, its actions and observations, its knowledge, or some other information, is crucial to whether a given task can be specified. While prior work included some description of particular choices for this grounding, our contribution treats this aspect as a first-class citizen: we introduce notation to deal with a large class of problems, and examine how the grounding affects what tasks can be posed. The results demonstrate that certain classes of tasks are specifiable under different combinations of groundings.

### [Human-Agent Joint Learning for Efficient Robot Manipulation Skill Acquisition]()

Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers the potential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However, teleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via a teleoperation system presents inherent challenges due to the task's high dimensionality, complexity of motion, and differences between physiological structures. In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning between human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share control of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies the data collection process and facilitating simultaneous human demonstration collection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistive agent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are required, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It also allows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-off between manual and automated control. We conducted experiments in both simulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studies and quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system could enhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptation while ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstream tasks.

### [To Ask or Not to Ask: Human-In-The-Loop Contextual Bandits with Applications in Robot-Assisted Feeding]()

Robot-assisted bite acquisition involves picking up food items with varying shapes, compliance, sizes, and textures. Fully autonomous strategies may not generalize efficiently across this diversity. We propose leveraging feedback from the care recipient when encountering novel food items. However, frequent queries impose a workload on the user. We formulate human-in-the-loop bite acquisition within a contextual bandit framework and introduce LinUCB-QG, a method that selectively asks for help using a predictive model of querying workload based on query types and timings. This model is trained on data collected in an online study involving 14 participants with mobility limitations, 3 occupational therapists simulating physical limitations, and 89 participants without limitations. We demonstrate that our method better balances task performance and querying workload compared to autonomous and always-querying baselines and adjusts its querying behavior to account for higher workload in users with mobility limitations. This is validated through experiments in a simulated food dataset and a user study with 19 participants, including one with severe mobility limitations.

### [Point and Go: Intuitive Reference Frame Reallocation in Mode Switching for Assistive Robotics]()

Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive 'point and go' translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced completion times by 31%, pauses by 41%, and mode switches by 33%, while receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

### [RoboCrowd: Scaling Robot Data Collection through Crowdsourcing]()

In recent years, imitation learning from large-scale human demonstrations has emerged as a promising paradigm for training robot policies. However, the burden of collecting large quantities of human demonstrations is significant in terms of collection time and the need for access to expert operators. We introduce a new data collection paradigm, RoboCrowd, which distributes the workload by utilizing crowdsourcing principles and incentive design. RoboCrowd helps enable scalable data collection and facilitates more efficient learning of robot policies. We build RoboCrowd on top of ALOHA (Zhao et al. 2023)---a bimanual platform that supports data collection via puppeteering---to explore the design space for crowdsourcing in-person demonstrations in a public environment. We propose three classes of incentive mechanisms to appeal to users' varying sources of motivation for interacting with the system: material rewards, intrinsic interest, and social comparison. We instantiate these incentives through tasks that include physical rewards, engaging or challenging manipulations, as well as gamification elements such as a leaderboard. We conduct a large-scale, two-week field experiment in which the platform is situated in a university cafe. We observe significant engagement with the system---over 200 individuals independently volunteered to provide a total of over 800 interaction episodes. Our findings validate the proposed incentives as mechanisms for shaping users' data quantity and quality. Further, we demonstrate that the crowdsourced data can serve as useful pre-training data for policies fine-tuned on expert demonstrations---boosting performance up to 20% compared to when this data is not available. These results suggest the potential for RoboCrowd to reduce the burden of robot data collection by carefully implementing crowdsourcing and incentive design principles.

### [How Sound-Based Robot Communication Impacts Perceptions of Robotic Failure]()

One challenge in human-robot interaction is selecting communication methods that fit a given robotic system and avoid overpromising. For example, verbal speech provides a clear and easy-to-understand communication method, but can inflate expectations of robot abilities. Is verbal speech the ultimate option? Might other tactics provide similar advantages with fewer downsides? The presented work focuses on addressing these important questions by 1) quantifying any inflated opinions of robots that use verbal speech and 2) gathering perspectives on alternative nonverbal sound-based communication tactics (as a means to potentially shrink gaps between expected and actual robot performance). We conducted a within-subjects online study that varied robot communication modes in videos of successful and unsuccessful mock tasks by a modern commercial robot. Assessments of robot competence and trust after an observed robot failure were higher for verbal robots, but we observed less decline in competence and trust ratings due to the failure for a nonverbal robot using character-like sound (compared to a robot using verbal communication). Human-robot interaction practitioners can use our results to design effective and robust communication strategies for robots.

### [Obstacle-Avoidant Leader Following with a Quadruped Robot]()

Personal mobile robotic assistants are expected to find wide applications in industry and healthcare. For example, people with limited mobility can benefit from robots helping with daily tasks, or construction workers can have robots perform precision monitoring tasks on-site. However, manually steering a robot while in motion requires significant concentration from the operator, especially in tight or crowded spaces. This reduces walking speed, and the constant need for vigilance increases fatigue and, thus, the risk of accidents. This work presents a virtual leash with which a robot can naturally follow an operator. We use a sensor fusion based on a custom-built RF transponder, RGB cameras, and a LiDAR. In addition, we customize a local avoidance planner for legged platforms, which enables us to navigate dynamic and narrow environments. We successfully validate on the ANYmal platform the robustness and performance of our entire pipeline in real-world experiments.

### [Semantic Cross-Pose Correspondence from a Single Example]()

This article focuses on predicting how an object can be transformed to a semantically meaningful pose relative to another object, given only one or few examples. Current pose correspondence methods rely on vast 3D object datasets and do not actively consider semantic information, which limits the objects to which they can be applied. We present a novel method for learning cross-object pose correspondence. rev{The proposed method detects interacting object parts, performs one-shot part correspondence, and uses geometric and visual-semantic features. Given one example of two objects posed relative to each other, the model can learn how to transfer the demonstrated relations to unseen object instances.

### [H2O+: An Improved Framework for Hybrid Offline-And-Online RL with Dynamics Gaps]()

Solving real-world complex tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) without high-fidelity simulation environments or large amounts of offline data can be quite challenging. Online RL agents trained in imperfect simulation environments can suffer from severe sim-to-real issues. Offline RL approaches although bypass the need for simulators, often pose demanding requirements on the size and quality of the offline datasets. The recently emerged hybrid offline-and-online RL provides an attractive framework that enables joint use of limited offline data and imperfect simulator for transferable policy learning. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, called H2O+, which offers great flexibility to bridge various choices of offline and online learning methods, while also accounting for dynamics gaps between the real and simulation environment. Through extensive simulation and real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate superior performance and flexibility of H2O+ over advanced cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms.

### [M2Distill: Multi-Modal Distillation for Lifelong Imitation Learning]()

Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

### [Expert-Enhanced Masked Point Modeling for Point Cloud Self-Supervised Learning]()

Recently, learning-based point cloud analysis has played a crucial role in robotic perception. Masked Point Modeling (MPM), owing to its powerful representational capabilities, has become the mainstream point cloud self-supervised learning method. However, existing MPM-based methods often suffer from the problem of negative transfer, due to the disparity in semantic distribution between upstream data and downstream data. To address this issue, we propose an expert enhancement strategy for existing MPM-based methods. Specifically, we insert a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) layer after each block of the backbone network, which utilizes a multi-branch expert architecture with routers that allocate data of different semantics to the appropriate experts for analysis. During the pre-training phase, our expert-enhanced model not only learns universal 3D representations for the backbone network but also acquires powerful semantic routing capabilities for all expert layers. In the fine-tuning phase, we freeze all backbones and conduct end-to-end fine-tuning solely on our expert layers to adaptively select multiple experts most relevant to the semantics of each downstream data for analysis. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially outperforming baseline (Point-MAE) by 5.16%, 5.86%, and 4.62% in three variants of ScanObjectNN while utilizing only 12% of its trainable parameters. Our code is released at https://github.com/chenchen1104/point_e2mae.

### [3D Dense Captioning Via Prototypical Momentum Distillation]()

3D dense captioning aims to describe the crucial regions in 3D visual scenes in the form of natural language. Recent prevailing approaches achieve promising results by leveraging complicated structures incorporated with large-scale models, which necessitate abundant parameters and pose challenges regarding its practical applications. Besides, with limited training data, 3D dense captioners are often susceptible to overfitting, directly degrading caption generation performance. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements in knowledge distillation, we propose a novel approach termed Prototypical Momentum Distillation (PMD) to prompt the model to generate more detailed captions. PMD incorporates Momentum Distillation (MD) with an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-anchored Clustering (UPC) strategy to transfer knowledge by considering the uncertainty of the teacher knowledge. Specifically, we employ the original captioner as the student model and maintain an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) copy of the captioner as the teacher model to impart knowledge as the auxiliary supervision of the student. To abate the misleading caused by uncertain knowledge, we present an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-anchored Clustering (UPC) strategy to cluster the distilled knowledge according to its confidence. We then transfer the rearranged knowledge from the teacher to guide the training route of the student. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on two widely used benchmark datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that PMD outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmarks with MLE training, highlighting its effectiveness.

### [DUOLINGO: Dynamics Utilization for Online Translation of Actions]()

Robots in the real world experience wear and tear, leading to changing system dynamics. This challenge is particularly exacerbated for non-rigid systems such as soft robots or robotic systems made of meta-materials with hysteresis. This setting results in a challenging problem for most learning-based controllers that typically rely on the assumption that the system dynamics remain fixed over time. In the absence of explicit mechanisms to account for this change in dynamics, learning-based control algorithms show considerable degradation in performance over time. In this work, we consider a particular class of dynamics shift in under-actuated systems, that is localized to the dynamics of the fully actuated robot itself, while independently leaving the dynamics of the environment unchanged. This captures real-world phenomena such as fatigue or hysteresis in robotic systems. In this setting, we propose an efficient algorithm that can account for dynamics shift. Using a simple calibration procedure, we propose a technique for learning a non-linear ``action-translation" model that can capture the localized shift in dynamics. This enables continual learning and transfer despite considerable dynamics shift during the learning process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure on several tasks in simulation, as well as a real-world robotic system - a 4 DoF electrically driven handed shearing auxetic (HSA) platform.

### [DigiForests: A Longitudinal LiDAR Dataset for Forestry Robotics]()

Forests are vital to our ecosystems, acting as carbon sinks, climate stabilizers, biodiversity centers, and wood sources. Due to their scale, monitoring and managing forests takes a lot of work. Forestry robotics offers the potential for enabling efficient and sustainable foresting practices through automation. Despite increasing interest in this field, the scarcity of robotics datasets and benchmarks in forest environments is hampering progress in this domain. In this paper, we present a real-world, longitudinal dataset for forestry robotics that enables the development and comparison of approaches for various relevant applications, ranging from semantic interpretation to estimating traits relevant to forestry management. The dataset consists of multiple recordings of the same plots in a forest in Switzerland during three different growth periods. We recorded the data with a mobile 3D LiDAR scanning setup. Additionally, we provide semantic annotations of trees, shrubs, and ground, instance-level annotations of trees, as well as more fine-grained annotations of tree stems and crowns. Furthermore, we provide reference field measurements of traits relevant to forestry management for a subset of the trees. Together with the data, we also provide open-source baseline panoptic segmentation and tree trait estimation approaches to enable the community to bootstrap further research and simplify comparisons in this domain.

### [Near Time-Optimal Hybrid Motion Planning for Timber Cranes]()

Efficient, collision-free motion planning is essential for automating large-scale manipulators like timber cranes. They come with unique challenges such as hydraulic actuation constraints and passive joints—factors that are seldom addressed by current motion planning methods. This paper introduces a novel approach for time-optimal, collision-free hybrid motion planning for a hydraulically actuated timber crane with passive joints. We enhance the via-point-based stochastic trajectory optimization (VP-STO) algorithm to include pump flow rate constraints and develop a novel collision cost formulation to improve robustness. The effectiveness of the enhanced VP-STO as an optimal single-query global planner is validated by comparison with an informed RRT* algorithm using a time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP). The overall hybrid motion planning is formed by combination with a gradient-based local planner that is designed to follow the global planner's reference and to systematically consider the passive joint dynamics for both collision avoidance and sway damping.

### [An Ultra-Light Seedling Planting Mechanism for Use in Aerial Reforestation]()

This article presents a novel, ultralight tree planting mechanism for use on an aerial vehicle. Current tree planting operations are typically performed manually, and existing automated solutions use large land-based vehicles or excavators which cause significant site damage and are limited to open, clear-cut plots. Our device uses a high-pressure compressed air power system and a novel double-telescoping design to achieve a weight of only 8 kg: well within the payload capacity of medium to large drones. This article describes the functionality and key components of the device and validates its feasibility through experimental testing. We propose this mechanism as a cost-effective, highly scalable solution that avoids ground damage, produces minimal emissions, and can operate equally well on open clear-cut sites as in denser, selectively-harvested forests.

### [Towards Autonomous Wood-Log Grasping with a Forestry Crane: Simulator and Benchmarking]()

Forestry machines operated in forest production environments face challenges when performing manipulation tasks, especially regarding the complicated dynamics of underactuated crane systems and the different sizes of logs to be grasped. This study investigates the feasibility of using reinforcement learning for forestry crane manipulators in grasping and lifting a varying-diameter wood log in a simulation environment. The Mujoco physics engine creates realistic scenarios, including modeling a forestry crane with 8 degrees of freedom from CAD data and wood logs of different sizes. Our results show the successful implementation of a velocity controller for log grasping by deep reinforcement learning using a curriculum strategy. Given the six degrees of freedom (DoF) poses of the wood log, i.e., the 3D Cartesian position and the orientation, the proposed control strategy exhibits a success rate of 96% when grasping logs of different diameters and under random initial configurations of the forestry crane. In addition, reward functions and reinforcement learning baselines are investigated to provide an open-source benchmark for the community in large-scale manipulation tasks. A video with several demonstrations can be seen at https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/d18a/.

### [Designing Experimental Setup Emulating Log-Loader Manipulator and Implementing Anti-Sway Trajectory Planner]()

Forestry machines are not easily accessible for experimentation or demonstration of research results. These mobile robots are massive, very expensive, and require a large outdoor space and permits to operate. These factors hinder conducting experiments on real forestry robots. Thus, it is essential to design experimental setups utilizing easily accessible robots in indoor labs that can effectively replicate the behavior of interest of a forestry machine. We design a setup to resemble a log-loader crane and grapple motions using a Kinova Jaco2 arm by manufacturing a specialized end-effector to attach passively to the Jaco2 arm. Passively attached grapple causes undesirable sway, which is problematic and dangerous in forestry. To address the sway problem, we employ dynamic programming to develop an anti-sway motion planner, and validate its performance for different point-to-point maneuvers in our experimental setup. We also repeat each experiment at least 6 times to ensure the repeatability and reliability of the experiments. The experimental results showcase the excellent sway-damping performance of our planner and also the very good repeatability of our experiments.

### [FRAME: A Modular Framework for Autonomous Map Merging: Advancements in the Field (I)]()

In this article, a novel approach for merging 3-D point cloud maps in the context of egocentric multirobot exploration is presented. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed approach leverages state-of-the-art place recognition and learned descriptors to efficiently detect overlap between maps, eliminating the need for the time-consuming global feature extraction and feature matching process. The estimated overlapping regions are used to calculate a homogeneous rigid transform, which serves as an initial condition for the general iterative closest point (GICP) point cloud registration algorithm to refine the alignment between the maps. The advantages of this approach include faster processing time, improved accuracy, and increased robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through multiple field missions of robot exploration in a variety of different underground environments.

### [Evetac: An Event-Based Optical Tactile Sensor for Robotic Manipulation]()

Optical tactile sensors have recently become popular. They provide high spatial resolution, but struggle to offer fine temporal resolutions. To overcome this shortcoming, we study the idea of replacing the RGB camera with an event-based camera and introduce a new event-based optical tactile sensor called Evetac. Along with hardware design, we develop touch processing algorithms to process its measurements online at 1000 Hz. We devise an efficient algorithm to track the elastomer’s deformation through the imprinted markers despite the sensor’s sparse output. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate Evetac’s capabilities of sensing vibrations up to 498 Hz, reconstructing shear forces, and significantly reducing data rates compared to RGB optical tactile sensors. Moreover, Evetac’s output and the marker tracking provide meaningful features for learning data-driven slip detection and prediction models. The learned models form the basis for a robust and adaptive closed-loop grasp controller capable of handling a wide range of objects. We believe that fast and efficient event-based tactile sensors like Evetac will be essential for bringing human-like manipulation capabilities to robotics.

### [Shape-Space Deformer: Unified Visuo-Tactile Representations for Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Objects]()

Accurate modeling of object deformations is crucial for a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks, where interacting with soft or deformable objects is essential. Current methods struggle to generalize to unseen forces or adapt to new objects, limiting their utility in real-world applications. We propose Shape-Space Deformer, a unified representation for encoding a diverse range of object deformations using template augmentation to achieve robust, fine-grained reconstructions that are resilient to outliers and unwanted artifacts. Our method improves generalization to unseen forces and can rapidly adapt to novel objects, significantly outperforming existing approaches. We perform extensive experiments to test a range of force generalisation settings and evaluate our methods ability to reconstruct unseen deformations, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Our approach is suitable for real-time performance, making it ready for downstream manipulation applications.

### [Depth Estimation through Translucent Surfaces]()

In this paper, we tackle the novel computer vision problem of depth estimation through a translucent barrier. This is an important problem for robotics when manipulating objects through plastic wrapping, or when predicting the depth of items behind a translucent barrier for manipulation. We propose two approaches for providing depth prediction models the ability to see through translucent barriers: removing translucent barriers through image inpainting before passing to standard depth prediction models as input, and directly training depth models with images with translucent barriers. We show that image inpainting allows standard learned monocular and stereo depth estimation models to achieve 3 cm MAE for predicting depth of shelved items behind plastic, whereas training with real images with translucent barriers allows them to achieve centimeter or sub-centimeter MAE. We demonstrate in real robot experiments that depth-aided space estimation allows the robot to place 46% additional items into shelves with translucent barriers. This paper also provides a publicly available dataset of objects occluded by translucent barriers in a tabletop environment and a shelf environment which will allow others to contribute to this novel problem that's critical for many robotic manipulation applications including suction gripping and item packing.

### [Multimodal and Force-Matched Imitation Learning with a See-Through Visuotactile Sensor]()

Contact-rich tasks continue to present many challenges for robotic manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.

### [DotTip: Enhancing Dexterous Robotic Manipulation with a Tactile Fingertip Featuring Curved Perceptual Morphology]()

Tactile sensing technologies enable robots to interact with the environment in increasingly nuanced and dexterous ways. A significant gap in this domain is the absence of curved tactile sensors, which are essential for performing sophisticated manipulation tasks. In this study, we present DotTip, a tactile fingertip featuring a three-dimensional curved perceptual surface that closely mimics human fingertip morphology. A convolutional neural network-based deep learning framework precisely calculates the contact angles and forces from the sensor tactile images, achieving mean errors of 1.56 degrees and 0.28 N, respectively. DotTip's performance is evaluated in real-world tasks, demonstrating its efficacy in tactile servoing, slip prevention, and grasping, along with the more challenging benchmark task of controlling a joystick. These findings demonstrate that DotTip possesses superior 3D tactile sensing capabilities necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulations compared to its flat counterparts.

### [Visual-Tactile Inference of 2.5D Object Shape from Marker Texture]()

Visual-tactile sensing affords abundant capabilities for contact-rich object manipulation tasks including grasping and placing. Here we introduce a shape-from-texture inspired contact shape estimation approach for visual-tactile sensors equipped with visually distinct membrane markers. Under a perspective projection camera model, measurements related to the change in marker separation upon contact are used to recover surface shape. Our approach allows for shape sensing in real time, without requiring network training or complex assumptions related to lighting, sensor geometry or marker placement. Experiments show that the surface contact shape recovered is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with those obtained through the use of photometric stereo, the current state of the art for shape recovery in visual-tactile sensors. Importantly, our approach is applicable to a large family of sensors not equipped with photometric stereo hardware, and also to those with semi-transparent membranes. The recovery of surface shape affords new capabilities to these sensors for robotic applications, such as the estimation of contact and slippage in object manipulation tasks and the use of force matching for kinesthetic teaching using multimodal visual-tactile sensing.

### [STHN: Deep Homography Estimation for UAV Thermal Geo-Localization with Satellite Imagery]()

Accurate geo-localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for outdoor applications including search and rescue operations, power line inspections, and environmental monitoring. The vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals to interference and spoofing necessitates the development of additional robust localization methods for autonomous navigation. Visual Geo-localization (VG), leveraging onboard cameras and reference satellite maps, offers a promising solution for absolute localization. Specifically, Thermal Geo-localization (TG), which relies on image-based matching between thermal imagery with satellite databases, stands out by utilizing infrared cameras for effective nighttime localization. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of current TG approaches, are hindered by dense sampling on satellite maps and geometric noises in thermal query images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STHN, a novel UAV thermal geo-localization approach that employs a coarse-to-fine deep homography estimation method. This method attains reliable thermal geo-localization within a 512-meter radius of the UAV's last known location even with a challenging 11% size ratio between thermal and satellite images, despite the presence of indistinct textures and self-similar patterns. We further show how our research significantly enhances UAV thermal geo-localization performance and robustness against geometric noises under low-visibility conditions in the wild. The code is made publicly available.

### [Vision Transformers for End-To-End Vision-Based Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance]()

We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional vision-based navigation via independent mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to be effective for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all speeds. We assess performance at speeds of 1-7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.

### [DroneDiffusion: Robust Quadrotor Dynamics Learning with Diffusion Models]()

An inherent fragility of quadrotor systems stems from model inaccuracies and external disturbances. These factors hinder performance and compromise the stability of the system, making precise control challenging. Existing model-based approaches either make deterministic assumptions, utilize Gaussian-based representations of uncertainty, or rely on nominal models, all of which often fall short in capturing the complex, multimodal nature of real-world dynamics. This work introduces DroneDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to learn quadrotor dynamics, formulated as a sequence generation task. DroneDiffusion achieves superior generalization to unseen, complex scenarios by capturing the temporal nature of uncertainties and mitigating error propagation. We integrate the learned dynamics with an adaptive controller for trajectory tracking with stability guarantees. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world flights demonstrate the robustness of the framework across a range of scenarios, including unfamiliar flight paths and varying payloads, velocities, and wind disturbances.

### [FlightForge: Advancing UAV Research with Procedural Generation of High-Fidelity Simulation and Integrated Autonomy]()

Robotic simulators play a crucial role in the development and testing of autonomous systems, particularly in the realm of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, existing simulators often lack high-level autonomy, hindering their immediate applicability to complex tasks such as autonomous navigation in unknown environments. This limitation stems from the challenge of integrating realistic physics, photorealistic rendering, and diverse sensor modalities into a single simulation environment. At the same time, the existing photorealistic UAV simulators use mostly hand-crafted environments with limited environment sizes, which prevents the testing of long-range missions. This restricts the usage of existing simulators to only low-level tasks such as control and collision avoidance. To this end, we propose the novel FlightForge UAV open-source simulator. FlightForge offers advanced rendering capabilities, diverse control modalities, and, foremost, procedural generation of environments. Moreover, the simulator is already integrated with a fully autonomous UAV system capable of long-range flights in cluttered unknown environments. The key innovation lies in novel procedural environment generation and seamless integration of high-level autonomy into the simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate superior sensor rendering capability compared to existing simulators, and also the ability of autonomous navigation in almost infinite environments.

### [AIVIO: Closed-Loop, Object-Relative Navigation of UAVs with AI-Aided Visual Inertial Odometry]()

Object-relative mobile robot navigation is essential for a variety of tasks, e.g. autonomous critical infrastructure inspection, but requires the capability to extract semantic information about the objects of interest from raw sensory data. While deep learning-based (DL) methods excel at inferring semantic object information from images, such as class and relative 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose, they are computationally demanding and thus often not suitable for payload constrained mobile robots. In this letter we present a real-time capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for object-relative, closed-loop navigation with a minimal sensor configuration consisting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and RGB camera. Utilizing a DL-based object pose estimator, solely trained on synthetic data and optimized for companion board deployment, the object-relative pose measurements are fused with the IMU data to perform object-relative localization. We conduct multiple real-world experiments to validate the performance of our system for the challenging use case of power pole inspection. An example closed-loop flight is presented in the supplementary video.

### [Unified Incremental Nonlinear Controller for the Transition Control of a Hybrid Dual-Axis Tilting Rotor Quad-Plane]()

Overactuated Tilt Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are renowned for exceptional wind resistance and a broad operational range, which poses complex control challenges due to non-affine dynamics. Traditional solutions employ multi-state switched logic controllers for transitions. Our study introduces a novel unified incremental nonlinear controller for overactuated dual-axis tilting rotor quad-planes, seamlessly managing pitch, roll, and physical actuator commands. The nonlinear control allocation problem is addressed using a sequential quadratic programming iterative optimization algorithm, well-suited for nonlinear actuator effectiveness in thrust vectoring vehicles. The controller design integrates desired roll and pitch angle inputs as an additional degree of freedom during slow airspeed phases. At high airspeed, the roll and pitch angles cannot be chosen freely and are set by the controller. We incorporate an angle of attack protection logic to prevent wing stall and a yaw rate reference model for coordinated turns. Flight tests confirm the controller's effectiveness in transitioning from hovering to forward flight, achieving desired vertical and lateral accelerations, and reverting to hover.

### [Graph2Nav: 3D Object-Relation Graph Generation to Robot Navigation]()

We propose Graph2Nav, a real-time 3D object-relation graph generation framework, for autonomous navigation in the real world. Our framework fully generates and exploits both 3D objects and a rich set of semantic relationships among objects in a 3D layered scene graph, which is applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. It learns to generate 3D semantic relations among objects, by leveraging and advancing state-of-the-art 2D panoptic scene graph works into the 3D world via 3D semantic mapping techniques. This approach avoids previous training data constraint in learning 3D scene graphs directly from 3D data. We conduct experiments to validate the accuracy in locating 3D objects and labeling object-relations in our 3D scene graphs. We also evaluate the impact from Graph2Nav via integration with SayNav, a state-of-the-art planner based on large language models, on an unmanned ground robot to object search tasks in real environments. Our results demonstrate that modeling object relations in our scene graphs improves search efficiency in these navigation tasks.

### [Transferring Visual Knowledge: Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation for Object Navigation across Varying Height Viewpoints]()

The object navigation task requires robots to understand the semantic regularities in their environments. However, existing modular object navigation frameworks rely on instance segmentation models trained at fixed camera height viewpoints, limiting generalization performance and increasing labeling costs for new height viewpoints. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised method that transfers knowledge from a source height to a target height, minimizing the need for additional labels. Our approach introduces three key innovations: i) a projection policy to enhance the teacher model's detection capabilities at the target height, ii) a dynamic weight mechanism that emphasizes high-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce overfitting, and iii) a prototype contrast transferring method to transfer knowledge effectively. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset show our method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques, improving both segmentation accuracy and navigation performance. The code is available at:https://github.com/FreeformRobotics/TransferKnowledge.

### [An Algorithm for Geometric Navigation Planning under Uncertainty Using Terrain Boundary Detection]()

We explore a navigation planning problem under uncertainty for a simple robot with extremely limited sensing. Our robot can turn subject to significant proportional error and move forward. As it moves in an environment with a known terrain map, the robot can detect changes in the terrain at its current position. Given an initial pose and a goal segment, the robot should find some sequence of actions to travel reliably from start to goal, if such a sequence exists. The resulting plan should guarantee the robot reaches the goal segment despite any movement errors experienced within some known error bound. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find such an action sequence, implement and evaluate this algorithm, and present evidence for the feasibility of such an algorithm in an underwater navigation setting.

### [ProMi: An Efficient Prototype-Mixture Baseline for Few-Shot Segmentation with Bounding-Box Annotations]()

In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows robots to perform complex tasks with minimal training data, facilitating their adaptation to diverse, real-world environments. However, pixel-level annotations of even small amount of images is highly time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present a novel few-shot binary segmentation method based on bounding-box annotations instead of pixel-level labels. We introduce, ProMi, an efficient prototype-mixture-based method that treats the background class as a mixture of distributions. Our approach is simple, training-free, and effective, accommodating coarse annotations with ease. Compared to existing baselines, ProMi achieves the best results across different datasets with significant gains, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we present qualitative experiments tailored to real-world mobile robot tasks, demonstrating the applicability of our approach in such scenarios.

### [IRef-VLA: A Benchmark for Interactive Referential Grounding with Imperfect Language in 3D Scenes]()

With the recent rise of large language models, vision-language models, and other general foundation models, there is growing potential for multimodal, multi-task robotics that can operate in diverse environments given natural language input. One such application is indoor navigation using natural language instructions. However, despite recent progress, this problem remains challenging due to the 3D spatial reasoning and semantic understanding required. Additionally, the language used may be imperfect or misaligned with the scene, further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we curate a benchmark dataset, IRef-VLA, for Interactive Referential Vision and Language-guided Action in 3D Scenes with imperfect references. IRef-VLA is the largest real-world dataset for the referential grounding task, consisting of over 11.5K scanned 3D rooms from existing datasets, 7.6M heuristically generated semantic relations, and 4.7M referential statements. Our dataset also contains semantic object and room annotations, scene graphs, navigable free space annotations, and is augmented with statements where the language has imperfections or ambiguities. We verify the generalizability of our dataset by evaluating with state-of-the-art models to obtain a performance baseline and also develop a graph-search baseline to demonstrate the performance bound and generation of alternatives using scene-graph knowledge. With this benchmark, we aim to provide a resource for 3D scene understanding that aids the development of robust, interactive navigation systems. The dataset and all source code is publicly released.

### [PTS-Map: Probabilistic Terrain State Map for Uncertainty-Aware Traversability Mapping in Unstructured Environments]()

Traversability mapping for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments has been widely investigated for decades. However, it remains challenging due to the uncertainty in geometry perception and the simplified representation of traversability maps that fail to capture detailed structures of environments. We propose PTS-Map, a 2.5D probabilistic terrain state map to address these issues. PTS-Map sequentially updates the ground surface state and above-ground elevation state, explicitly distinguishing the geometric features of ground and obstacles. During state updates, we introduce a novel ground uncertainty estimation to mitigate the effects of unreliable feature measurements. By effectively designing the terrain states and addressing the uncertainty of the ground surface, PTS-Map constructs a temporally consistent traversability map that provides precise ground conditions and vertical features relevant to navigation. Experiments are conducted in various large-scale unstructured environments with distinct characteristics. PTS-Map outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in success rate and efficiency by constructing a precise traversability map of the environments.

### [Efficient Non-Myopic Layered Bayesian Optimization for Large-Scale Bathymetric Informative Path Planning]()

Informative path planning (IPP) applied to bathymetric mapping allows AUVs to focus on feature-rich areas to quickly reduce uncertainty and increase mapping efficiency. Existing methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO) over Gaussian Process (GP) maps work well on small scenarios but they are short-sighted and computationally heavy when mapping larger areas, hindering deployment in real applications. To overcome this, we present a 2-layered BO IPP method that performs non-myopic, real-time planning in a tree Search fashion over large Stochastic Variational GP maps, while respecting the AUV motion constraints and accounting for localization uncertainty. Our framework outperforms the standard industrial lawn-mowing pattern and a myopic baseline in a set of hardware in the loop (HIL) experiments in an embedded platform over real bathymetry.

### [Visual Lidar Recursive Online Tracker (ViLiROT) for Autonomous Surface Vessels]()

We propose a multi-sensor fusion pipeline for multiple object tracking in autonomous surface vessels using lidar and camera data. Our approach follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm, leveraging the precision of lidar for accurate state estimation and camera data for robust association. The method addresses issues with false tracks from lidar returns by suppressing non-moving objects on the basis of optical flow. We compare the proposed pipeline against prior work, particularly in the use of lidar and stereo cameras as depth modalities, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving tracking performance.

### [Open-Set Semantic Uncertainty Aware Metric-Semantic Graph Matching]()

Underwater object-level mapping requires incorporating visual foundation models to handle the uncommon and often previously unseen object classes encountered in marine scenarios. In this work, a metric of semantic uncertainty for open-set object detections produced by visual foundation models is calculated and then incorporated into an object-level uncertainty tracking framework. Object-level uncertainties and geometric relationships between objects are used to enable robust object-level loop closure detection for unknown object classes. The above loop closure detection problem is formulated as a graph matching problem. While graph matching, in general, is NP-Complete, a solver for an equivalent formulation of the proposed graph matching problem as a graph editing problem is tested on multiple challenging underwater scenes. Results for this solver as well as three other solvers demonstrate that the proposed methods are feasible for real-time use in marine environments for the robust, open-set, multi-object, semantic-uncertainty-aware loop closure detection. Further experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the method generalizes to large-scale terrestrial scenes.

### [AI-Enhanced Automatic Design of Efficient Underwater Gliders]()

The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with significant implications for ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.

### [EnKode: Active Learning of Unknown Flows with Koopman Operators]()

In this letter, we address the task of adaptive sampling to model vector fields. When modeling environmental phenomena with a robot, gathering high resolution information can be resource intensive. Actively gathering data and modeling flows with the data is a more efficient alternative. However, in such scenarios, data is often sparse and thus requires flow modeling techniques that are effective at capturing the relevant dynamical features of the flow to ensure high prediction accuracy of the resulting models. To accomplish this effectively, regions with high informative value must be identified. We propose EnKode, an active sampling approach based on Koopman Operator theory and ensemble methods that can build high quality flow models and effectively estimate model uncertainty. For modeling complex flows, EnKode provides comparable or better estimates of unsampled flow regions than Gaussian Process Regression models with hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, our active sensing scheme provides more accurate flow estimates than comparable strategies that rely on uniform sampling. We evaluate EnKode using three common benchmarking systems: the Bickley Jet, Lid-Driven Cavity flow with an obstacle, and real ocean currents from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

### [A Cylindrical Halbach Array Magnetic Actuation System for Longitudinal Robot Actuation across 2D Workplane]()

Magnetic actuation has been widely investigated for miniature robot control due to its wireless control capability. As a permanent magnetic (PM) actuation system, the Halbach array can provide strong and controllable magnetic fields with large motion workspace. However, existing cylindrical Halbach array systems can only generate axial force along its central axis and require the workspace (i.e., patient anatomy) to be manipulated inside the system for any useful robot manipulation, severely limiting their application for robotic surgery. In this work, we introduce a cylindrical Halbach array actuation system capable of generating a magnetic field with longitudinal gradients across a 2-dimensional (2D) workplane instead of only along the central axis, effectively extending the longitudinal force actuation coverage from 1D to a 2D plane. This is achieved by optimizing the magnet sizes and roll angles of the Halbach rows arranged circumferentially around the system. Co-alignment between the field and gradient directions is also achieved through proper configuration of the magnet pitch angles along each Halbach row, resulting in tip-leading robot motion capability. A series of model-based simulations were performed during the optimization process and later verified experimentally. The actuation system was experimentally demonstrated to stably drive a 2mm diameter magnetic robot longitudinally at different locations within the workplane and at different velocities. This represents a significant advancement towards deploying cylindrical Halbach array systems for robot manipulation in clinical cases.

### [Towards Autonomous Verification: Integrating Cognitive AI and Semantic Digital Twins in Medical Robotics]()

In medical laboratory environments, where precision and safety are critical, the deployment of autonomous robots requires not only accurate object manipulation but also the ability to verify task success to comply with regulatory requirements. This paper introduces a novel imagination-enabled perception framework that integrates cognitive AI with semantic digital twins to allow medical robots to simulate task outcomes, compare them with real-world results, and autonomously verify the success of their actions. Our approach addresses challenges related to handling small and transparent objects commonly found in sterility testing kits and other related consumables. By enhancing the RoboKudo perception system with parthood-based reasoning, we enable more accurate task verification through focused attention on object subparts. Experiments show that our system significantly improves performance compared to traditional object-centric methods, increasing accuracy in complex environments without the need for extensive retraining. This work demonstrates a novel concept in making robotic systems more adaptable and reliable for critical tasks in medical laboratories.

### [SC-Former: A Segmentation Convolution Transformer for Lung Surgery Robots]()

For lung surgery robots, the precise segmentation of pulmonary fissures is very important. Damaging the interlobar fissures during surgery can have serious consequences. Accurately segmenting weak and abnormal fissures commonly found in clinical CT scans remains a challenging task. To solve the above problem, we aimed to develop a novel Convolution Transformer for accurate fissure segmentation (SC-Former). The proposed SC-Former adopts an encoder, attention block, and decoder structure. First, we designed an encoder with a hybrid CNNs-transformer block that ingeniously amalgamates coordinate convolution and coordinate transformer to effectively capture both local and global feature information. Second, we introduced the long skip connections of our designed attention block at layers of the decoder-encoder structure to emphasize the field of view for fissures. Third, we added the distance map strategy to alleviate the challenge of training the network to segment the false positives from the complex textures in the lung. Fourth, we developed a multi-scale supervision strategy for independent prediction at various decoder levels, effectively integrating multi-scale semantic information to facilitate the segmentation of weak and abnormal fissures. Because of the lack of open-source inter-pulmonary fissure datasets, we collected 3D CT scans from 400 participants in the clinical trial and created a new high-quality dataset: BMI dataset. Extensive experiments on this dataset revealed the great superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art competitors. The ablation study also validated the effectiveness and robustness of each part of SC-Former.

### [Passive Bilateral Surgical Teleoperation with RCM and Spatial Constraints in the Presence of Time Delays]()

The primary issue in bilateral teleportation setups is the existence of communication delays, which can destabilize the system. We are addressing this challenge in the case of a bilateral leader-follower surgical setup, where the surgeon uses a haptic device as the leader robot to manipulate the surgical instrument held by a general-purpose manipulator, the follower robot. The follower robot is equipped with an elongated tool that through a small incision passes inside the patient's body, where sensitive structures may exist. These structures may include organs, arteries, or veins that require protection during surgery. To address this challenge, we propose a bilateral control framework that is proven to maintain passivity, ensure bounded tracking errors between the leader and follower robots, and impose remote center of motion and spatial constraints related with the sensitive structures, all in the presence of constant and variable communication delays. Experimental results in a virtual intraoperative environment, using a point cloud of a kidney and its surrounding vessels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our control scheme under various communication delay scenarios.

### [Direction Informed Trees (DIT*): Optimal Path Planning Via Direction Filter and Direction Cost Heuristic]()

Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge, resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at: https://youtu.be/2SX6QT2NOek.

A novel method for optimal motion planning in the context of a class of dynamical system is proposed in this work. Our approach is based on the design of a provably safe and convergent actor structure, which is optimized via a policy iteration method. The proposed actor has wide applications, from control of mechanical systems to providing acceleration commands for more complex robotic platforms. Extra care is taken to provide theoretical guarantees, and the scheme is validated against an existing sampling-based planner.

### [Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Query Path Planning for a Polygonal Robot]()

Shortest-path roadmaps, also known as reduced visibility graphs, provide a highly efficient multi-query method for computing optimal paths in two-dimensional environments. Combined with Minkowski sum computations, shortest-path roadmaps can compute optimal paths for a translating robot in 2D. In this study, we explore the intuitive idea of stacking up a set of reduced visibility graphs at different orientations for a polygonal holonomic robot to support the fast computation of near-optimal paths, allowing simultaneous 2D translation and rotation. The resulting algorithm, rotation-stacked visibility graph(RVG), is shown to be resolution-complete and asymptotically optimal. Extensive computational experiments show RVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-query sampling-based methods on both computation time and solution optimality fronts.

### [Asymptotically Optimal Sampling-Based Motion Planning through Anytime Incremental Lazy Bidirectional Heuristic Search]()

This paper introduces Bidirectional Lazy Informed Trees (BLIT*), the first algorithm to incorporate anytime incremental lazy bidirectional heuristic search (Bi-HS) into batch-wise sampling-based motion planning (Bw-SBMP). BLIT* operates on batches of informed states (states that can potentially improve the cost of the incumbent solution) structured as an implicit random geometric graph (RGG). The computational cost of collision detection is mitigated via a new lazy edge-evaluation strategy by focusing on states near obstacles. Experimental results, especially in high dimensions, show that BLIT* outperforms existing Bw-SBMP planners by efficiently finding an initial solution and effectively improving the quality as more computational resources are available.

### [Propagative Distance Optimization for Motion Planning]()

This paper focuses on the motion planning problem for serial articulated robots with revolute joints under kinematic constraints. Many motion planners leverage iterative local optimization methods but are often trapped in local minima due to non-convexity of the problem. A key reason for the non-convexity is the trigonometric term when parameterizing the kinematics using joint angles. Recent distance-based formulation can eliminate these trigonometric terms by formulating the kinematics based on distances, and has shown superior performance against classic joint angle based formulations in domains like inverse kinematics (IK). However, distance-based kinematics formulations have not yet been studied for motion planning, and naively applying them for motion planning may lead to poor computational efficiency. In particular, IK seeks one configuration while motion planning seeks a sequence of configurations, which greatly increases the scale of the underlying optimization problem. This paper proposes Propagative Distance Optimization for Motion Planning (PDOMP), which addresses the challenge by (i) introducing a new compact representation that reduces the number of variables in the distance-based formulation, and (ii) leveraging the chain structure to efficiently compute forward kinematics and Jacobians of the robot among waypoints along a path.

### [Dynamically Feasible Path Planning in Cluttered Environments Via Reachable B'ezier Polytopes]()

The deployment of robotic systems in real world environments requires the ability to quickly produce paths through cluttered, non-convex spaces. These planned trajectories must be both kinematically feasible (i.e., collision free) and dynamically feasible (i.e., satisfy the underlying system dynamics), necessitating a consideration of both the free space and the dynamics of the robot in the path planning phase. In this work, we explore the application of reachable Bezier polytopes as an efficient tool for generating trajectories satisfying both kinematic and dynamic requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by offloading specific computation tasks to the GPU, such an algorithm can meet tight real time requirements. We propose a layered control architecture that efficiently produces collision free and dynamically feasible paths for nonlinear control systems, and demonstrate the framework on the tasks of 3D hopping in a cluttered environment.

### [CoPeD--Advancing Multi-Robot Collaborative Perception: A Comprehensive Dataset in Real-World Environments]()

In the past decade, although single-robot perception has made significant advancements, the exploration of multi-robot collaborative perception remains largely unexplored. This involves fusing compressed, intermittent, limited, heterogeneous, and asynchronous environmental information across multiple robots to enhance overall perception, despite challenges like sensor noise, occlusions, and sensor failures. One major hurdle has been the lack of real-world datasets. This paper presents a pioneering and comprehensive real-world multi-robot collaborative perception dataset to boost research in this area. Our dataset leverages the untapped potential of air-ground robot collaboration featuring distinct spatial viewpoints, complementary robot mobilities, coverage ranges, and sensor modalities. It features raw sensor inputs, pose estimation, and optional high-level perception annotation, thus accommodating diverse research interests. Compared to existing datasets predominantly designed for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), our setup ensures a diverse range and adequate overlap of sensor views to facilitate the study of multi-robot collaborative perception algorithms. We demonstrate the value of this dataset qualitatively through multiple collaborative perception tasks. We believe this work will unlock the potential research of high-level scene understanding through multi-modal collaborative perception in multi-robot settings.

### [Generalized Synchronized Active Learning for Multi-Agent-Based Data Selection on Mobile Robotic Systems]()

In mobile robotics, perception in uncontrolled environments like autonomous driving is a central hurdle. Existing active learning frameworks can help enhance perception by efficiently selecting data samples for labeling but are often constrained by the necessity of full data availability in data centers, hindering real-time on-field adaptations. To address this, our work unveils a novel active learning formulation optimized for multi-robot settings. It harnesses the collaborative power of several robotic agents, considerably enhancing data acquisition and synchronization processes. Experimental evidence indicates that our approach markedly surpasses traditional active learning frameworks by up to 2.5 percent points and 90% less data uploads, delivering new possibilities for advancements in the realms of mobile robotics and autonomous systems.

### [Scenario-Based Curriculum Generation for Multi-Agent Driving]()

The automated generation of diversified training scenarios has been an important ingredient in many complex learning tasks, especially in real-world application domains such as autonomous driving, where auto-curriculum generation is considered vital for obtaining robust and general policies. However, crafting traffic scenarios with multiple, heterogeneous agents is typically considered a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in more complex simulation environments. To this end, we introduce MATS-Gym, a multi-agent training framework for autonomous driving that uses partial-scenario specifications to generate traffic scenarios with a variable number of agents which are executed in CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator. MATS-Gym reconciles scenario execution engines, such as Scenic and ScenarioRunner, with established multi-agent training frameworks where the interaction between the environment and the agents is modeled as a partially observable stochastic game. Furthermore, we integrate MATS-Gym with techniques from unsupervised environment design to automate the generation of adaptive auto-curricula, which is the first application of such algorithms to the domain of autonomous driving. The code is available at https://github.com/AutonomousDrivingExaminer/mats-gym.

### [ZeroCAP: Zero-Shot Multi-Robot Context Aware Pattern Formation Via Large Language Models]()

Incorporating language comprehension into robotic operations unlocks significant advancements in robotics, but also presents distinct challenges, particularly in executing spatially oriented tasks like pattern formation. This paper introduces ZeroCAP, a novel system that integrates large language models with multi-robot systems for zero-shot context aware pattern formation. Grounded in the principles of language-conditioned robotics, ZeroCAP leverages the interpretative power of language models to translate natural language instructions into actionable robotic configurations. This approach combines the synergy of vision-language models, cutting-edge segmentation techniques and shape descriptors, enabling the realization of complex, context-driven pattern formations in the realm of multi robot coordination. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the systems proficiency in executing complex context aware pattern formations across a spectrum of tasks, from surrounding and caging objects to infilling regions. This not only validates the system's capability to interpret and implement intricate context-driven tasks but also underscores its adaptability and effectiveness across varied environments and scenarios.

### [Multi-Robot Collaboration through Reinforcement Learning and Abstract Simulation]()

Teams of people coordinate to perform complex tasks by forming abstract mental models of world and agent dynamics. The use of abstract models contrasts with much recent work in robot learning that uses a high-fidelity simulator and reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain policies for physical robots. Motivated by this difference, we investigate the extent to which so-called abstract simulators can be used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the resulting policies successfully deployed on teams of physical robots. An abstract simulator models the robot's target task at a high-level of abstraction and discards many details of the world that could impact optimal decision-making. Policies are trained in an abstract simulator then transferred to the physical robot by making use of separately-obtained low-level perception and motion control modules. We identify three key categories of modifications to the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots: simulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation stochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to determine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer in cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies produced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior architecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach leads to a similar level of performance. Broadly we show that MARL can be use to train cooperative physical robot behaviors using highly abstract models of the world.

### [Graph-Based Decentralized Task Allocation for Multi-Robot Target Localization]()

We introduce a new graph neural operator-based approach for task allocation in a system of heterogeneous robots composed of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Un- manned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed model, GATAR, or Graph Attention Task AllocatoR aggregates information from neighbors in the multi-robot system, with the aim of achieving globally optimal target localization. Being decentral- ized, our method is highly robust and adaptable to situations where the number of robots and the number of tasks may change over time. We also propose a heterogeneity-aware preprocessing technique to model the heterogeneity of the system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach in a range of simulated scenarios generated by varying the number of UGVs and UAVs and the number and location of the targets. We show that a single model can handle a heterogeneous robot team with the number of robots ranging between 2 and 12, while outperforming the baseline architectures.

### [Towards Embedding Dynamic Personas in Interactive Robots: Masquerading Animated Social Kinematic (MASK)]()

This paper presents the design and development of an innovative interactive robotic system to enhance audience engagement using character-like personas. Built upon the foundations of persona-driven dialog agents, this work extends the agent’s application to the physical realm, employing robots to provide a more captivating and interactive experience. The proposed system, named the Masquerading Animated Social Kinematic (MASK), leverages an anthropomorphic robot which interacts with guests using non-verbal interactions, including facial expressions and gestures. A behavior generation system based upon a finite-state machine structure effectively conditions robotic behavior to convey distinct personas. The MASK framework integrates a perception engine, a behavior selection engine, and a comprehensive action library to enable real-time, dynamic interactions with minimal human intervention in behavior design. Throughout the user subject studies, we examined whether the users could recognize the intended character in both personality- and film-character-based persona conditions. We conclude by discussing the role of personas in interactive agents and the factors to consider for creating an engaging user experience.

### [Simultaneous Dialogue Services Using Multiple Semiautonomous Robots in Multiple Locations by a Single Operator: A Field Trial on Souvenir Recommendation]()

Recently, systems have emerged enabling a single operator to engage with users across multiple locations simultaneously. However, under such systems, a potential challenge exists where the operator, upon switching locations, may need to join ongoing conversations without a complete understanding of their history. Consequently, a seamless transition and the development of high-quality conversations may be impeded. This study directs its attention to the utilization of multiple robots, aiming to create a semiautonomous teleoperation system. This system enables an operator to switch between twin robots at each location as needed, thereby facilitating the provision of higher-quality dialogue services simultaneously. As an initial phase, a field experiment was conducted to assess user satisfaction with recommendations made by the operator using twin robots. Results collected from 391 participants over 13 days revealed heightened user satisfaction when the operator intervened and provided recommendations through multiple robots compared with autonomous recommendations by the robots. These findings contribute significantly to the formulation of a teleoperation system that allows a single operator to deliver multipoint conversational services.

### [Safety and Naturalness Perceptions of Robot-To-Human Handovers Performed by Data-Driven Robotic Mimicry of Human Givers]()

We study human perceptions of a robot that performs robot-to-human (R2H) handovers controlled to grasp, transport, and transfer 34 objects by mimicking human givers in human-human (H2H) handover data. Recognizing the importance of human-like robotic behavior for successful collaboration, R2H studies use models of human behavior or observations of H2H data to plan robot giver motion. However, R2H studies have been limited in object counts. In this work, we use the Human-Object-Human (HOH) dataset, consisting of H2H interactions performed by 20 giver-receiver pairs with 136 objects, to conduct an R2H study with 34 objects. We teleoperate a Kinova Gen3 manipulator to grip an object as grasped by an HOH human giver, and program it to automatically transport and orient the object to a participant by mimicking the HOH giver's trajectory and transfer pose. We survey participants on safety, naturalness, and preferred choice over linear trajectory and random orientation baselines. We find that transfer pose influences perceptions of naturalness, with HOH poses showing higher naturalness ratings. Participants prefer handovers with HOH end poses when asked to pick their preferred interaction.

### [Integrating Human-Robot Teaming Dynamics into Mission Planning Tools for Transparent Tactics in Multi-Robot Human Integrated Teams]()

This research aims to demonstrate how integrating human-robot teaming dynamics into mission planning tools impacts the abilities of robot operators as they coordinate multiple robot agents during a mission. This was investigated in a pilot study using two inter-robot collaboration modalities and interface tools, which required different human-robot interaction techniques to execute a mission with a team of four robots. In the first modality, the operator manually inserted waypoints for each robot, as they acted as individual agents. In the second modality, the operator used the Planning Execution to After-Action Review (PETAAR) toolset to plot a single waypoint for the team of robots, as the robots coordinated their movement as a group. One novel component of this study is the investigation of how human-robot teaming dynamics and the PETAAR toolset impacted robot operators' real-time situation awareness and perceived cognitive load as well as team performance. Although the teaming modalities differed greatly with respect to the level of operator input needed, the time required to complete the simulation, the participant’s perceived cognitive load, and interface usability were very similar for both modalities. In contrast, the results revealed statistically significant differences between the two teaming modalities related to participants’ abilities to maintain a wedge formation while remaining situationally aware. Results from this work will be used to guide development of PETAAR along with the design of future studies investigating more complex teaming scenarios and for creating a baseline for comparing future results.

### [XBG: End-To-End Imitation Learning for Autonomous Behaviour in Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration]()

This paper presents XBG (eXteroceptive Behaviour Generation), a multimodal end-to-end Imitation Learning (IL) system for a whole-body autonomous humanoid robot used in real-world Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The main contribution is an architecture for learning HRI behaviours using a data-driven approach. A diverse dataset is collected via teleoperation, covering multiple HRI scenarios, such as handshaking, handwaving, payload reception, walking, and walking with a payload. After synchronizing, filtering, and transforming the data, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained, integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive information to help the robot understand both its environment and its actions. The robot takes in sequences of images (RGB and depth) and joints state information to react accordingly. By fusing multimodal signals over time, the model enables autonomous capabilities in a robotic platform. The models are evaluated based on the success rates in the mentioned HRI scenarios and they are deployed on the ergoCub humanoid robot. XBG achieves success rates between 60% and 100% even when tested in unseen environments.

### [CoL3D: Collaborative Learning of Single-View Depth and Camera Intrinsics for Metric 3D Shape Recovery]()

Recovering the metric 3D shape from a single image is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied intelligence applications, where accurate spatial understanding is crucial for navigation and interaction with environments. Usually, the mainstream approaches achieve it through monocular depth estimation. However, without camera intrinsics, the 3D metric shape can not be recovered from depth alone. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that depth serves as a 3D prior constraint for estimating camera intrinsics and uncover the reciprocal relations between these two elements. Motivated by this, we propose a collaborative learning framework for jointly estimating depth and camera intrinsics, named CoL3D, to learn metric 3D shapes from single images. Specifically, CoL3D adopts a unified network and performs collaborative optimization at three levels: depth, camera intrinsics, and 3D point clouds. For camera intrinsics, we design a canonical incidence field mechanism as a prior that enables the model to learn the residual incident field for enhanced calibration. Additionally, we incorporate a shape similarity measurement loss in the point cloud space, which improves the quality of 3D shapes essential for robotic applications. As a result, when training and testing on a single dataset with in-domain settings, CoL3D delivers outstanding performance in both depth estimation and camera calibration across several indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets, which leads to remarkable 3D shape quality for the perception capabilities of robots.

### [Non-Destructive 3D Root Structure Modeling]()

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained significant attention in 3D object reconstruction. However, detecting and reconstructing hidden or buried objects underground remains a challenging task. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a cost-effective and non-destructive technology for subsurface object detection, including soil structures, pipelines, and plant roots. In this study, we present a deep convolutional neural network-based method for detecting target signals and performing curve parameter regression using multiple B-scans from GPR data. By leveraging the detection and regression outcomes, we further generate fitted curves that represent underground structures. To reconstruct a comprehensive and detailed 3D root structure, we design a shape reconstruction network that takes sparse sliced 3D points as input. The proposed approach is extensively trained and validated using synthetic 3D root datasets and simulated GPR data generated with gprMax. Additionally, the trained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities when applied to real-world GPR data, ensuring its practical applicability.

### [PTZ-Calib: Robust Pan-Tilt-Zoom Camera Calibration]()

In this paper, we present PTZ-Calib, a robust two-stage PTZ camera calibration method, that efficiently and accurately estimates camera parameters for arbitrary viewpoints. Our method includes an offline and an online stage. In the offline stage, we first uniformly select a set of reference images that sufficiently overlap to encompass a complete 360° view. We then utilize the novel PTZ-IBA (PTZ Incremental Bundle Adjustment) algorithm to automatically calibrate the cameras within a local coordinate system. Additionally, for practical application, we can further optimize camera parameters and align them with the geographic coordinate system using extra global reference 3D information. In the online stage, we formulate the calibration of any new viewpoints as a relocalization problem. Our approach balances the accuracy and computational efficiency to meet real-world demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our robustness and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on various real and synthetic datasets.

### [CtRNet-X: Camera-To-Robot Pose Estimation in Real-World Conditions Using a Single Camera]()

Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose estimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups for camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible within the camera's field of view. However, in practice robots usually move in and out of view and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the whole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the Vision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and integrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated on both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation scenarios.

### [Foundation Feature-Driven Online End-Effector Pose Estimation: A Marker-Free and Learning-Free Approach]()

Accurate transformation estimation between camera space and robot space is essential. Traditional methods using markers for hand-eye calibration require offline image collection, limiting their suitability for online self-calibration. Recent learning-based robot pose estimation methods, while advancing online calibration, struggle with cross-robot generalization and require the robot to be fully visible. This work proposes a Foundation feature-driven online End-Effector Pose Estimation (FEEPE) algorithm, characterized by its training-free and cross-end-effector generalization capabilities. Inspired by the zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models, FEEPE leverages pre-trained visual features to estimate 2D-3D correspondences derived from CAD models and reference images, enabling 6D pose estimation via the PnP algorithm. To resolve ambiguities from partial observations and symmetry, a multihistorical key frame enhanced pose optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing temporal information for improved accuracy. Compared to traditional hand-eye calibration, FEEPE enables marker-free online calibration. Unlike robot pose estimation, it generalizes across robots and end-effectors in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior flexibility, generalization, and performance.

### [Camera-LiDAR Extrinsic Calibration Using Constrained Optimization with Circle Placement]()

Monocular camera-LiDAR data fusion has demonstrated remarkable environmental perception capabilities in various fields. The success of data fusion relies on the accurate matching of correspondence features from images and point clouds. In this letter, we propose a target-based Camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration by matching correspondences in both data. Specifically, to extract accurate features from the point cloud, we propose a novel method that estimates the circle centers by optimizing the probability distribution from the initial position. This optimization involves generating the probability distribution of circle centers from circle edge points and using the Lagrangian multiplier method to estimate the optimal positions of the circle centers. We conduct two types of experiments: simulations for quantitative results and real system eval uations for qualitative assessment. Our method demonstrates a 21% improvement in simulation calibration performance for 20 target poses with LiDAR noise of 0.03 m compared to existing methods, and also shows high visual quality in reprojecting point cloud onto images in real-world scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/AIRLABkhu/SquareCalib.

### [A Modeling and Control Strategy for the Gaze-Guided Teleoperation of Robotic Manipulators Via Smart Glasses]()

Object manipulation is a high-frequency task required in assistive robotic systems in order to aid the elderly or those with disabilities that impact motor control. In the instance where arms cannot be used to command a robot, gaze-tracking via smart glasses is a suitable candidate. In this work, we develop a modeling method and model-based filtering and control strategy for direct gaze-guided teleoperation of robotic manipulators. We demonstrate the feasibility of this control strategy in an object manipulation case study with six participants. The results indicate that a model-based gaze filtering and control strategy produces smooth commands for the robot that are easy for the participants to use. These methods can reduce the perceived workload of the user by 37.51% and lower the gripper positioning error by 39.09% compared to using unfiltered gaze data.

### [Unlocking Potential: Gaze-Based Interfaces in Assistive Robotics for Users with Severe Speech and Motor Impairment]()

Individuals with Severe Speech and Motor Impairment (SSMI) struggle to interact with their surroundings due to physical and communicative limitations. To address these challenges, this paper presents a gaze-controlled robotic system that helps SSMI users perform stamp printing tasks. The system includes gaze-controlled interfaces and a robotic arm with a gripper, designed specifically for SSMI users to enhance accessibility and interaction. User studies with gaze-controlled interfaces such as video see-through (VST), video pass-through (VPT), and optical see-through (OST) displays demonstrated the system's effectiveness. Results showed that VST had the average stamping time of 28.45 s (SD = 15.44 s) and the average stamp count 7.36 (SD = 3.83), outperforming VPT and OST.

### [Do Looks Matter? Exploring Functional and Aesthetic Design Preferences for a Robotic Guide Dog]()

Dog guides offer an effective mobility solution for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, but conventional dog guides have limitations including the need for care, potential distractions, societal prejudice, high costs, and limited availability. To address these challenges, we seek to develop a robot dog guide capable of performing the tasks of a conventional dog guide, enhanced with additional features. In this work, we focus on design research to identify functional and aesthetic design concepts to implement into a quadrupedal robot. The aesthetic design remains relevant even for BVI users due to their sensitivity toward societal perceptions and the need for smooth integration into society. We collected data through interviews and surveys to answer specific design questions pertaining to the appearance, texture, features, and method of controlling and communicating with the robot. Our study identified essential and preferred features for a future robot dog guide, which are supported by relevant statistics aligning with each suggestion. These findings will inform the future development of user-centered designs to effectively meet the needs of BVI individuals.

### [Comparison of Three Interface Approaches for Gaze Control of Assistive Robots for Individuals with Tetraplegia]()

Individuals with tetraplegia have their independence and quality of life severely affected. Assistive robotic arms can enhance their autonomy, but effective control interfaces are essential for optimizing their usability and performance. This study aims to evaluate the performance and user experience of three control interfaces for an assistive robotic arm: Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), Embedded Interface, and Directional Gaze. Thirty-three able-bodied participants were recruited to control an assistive robotic arm through the three different interfaces in a between-subjects experiment. Performance was measured using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Block Pick and Place Protocol. Usability (SUS) and task, workload (NASA-TLX) were measured through subjective questionnaires. Additionally, we report saccades per minute and fixation duration. The results revealed statistically significant differences showing that Embedded and GUI interfaces, when compared to the Directional Gaze interface, can lead to lower workloads and higher performance in pick-up tasks.

### [A Laser-Guided Interaction Interface for Providing Effective Robot Assistance to People with Upper Limbs Impairments]()

Robotics has shown significant potential in assisting people with disabilities to enhance their independence and involvement in daily activities. Indeed, a societal long-term impact is expected in home-care assistance with the deployment of intelligent robotic interfaces. This work presents a human-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments, such as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The proposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which utilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the laser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide the robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate objects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head, enabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that point the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural network based perception module. The interface implements two control modalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly, commanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard with buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These buttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the action of the gripper. The proposed interface is evaluated in a series of manipulation tasks involving a 6DOF assistive robot manipulator equipped with 1DOF beak-like gripper. The two interface modalities are combined to successfully accomplish tasks requiring bimanual capacity that is usually affected in people with upper limbs impairments.

### [Gravity Compensation Method for Whole Body-Mounted Robot with Contact Force Distribution Sensor]()

The emergence of sheet-type force distribution sensors has allowed direct measurement of contact force. We developed a wearable assistive robot that can directly measure contact force and investigated the gravity compensation effect of contact-force-based control. For conventional robots that do not measure the force acting between the robot and the human body (contact force) directly, a precise robot model is required for gravity compensation, which is difficult to implement in software. In the first experiment, we examined a method of gravity compensation using only joint sensors in torque-based control, which is a common conventional method, and assessed the difficulty of this method. In the next experiment, which involved one healthy subject, we confirmed that contact-force-based control has a significant gravity compensation effect without requiring a rigorous robot model. Experiments with two additional healthy subjects using the same parameters revealed that even rough parameter tuning can produce a gravity compensation effect. This study not only proposes a simplified gravity compensator for wearable assistive robots but also demonstrates the robustness of parameter tuning in contact-force-based control under static conditions. Based on the findings of this study, we will further study the possibility of other kinds of disturbance compensation and dynamic conditions in the future.

### [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Gait State Estimation]()

Exoskeleton controllers have recently employed machine learning (ML) techniques to provide appropriate assistance throughout the terrains of the real world. One successful approach has been to learn a mapping between an exoskeleton wearer's kinematic measurements and a gait state vector that encodes how the wearer is currently walking (i.e. gait phase, speed), and then dynamically update the assistance based on the gait state. However, these methods require paired datasets of input kinematics to output gait states, which usually involves manual, time-consuming labeling of data from participants wearing specific exoskeletons and thus limits the scalability of these ML methods. A prior solution to this challenge---leveraging large pre-labeled datasets of normative human walking---introduces another problem, in that networks trained on these datasets learn only normative locomotion patterns, and thus may deteriorate when the data are changed by wearing the exoskeleton itself. In this context, we present an unsupervised-learning-based approach to both bypass the requirement of labeled data for gait state prediction and address the difficulty of domain adaptation from normative to exoskeleton-assisted walking. We validate our method in a set of walking simulations that featured exoskeleton data from 14 participants. This model showed significant improvements in state estimation relative to a model trained solely on pre-labeled normative walking, while also not requiring ground truth labels. This work presents a foundation that demonstrates labeled, device-specific data may not be required for predicting walking behavior in real time.

### [Anti-Sensing: Defense against Unauthorized Radar-Based Human Vital Sign Sensing with Physically Realizable Wearable Oscillators]()

Recent advancements in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar technology have enabled contactless, non-line-of-sight vital sign monitoring, making it a valuable tool for healthcare. However, UWB radar's ability to capture sensitive physiological data, even through walls, raises significant privacy concerns, particularly in human-robot interactions and autonomous systems that rely on radar for sensing human presence and physiological functions. In this paper, we present Anti-Sensing, a novel defense mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized radar-based sensing. Our approach introduces physically realizable perturbations, such as oscillatory motion from wearable devices, to disrupt radar sensing by mimicking natural cardiac motion, thereby misleading heart rate (HR) estimations. We develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the frequency and spatial amplitude of these oscillations for maximal disruption while ensuring physiological plausibility. Through both simulations and real-world experiments with radar data and neural network-based HR sensing models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Anti-Sensing in significantly degrading model accuracy, offering a practical solution for privacy preservation.

### [Vision-Based Fuzzy Control System with Intention Detection for Smart Walkers: Enhancing Usability for Stroke Survivors with Unilateral Upper Limb Impairments]()

Mobility impairments, particularly those caused by stroke-induced hemiparesis, significantly impact independence and quality of life. Current smart walker controllers operate by using input forces from the user to control linear motion and input torques to dictate rotational movement; however, because they predominantly rely on user-applied torque exerted on the device handle as an indicator of user intent to turn, they fail to adequately accommodate users with unilateral upper limb impairments. This leads to increased physical strain and cognitive load. This paper introduces a novel smart walker equipped with a fuzzy control algorithm that leverages shoulder abduction angles to intuitively interpret user intentions using just one functional hand. By integrating a force sensor and stereo camera, the system enhances walker responsiveness, usability, and safety. Experimental evaluations with five participants demonstrated that the fuzzy controller significantly reduced wrist torque and improved user comfort compared to traditional admittance controllers. Results confirmed a strong correlation between shoulder abduction angles and directional intent, with users reporting decreased effort and enhanced ease of use. This study contributes to assistive robotics by providing an adaptable control mechanism for smart walkers, suggesting a pathway towards enhancing mobility and independence for individuals with mobility impairments.

### [A Lower Limb Wearable Exosuit for Improved Sitting, Standing, and Walking Efficiency]()

Sitting, standing, and walking are fundamental activities crucial for maintaining independence in daily life. However, aging or lower limb injuries can impede these activities, posing obstacles to individuals' autonomy. In response to this challenge, we developed the LM-Ease, a compact and soft wearable robot designed to provide hip assistance. Its purpose is to aid users in carrying out essential daily activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. The LM-Ease features a fully-actuated tendon-driven system that seamlessly transitions between assistance actuation profiles tailored for sitting, standing, and walking movements. This device provides the user with gravity support during stand-to-sit, and offers hip extension assistance pulling force during sit-to-stand and walking. Our preliminary results show that with the LM-Ease, healthy young adults (n = 8) had significantly lower muscle activation: average reduction of 15.6% during stand-to-sit and 17.8% during sit-to-stand. Furthermore, with LM-Ease, participants demonstrated a 12.7% reduction in metabolic cost during ground walking.

### [Towards Shape-Adaptive Attachment Design for Wearable Devices Using Granular Jamming]()

Attaching a wearable device to the user's body for comfort and function while accommodating the differences and changes in body shapes often represents a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses this problem through granular jamming, where a granule-filled membrane stiffens by rapidly decreasing the internal air pressure (e.g., vacuum), causing the granule material to be jammed together due to friction. This structure was used to conform to complex shapes of the human body when it is in the soft state while switching to the rigid state for proper robot functions by jamming the granules via vacuum. We performed an experiment to systematically investigate the effect of multiple design parameters on the ability of such jamming-based interfaces to hold against a lateral force. Specifically, we developed a bench prototype where modular granular-jamming structures are attached to objects of different sizes and shapes via a downward suspension force. Our data showed that the use of jamming is necessary to increase the overall structure stability by 1.73 to 2.16 N. Furthermore, using three modules, high suspension force, and a low membrane infill (~25%) also contribute to high resistance to lateral force. Our results lay a foundation for future implementation of wearable attachments using granular-jamming structures.

### [EPRecon: An Efficient Framework for Real-Time Panoptic 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video]()

Panoptic 3D reconstruction from a monocular video is a fundamental perceptual task in robotic scene understanding. However, existing efforts suffer from inefficiency in terms of inference speed and accuracy, limiting their practical applicability. We present EPRecon, an efficient real-time panoptic 3D reconstruction framework. Current volumetric-based reconstruction methods usually utilize multi-view depth map fusion to obtain scene depth priors, which is time-consuming and poses challenges to real-time scene reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight module to directly estimate scene depth priors in a 3D volume for reconstruction quality improvement by generating occupancy probabilities of all voxels. In addition, compared with existing panoptic segmentation methods, EPRecon extracts panoptic features from both voxel features and corresponding image features, obtaining more detailed and comprehensive instance-level semantic information and achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate the superiority of EPRecon over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both panoptic 3D reconstruction quality and real-time inference. Code is available at https://github.com/zhen6618/EPRecon.

### [Neural Surface Reconstruction and Rendering for LiDAR-Visual Systems]()

This paper presents a unified surface reconstruction and rendering framework for LiDAR-visual systems, integrating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Neural Distance Fields (NDF) to recover both appearance and structural information from posed images and point clouds. We address the structural visible gap between NeRF and NDF by utilizing a visible-aware occupancy map to classify space into the free, occupied, visible unknown, and background regions. This classification facilitates the recovery of a complete appearance and structure of the scene. We unify the training of the NDF and NeRF using a spatial-varying scale SDF-to-density transformation for levels of detail for both structure and appearance. The proposed method leverages the learned NDF for structure-aware NeRF training by an adaptive sphere tracing sampling strategy for accurate structure rendering. In return, NeRF further refines structural in recovering missing or fuzzy structures in the NDF. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality and versatility of the proposed method across various scenarios. To benefit the community, the codes will be released at url{https://github.com/hku-mars/M2Mapping}.

### [LVBA: LiDAR-Visual Bundle Adjustment for RGB Point Cloud Mapping]()

Point cloud maps with accurate color are crucial in robotics and mapping applications. Existing approaches for producing RGB-colorized maps are primarily based on real-time localization using filter-based estimation or sliding window optimization, which may lack accuracy and global consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel global LiDAR-Visual bundle adjustment (BA) named LVBA to improve the quality of RGB point cloud mapping beyond existing baselines. LVBA first optimizes LiDAR poses via a global LiDAR BA, followed by a photometric visual BA incorporating planar features from the LiDAR point cloud for camera pose optimization. Additionally, to address the challenge of map point occlusions in constructing optimization problems, we implement a novel LiDAR-assisted global visibility algorithm in LVBA. To evaluate the effectiveness of LVBA, we conducted extensive experiments by comparing its mapping quality against existing state-of-the-art baselines (i.e., R3LIVE and FAST-LIVO). Our results prove that LVBA can proficiently reconstruct high-fidelity, accurate RGB point cloud maps, outperforming its counterparts.

### [LiDAR-Enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting Mapping]()

This paper introduces LiGSM, a novel LiDAR-enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping framework that improves the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene mapping by integrating LiDAR data. LiGSM constructs joint loss from images and LiDAR point clouds to estimate the poses and optimize their extrinsic parameters, enabling dynamic adaptation to variations in sensor alignment. Furthermore, it leverages LiDAR point clouds to initialize 3DGS, providing a denser and more reliable starting points compared to sparse SfM points. In scene rendering, the framework augments standard image-based supervision with depth maps generated from LiDAR projections, ensuring an accurate scene representation in both geometry and photometry. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that LiGSM outperforms comparative methods in pose tracking and scene rendering.

### [Depth-Visual-Inertial (DVI) Mapping System for Robust Indoor 3D Reconstruction]()

We propose the Depth-Visual-Inertial (DVI) Mapper: a robust multi-sensor fusion framework for dense 3D mapping using time-of-flight cameras equipped with RGB and IMU sensors. Inspired by recent developments in real-time LiDAR-based odometry and mapping, our system uses an error-state iterative Kalman filter for state estimation: it processes the inertial sensor's data for state propagation, followed by a state update first using visual-inertial odometry, then depth-based odometry. This sensor fusion scheme makes our system robust to degenerate scenarios (e.g. lack of visual or geometrical features, fast rotations) and to noisy sensor data, like those that can be obtained with off-the-shelf time-of-flight DVI sensors. For evaluation, we propose the new Bunker DVI Dataset, featuring data from multiple DVI sensors recorded in challenging conditions reflecting search-and-rescue operations. We show the superior robustness and precision of our method against previous work. Following the open science principle, we make both our source code and dataset publicly available.

### [MOSE: Monocular Semantic Reconstruction Using NeRF-Lifted Noisy Priors]()

Accurately reconstructing dense and semantically annotated 3D meshes from monocular images remains a challenging task due to the lack of geometry guidance and imperfect view-dependent 2D priors. Though we have witnessed recent advancements in implicit neural scene representations enabling precise 2D rendering simply from multi-view images, there have been few works addressing 3D scene understanding with monocular priors alone. In this paper, we propose MOSE, a neural field semantic reconstruction approach to lift inferred image-level noisy priors to 3D, producing accurate semantics and geometry in both 3D and 2D space. The key motivation for our method is to leverage generic class-agnostic segment masks as guidance to promote local consistency of rendered semantics during training. With the help of semantics, we further apply a smoothness regularization to texture-less regions for better geometric quality, thus achieving mutual benefits ofgeometry and semantics. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our MOSE outperforms relevant baselines across all metrics on tasks of 3D semantic segmentation, 2D semantic segmentation and 3D surface reconstruction.

### [Pushing in the Dark: A Reactive Pushing Strategy for Mobile Robots Using Tactile Feedback]()

For mobile robots, navigating cluttered or dynamic environments often necessitates non-prehensile manipulation, particularly when faced with objects that are too large, irregular, or fragile to grasp. The unpredictable behavior and varying physical properties of these objects significantly complicate manipulation tasks. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a novel Reactive Pushing Strategy. This strategy allows a mobile robot to dynamically adjust its base movements in real-time to achieve successful pushing maneuvers towards a target location. Notably, our strategy adapts the robot motion based on changes in contact location obtained through the tactile sensor covering the base, avoiding dependence on object-related assumptions and its modeled behavior. The effectiveness of the Reactive Pushing Strategy was initially evaluated in the simulation environment, where it significantly outperformed the compared baseline approaches. Following this, we validated the proposed strategy through real-world experiments, demonstrating the robot capability to push objects to the target points located in the entire vicinity of the robot. In both simulation and real-world experiments, the object-specific properties (shape, mass, friction, inertia) were altered along with the changes in target locations to assess the robustness of the proposed method comprehensively.

### [Foresee and Act Ahead: Task Prediction and Pre-Scheduling Enabled Efficient Robotic Warehousing]()

In warehousing systems, to enhance efficiency amid surging demand volumes, much attention has been placed on how to reasonably allocate tasks of delivery to robots. However, the labor of robots is still inevitably wasted to some extent. In this paper, we propose a pre-scheduling enhanced warehousing framework aiming to foresee and act in advance, which consists of task flow prediction and hybrid task allocation. For task prediction, we design the spatio-temporal representations of the task flow and introduce a periodicity-decoupled mechanism tailored for the generation patterns of aggregated orders, and then further extract spatial features of task distribution with a novel combination of graph structures. In hybrid tasks allocation, we consider the known tasks and predicted future tasks simultaneously to optimize the task allocation. In addition, we consider factors such as predicted task uncertainty and sector-level efficiency to realize more balanced and rational allocations. We validate our task prediction model across datasets derived from factories, achieving SOTA performance. Furthermore, we implement our system in a real-world robotic warehouse, demonstrating more than 30% improvements in efficiency.

### [Embodiment-Agnostic Action Planning Via Object-Part Scene Flow]()

Observing that the key for robotic action planning is to understand the target-object motion when its associated part is manipulated by the end effector, we propose to generate the 3D object-part scene flow and extract its transformations to solve the action trajectories for diverse embodiments. The advantage of our approach is that it derives the robot action explicitly from object motion prediction, yielding a more robust policy by understanding the object motions. Also, beyond policies trained on embodiment-centric data, our method is embodiment-agnostic, generalizable across diverse embodiments, and being able to learn from human demonstrations. Our method comprises three components: an object-part predictor to locate the part for the end effector to manipulate, an RGBD video generator to predict future RGBD videos, and a trajectory planner to extract embodiment-agnostic transformation sequences and solve the trajectory for diverse embodiments. Trained on videos even without trajectory data, our method still outperforms existing works significantly by 27.7% and 26.2% on the prevailing virtual environments MetaWorld and Franka-Kitchen, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments, showing that our policy, trained only with human demonstration, can be deployed to various embodiments.

### [Acoustic Wave Manipulation through Sparse Robotic Actuation]()

Recent advancements in robotics, control, and machine learning have facilitated progress in the challenging area of object manipulation. These advancements include, among others, the use of deep neural networks to represent dynamics that are partially observed by robot sensors, as well as effective control using sparse control signals. In this work, we explore a more general problem: the manipulation of acoustic waves, which are partially observed by a robot capable of influencing the waves through spatially sparse actuators. This problem holds great potential for the design of new artificial materials, ultrasonic cutting tools, energy harvesting, and other applications. We develop an efficient data-driven method for robot learning that is applicable to either focusing scattered acoustic energy in a designated region or suppressing it, depending on the desired task. The proposed method is better in terms of a solution quality and computational complexity as compared to a state-of-the-art learning based method for manipulation of dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations. Furthermore our proposed method is competitive with a classical semi-analytical method in acoustics research on the demonstrated tasks. We have made the project code publicly available, along with a web page featuring video demonstrations: https://gladisor.github.io/waves/

### [Integrating Model-Based Control and RL for Sim2Real Transfer of Tight Insertion Policies]()

Object insertion under tight tolerances (< 1mm) is an important but challenging assembly task as even small errors can result in undesirable contacts. Recent efforts focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) often depends on careful definition of dense reward functions. This work proposes an effective strategy for such tasks that integrates traditional model-based control with RL to achieve improved insertion accuracy. The policy is trained exclusively in simulation and is zero-shot transferred to the real system. It employs a potential field-based controller to acquire a model-based policy for inserting a plug into a socket given full observability in simulation. This policy is then integrated with residual RL, which is trained in simulation given only a sparse, goal-reaching reward. A curriculum scheme over observation noise and action magnitude is used for training the residual RL policy. Both policy components use as input the SE(3) poses of both the plug and the socket and return the plug’s SE(3) pose transform, which is executed by a robotic arm using a controller. The integrated policy is deployed on the real system without further training or fine-tuning, given a visual SE(3) object tracker. The proposed solution and alternatives are evaluated across a variety of objects and conditions in simulation and reality. The proposed approach outperforms recent RL-based methods in this domain and prior efforts with hybrid policies. Ablations highlight the impact of each component of the approach.

### [Generative Graphical Inverse Kinematics]()

Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for many robot manipulators. Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned IK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize—a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations for a local optimization process.

### [GNSS/Multi-Sensor Fusion Using Continuous-Time Factor Graph Optimization for Robust Localization]()

Accurate and robust vehicle localization in highly urbanized areas is challenging. Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without strict state and measurement synchronization. We employed datasets frommeasurement campaigns in Aachen, Düsseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation indense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, our method results in a mean 2-D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in tight coupling.

### [Equivariant Filter for Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry]()

Pose estimation is a crucial problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the SE_2(3) group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state, and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.

### [Monocular Visual Place Recognition in LiDAR Maps Via Cross-Modal State Space Model and Multi-View Matching]()

Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/y2w-oc/I2P-CMPR.

### [Learning IMU Bias with Diffusion Model]()

Motion sensing and tracking with IMU data is essential for spatial intelligence, which however is challenging due to the presence of time-varying stochastic bias. IMU bias is affected by various factors such as temperature and vibration, making it highly complex and difficult to model analytically. Recent data-driven approaches using deep learning have shown promise in predicting bias from IMU readings. However, these methods often treat the task as a regression problem, overlooking the stochatic nature of bias. In contrast, we model bias, conditioned on IMU readings, as a probabilistic distribution and design a conditional diffusion model to approximate this distribution. Through this approach, we achieve improved performance and make predictions that align more closely with the known behavior of bias.

### [On Semidefinite Relaxations for Matrix-Weighted State-Estimation Problems in Robotics]()

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. To better understand this issue, we introduce a theoretical connection between the posterior uncertainty of the state estimate and the certificate matrix obtained via convex relaxation. With this connection in mind, we empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain it. As a second technical contribution of this paper, we show

### [Drift-Free Visual SLAM Using Digital Twins]()

Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.

### [TDFANet: Encoding Sequential 4D Radar Point Clouds Using Trajectory-Guided Deformable Feature Aggregation for Place Recognition]()

Place recognition is essential for achieving closed-loop or global positioning in autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features. Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated. Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments. Source codes are available.

### [HeLiOS: Heterogeneous LiDAR Place Recognition Via Overlap-Based Learning and Local Spherical Transformer]()

LiDAR place recognition is a crucial module in localization that matches the current location with previously observed environments. Most existing approaches in LiDAR place recognition dominantly focus on the spinning type LiDAR to exploit its large FOV for matching. However, with the recent emergence of various LiDAR types, the importance of matching data across different LiDAR types has grown significantly—a challenge that has been largely overlooked for many years. To address these challenges, we introduce HeLiOS, a deep network tailored for heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition, which utilizes small local windows with spherical transformers and optimal transport-based cluster assignment for robust global descriptors. Our overlap-based data mining and guided-triplet loss overcome the limitations of traditional distance-based mining and discrete class constraints. HeLiOS is validated on public datasets, demonstrating performance in heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition while including an evaluation for long-term recognition, showcasing its ability to handle unseen LiDAR types. We release the HeLiOS code as an open source for the robotics community at https://github.com/minwoo0611/HeLiOS.

### [InsCMPR: Efficient Cross-Modal Place Recognition Via Instance-Aware Hybrid Mamba-Transformer]()

Place recognition is an important technique for autonomous mobile robotic applications. While single-modal sensor-based approaches have shown satisfactory performance, cross-modal place recognition remains underexplored due to the challenge of bridging the cross-modal heterogeneity gap. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware cross-modal place recognition approach, named InsCMPR. We design a novel instance-aware modality alignment module, which aligns multi-modal data at both pixel-level and instance-level by leveraging a pre-trained vision foundation model SAM. Then a novel dual-branch hybrid Mamba-Transformer network is proposed to efficiently enhance the distinctiveness of the produced descriptors by integrating global features with local instance features. Experimental results on the KITTI, NCLT, and HAOMO datasets show that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while operating in real time. We will open source the implementation of our method at: https://github.com/nubot-nudt/InsCMPR.

### [Adaptive Thresholding for Sequence-Based Place Recognition]()

Robots need to know where they are in the world to operate effectively without human support. One common first step for precise robot localization is visual place recognition. It is a challenging problem, especially when the output is required in an online fashion, and the current state-of-the-art approaches that tackle it usually require either large amounts of labeled training data or rely on parameters that need to be tuned manually, often per dataset. One such parameter often used for sequence-based place recognition is the image similarity threshold that allows to differentiate between pairs of images that represent the same place even in the presence of severe environmental and structural changes, and those that represent different places even if they share a similar appearance. Currently, selecting this threshold is a manual procedure and requires human expertise. We propose an automatic similarity threshold selection technique and integrate it into a complete sequence-based place recognition system. The experiments on a broad range of real-world and simulated data show that our approach is capable of matching image sequences under various illumination, viewpoint and underlying structural changes, runs online, and requires no manual parameter tuning while yielding performance comparable to a manual, dataset-specific parameter tuning. Thus, this paper substantially increases the ease of use of visual place recognition in real-world settings.

### [RE-TRIP : Reflectivity Instance Augmented Triangle Descriptor for 3D Place Recognition]()

While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition (PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP in real-world applications, we further propose (1) keypoint extraction method, (2) key instance segmentation method, (3) RE-TRIP matching method, and (4) reflectivity combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios—including long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic environments—our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context, Intensity Scan Context and STD. Our code is available at : https://github.com/pyc5714/RE-TRIP.

### [Context Graph-Based Visual-Language Place Recognition]()

In vision-based robot localization and SLAM, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential. This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves accurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A popular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual features. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based on low-level visual features remains challenging in scenarios with changes in scene appearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed to overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features. However, these approaches still fail under drastic changes and require large amounts of labeled data for model training, presenting a significant limitation. To handle variations in appearance, methods that leverage high-level semantic information, such as objects or categories, have been introduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel VPR approach that does not require additional training and remains robust to scene changes. Our method constructs semantic image descriptors by extracting pixel-level embeddings from a zero-shot, languagedriven semantic segmentation model. We validate our approach in challenging place recognition scenarios using real-world public dataset. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms non-learned image representation techniques and offthe- shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptors. Our code is available at https://github.com/woo-soojin/ context-based-vlpr.git.

### [Marker or Markerless? Mode-Switchable Optical Tactile Sensing for Diverse Robot Tasks]()

Optical tactile sensors play a pivotal role in robot perception and manipulation tasks. The membrane of these sensors can be painted with markers or remain markerless, enabling them to function in either marker or markerless mode. However, this uni-modal selection means the sensor is only suitable for either manipulation or perception tasks. While markers are vital for manipulation, they can also obstruct the camera, thereby impeding perception. The dilemma of selecting between marker and markerless modes presents a significant obstacle. To address this issue, we propose a novel mode-switchable optical tactile sensing approach that facilitates transitions between the two modes. The marker-to-markerless transition is achieved through a generative model, whereas its inverse transition is realized using a sparsely supervised regressive model. Our approach allows a single-mode optical sensor to operate effectively in both marker and markerless modes without the need for additional hardware, making it well-suited for both perception and manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. For perception tasks, our approach decreases the number of categories that include misclassified samples by 2 and improves contact area segmentation IoU by 3.53%. For manipulation tasks, our method attains a high success rate of 92.59% in slip detection. Code, dataset and demo videos are available at the project website https://gitouni.github.io/Marker-Markerless-Transition/

### [Self-Mixing Laser Interferometry for Robotic Tactile Sensing]()

Self-mixing interferometry (SMI) has been lauded for its sensitivity in detecting microvibrations, while requiring no physical contact with its target. In robotics, microvibrations have traditionally been interpreted as a marker for object slip, and recently as a salient indicator of extrinsic contact. We present the first-ever robotic fingertip making use of SMI for slip and extrinsic contact sensing. The design is validated through measurement of controlled vibration sources, both before and after encasing the readout circuit in its fingertip package. Then, the SMI fingertip is compared to acoustic sensing through four experiments. The results are distilled into a technology decision map. SMI was found to be more sensitive to subtle slip events and significantly more resilient against ambient noise. We conclude that the integration of SMI in robotic fingertips offers a new, promising branch of tactile sensing in robotics. Design and data files are available at https://github.com/RemkoPr/icra2025-SMI-tactile-sensing.

### [Estimating High-Resolution Neural Stiffness Fields Using Visuotactile Sensors]()

High-resolution visuotactile sensors provide detailed contact information that is promising to infer the physical properties of objects in contact. This paper introduces a novel technique for high-resolution stiffness estimation of heterogeneous deformable objects using the Punyo bubble sensor. We developed an observation model for dense contact forces to estimate object stiffness using a visuotactile sensor and a dense force estimator. Additionally, we propose a neural volumetric stiffness field (VSF) formulation that represents stiffness as a continuous function, which allows dynamic point sampling at visuotactile sensor observation resolution. The neural VSF significantly reduces artifacts commonly associated with traditional point-based methods, particularly in stiff inclusion estimation and heterogeneous stiffness estimation. We further apply our method in a blind localization task, where objects within opaque bags are accurately modeled and localized, demonstrating the superior performance of neural VSF compared to existing techniques.

### [High-Resolution Reconstruction of Non-Planar Tactile Patterns from Low-Resolution Taxel-Based Tactile Sensors]()

Over the past decades, the development of tactile sensors has gained increasing attention and has gradually become a fundamental device for robots. Especially in today's context where human-robot interaction demands are growing and the requirements for tactile perception are becoming stricter, how to enable robots to better perceive their environment has become a topic worth discussing. Tactile sensors, after years of development, have emerged in two main types: taxel-based and vision-based sensors, where the latter can provide relatively low resolution (LR) tactile patterns compared with the former. Both of them have seen significant enhancements in their tactile perception capabilities on flat and regular surfaces. However, as application scenarios expand, current flat tactile perception can no longer meet the robots' needs for multi-dimensional and complex perception capabilities. Therefore, we investigate the high-resolution (HR) reconstruction of non-planar tactile patterns captured by LR taxel-based sensors in this paper. We first develop a new dataset, where the ground truth of non-planar tactile patterns are obtained with a vision-based GelSight Mini tactile sensor, and the LR data are collected via a commercial taxel-based Xela sensor. In addition, we propose to adapt the state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based tactile super-resolution model of flat/planar surfaces to the non-planar scenario, and also develop a diffusion-based model for the non-planar HR reconstruction. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed models.

### [Blind Tactile Exploration for Surface Reconstruction]()

Accurate 3d reconstruction capturing the fine details of an object’s shape is essential for tasks such as automated assembly, inspection, and quality control. While monocular cameras provide broad visual structure but often miss critical surface details and depth accuracy in underexposed or occluded environments. Tactile sensors offer precise, localized depth information, capturing fine textures, yet exploring varied curvature surfaces with only tactile input remains challenging. To address this, the paper proposes a blind surface exploration method for convex objects using a set of sequential controllers to efficiently guide the manipulator's interaction with surfaces featuring sharp edge changes. This approach ensures precise tactile exploration, leading to highly detailed surface reconstruction. With the controller employed, the algorithm was able to move along the surface while maintaining contact along normal and reconstruct the object with IoU as high as 91% for objects with sharp edges.

### [Graph-Structured Super-Resolution for Geometry-Generalized Tomographic Tactile Sensing: Application to Humanoid Faces]()

Electrical impedance tomographic (EIT) tactile sensing holds great promise for whole-body coverage of contact-rich robotic systems, offering extensive flexibility in sensor geometry. However, low spatial resolution restricts its practical use, despite the existing deep-learning-based reconstruction methods. This study introduces EIT-GNN, a graph-structured data-driven EIT reconstruction framework that achieves super-resolution in large-area tactile perception on unbounded form factors of robots. EIT-GNN represents the arbitrary sensor shape into mesh connections, then employs a two-fold architecture of transformer encoder and graph convolutional neural network to best manage such the geometrical prior knowledge, resulting in the accurate, generalized, and parameter-efficient reconstruction procedure. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate its application using large-area face-shaped sensor hardware, which represents one of the most complex geometries in human/humanoid anatomy. An extensive set of experiments, including simulation study, ablation analysis, single-touch indentation test, and latent feature analysis, confirm its superiority over alternative models. The beneficial features of the approach are demonstrated through its application in active tactile-servo control of humanoid head motion, paving the new way for integrating tactile sensors with intricate designs into robotic systems.

### [Control Reallocation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Actuator Fault Recovery of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle]()

Actuator faults in dynamic systems pose significant challenges, particularly for robotic systems operating in hostile environments such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), risking loss of stability and performance degradation. Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) strategies, including Control Reallocation (CR), have been developed to mitigate such risks. However, these strategies extensively depend on explicit fault diagnosis, which may present challenges regarding computational demands and efficiency, particularly when dealing with unknown faults. This paper presents a novel method that performs CR with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for actuator fault recovery without explicit fault diagnosis. The approach is implemented on a BlueROV2 underwater vehicle and demonstrates improved performance for fault recovery compared to a standard Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and a variable gain PID controller, both in simulation and in real-world conditions. The DRL-based CR method demonstrates generalisability by successfully handling faults not encountered during training, highlighting its adaptability to unforeseen circumstances.

### [A New Framework for Repetitive Control of Robot Manipulators Via Operator-Theoretic Robust Stabilization]()

This paper establishes a new framework for repetitive control of uncertain robot manipulators via operator-theoretic robust stabilization. After applying the inverse dynamics approach to robot manipulators, by which the relevant nonlinear inputslash output behavior is converted to a linear time-invariant (LTI) equation, we take the repetitive control approach. Even though such a repetitive controller is known to achieve high performances for periodic reference inputs, it is quite difficult to derive the stability analysis for the resulting closed-loop systems in a rigorous fashion. To solve this difficulty, we construct an operator-theoretic approach to the repetitive control treatment, and show that the closed-loop systems are exponentially stable if and only if the spectrum radius of the relevant monodromy operator is less than 1. Based on the necessary and sufficient condition, we develop a guideline to take the relevant control parameters. Finally, some experiment results are given to demonstrate the overall arguments developed in this paper.

### [Learning Robust Policies Via Interpretable Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability-Guided Disturbances]()

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in robotics with complex and heterogeneous dynamics. However, its vulnerability to unknown disturbances and adversarial attacks remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a robust policy training framework that integrates model-based control principles with adversarial RL training to improve robustness without the need for external black-box adversaries. Our approach introduces a novel Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-guided disturbance for adversarial RL training, where we use interpretable worst-case or near-worst-case disturbances as adversaries against the robust policy. We evaluated its effectiveness across three distinct tasks: a reach-avoid game in both simulation and real-world settings, and a highly dynamic quadrotor stabilization task in simulation. We validate that our learned critic network is consistent with the ground-truth HJ value function, while the policy network shows comparable performance with other learning-based methods.

### [Optimal Fault-Tolerant Control for Tugboats Robust Path Following in Nearshore]()

External ocean disturbances (EODs) and internal thruster loss-of-effectiveness faults (ITLEFs) are key factors influencing the accuracy of the autonomous tugboat's path following, as well as the stability and safety of the tugboat's hull during maritime operations. To achieve robust path following for the autonomous tugboat, this paper proposes an optimal fault-tolerant control scheme. Firstly, we formulate the robust path following of the tugboat as an optimal fault-tolerance control problem. A matrixed error system for the control scheme is constructed to uniformly consider both EODs and ITLEFs. Secondly, considering the time and economic costs associated with algorithm deployment and tuning process on tugboats in real world, we present an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm to solve the proposed optimal fault-tolerance problem, which is characterized by ease of tuning. Then, the stability of the control system is proven based on the Lyapunov criterion. Finally, the proposed control scheme is evaluated under practical conditions with EODs and ITLEFs. The comparative results with backstepping-based control scheme demonstrate that the proposed control scheme exhibits more robustness for path following under EODs and ITLEFs.

### [Neural L1 Adaptive Control of Vehicle Lateral Dynamics]()

We address the problem of stable and robust control of vehicles with lateral error dynamics for the application of lane keeping. Lane departure is the primary reason for half of the fatalities in road accidents, making the development of stable, adaptive and robust controllers a necessity. Traditional linear feedback controllers achieve satisfactory tracking performance, however, they exhibit unstable behavior when uncertainties are induced into the system. Any disturbance or uncertainty introduced to the steering-angle input can be catastrophic for the vehicle. Therefore, controllers must be developed to actively handle such uncertainties. In this work, we introduce a Neural L1 Adaptive controller which learns the uncertainties in the lateral error dynamics of a front-steered Ackermann vehicle and guarantees stability and robustness. Our contributions are threefold: i) We extend the theoretical results for guaranteed stability and robustness of conventional L1 Adaptive controllers to Neural L1 Adaptive controller; ii) We implement a Neural L1 Adaptive controller for the lane keeping application which learns uncertainties in the dynamics accurately; iii) We evaluate the performance of Neural L1 Adaptive controller on a physics-based simulator, PyBullet, and conduct extensive real-world experiments with the F1TENTH platform to demonstrate superior reference trajectory tracking performance of Neural L1 Adaptive controller compared to other state-of-the-art controllers, in the presence of uncertainties.

### [Mechanical Design and Data-Enabled Predictive Control of a Planar Soft Robot]()

Soft robots offer a unique combination of flexibility, adaptability, and safety, making them well-suited for a diverse range of applications. However, the inherent complexity of soft robots poses great challenges in their modeling and control. In this paper, we present the mechanical design and data-driven control of a pneumatic-driven soft planar robot. Specifically, we employ a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) strategy that directly utilizes system input/output data to achieve safe and optimal control, eliminating the need for tedious system identification or modeling. In addition, a dimension reduction technique is introduced into the DeePC framework, resulting in significantly enhanced computational efficiencywith minimal to no degradation in control performance. Comparative experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of DeePC in the control of the fabricated soft robot.

### [Efficient Imitation without Demonstrations Via Value-Penalized Auxiliary Control from Examples]()

Common approaches to providing feedback in reinforcement learning are the use of hand-crafted rewards or full-trajectory expert demonstrations. Alternatively, one can use examples of completed tasks, but such an approach can be extremely sample inefficient. We introduce value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE), an algorithm that significantly improves exploration in example-based control by adding examples of simple auxiliary tasks and an above-success level value penalty. Across both simulated and real robotic environments, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency for challenging tasks, while maintaining bounded value estimates. Preliminary results also suggest that VPACE may learn more efficiently than the more common approaches of using full trajectories or true sparse rewards.

### [QuasiNav: Asymmetric Cost-Aware Navigation Planning with Constrained Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning]()

Autonomous navigation in unstructured outdoor environments is inherently challenging due to the presence of asymmetric traversal costs, such as varying energy expenditures for uphill versus downhill movement. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often assume symmetric costs, which can lead to suboptimal navigation paths and increased safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce QuasiNav, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates quasimetric embeddings to explicitly model asymmetric costs and guide efficient, safe navigation. QuasiNav formulates the navigation problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and employs quasimetric embeddings to capture directionally dependent costs, allowing for a more accurate representation of the terrain. We combine this approach with adaptive constraint tightening. This ensures that safety constraints are dynamically enforced during learning. We validate QuasiNav on a Clearpath Jackal robot in three challenging navigation scenarios—undulating terrains, asymmetric hill traversal, and directionally dependent terrain traversal—demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results show that QuasiNav significantly outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher success rates, improved energy efficiency (13.6% reduction in energy consumption compared to baseline methods), and better adherence to safety constraints.

### [Learning a High-Quality Robotic Wiping Policy Using Systematic Reward Analysis and Visual-Language Model Based Curriculum]()

Autonomous robotic wiping is an important task in various industries, ranging from industrial manufacturing to sanitization in healthcare. Deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has emerged as a promising algorithm, however, it often suffers from a high demand for repetitive reward engineering. Instead of relying on manual tuning, we first analyze the convergence of quality-critical robotic wiping, which requires both high-quality wiping and fast task completion, to show the poor convergence of the problem and propose a new bounded reward formulation to make the problem feasible. Then, we further improve the learning process by proposing a novel visual-language model (VLM) based curriculum, which actively monitors the progress and suggests hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that the combined method can find a desirable wiping policy on surfaces with various curvatures, frictions, and waypoints, which cannot be learned with the baseline formulation. The demo of this project can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/highqualitywiping

### [Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensation to Model Predictive Control for Off-Road Autonomous Vehicles under Unknown Dynamics]()

This study presents an Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC3MPC) designed to address unknown system dynamics. To avoid the difficulty of modeling highly complex dynamics and ensuring real-time control feasibility and performance, this work uses deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller in a cooperative framework to handle unknown dynamics. The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%. This framework generalized well over varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics to track longitudinal reference speeds with lower errors. Furthermore, this required significantly less training data compared to purely learning-based controller, while delivering better performance even when under-trained.

### [Soft Actor-Critic-Based Control Barrier Adaptation for Robust Autonomous Navigation in Unknown Environments]()

Motion planning failures during autonomous navigation often occur when safety constraints are either too conservative, leading to deadlocks, or too liberal, resulting in collisions. To improve robustness, a robot must dynamically adapt its safety constraints to ensure it reaches its goal while balancing safety and performance measures. To this end, we propose a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based model for adapting Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraint parameters at runtime, ensuring safe yet non-conservative motion. The proposed approach is designed for a general high-level motion planner, low-level controller, and target system model, and is trained in simulation only. Through extensive simulations and physical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework effectively adapts CBF constraints, enabling the robot to reach its final goal without compromising safety.

### [Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotors]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness in quadrotor control, enabling specialized policies to develop outstanding, even human-level, performance in single-task scenarios. However, these specialized policies often struggle with novel tasks, requiring a complete retraining of the policy from scratch. This limitation is particularly challenging in various real-world applications such as search and rescue or infrastructure inspection, where quick and efficient adaptation to diverse tasks is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) framework for multiple quadrotor control tasks. Quadrotor control tasks have fundamental similarities based on the consistent physical properties and dynamics of the platform itself. We leverage these similarities and propose an MTRL approach based on an efficient knowledge-sharing framework. Our approach significantly improves the sample efficiency compared to learning tasks individually without compromising task performance. As a result, our approach produces a single high-performance policy capable of executing complex maneuvers such as stabilizing from high speed, velocity tracking, and autonomous racing. Our experimental results, validated both in simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline approaches in terms of sample efficiency and overall task performance.

### [Watch Your STEPP: Semantic Traversability Estimation Using Pose Projected Features]()

Understanding the traversability of terrain is essential for autonomous robot navigation, particularly in unstructured environments such as natural landscapes. Although traditional methods, such as occupancy mapping, provide a basic framework, they often fail to account for the complex mobility capabilities of some platforms such as legged robots. In this work, we propose a method for estimating terrain traversability by learning from demonstrations of human walking. Our approach leverages dense, pixel-wise feature embeddings generated using the DINOv2 vision Transformer model, which are processed through an encoder-decoder MLP architecture to analyze terrain segments. The averaged feature vectors, extracted from the masked regions of interest, are used to train the model in a reconstruction-based framework. By minimizing reconstruction loss, the network distinguishes between familiar terrain with a low reconstruction error and unfamiliar or hazardous terrain with a higher reconstruction error. This approach facilitates the detection of anomalies, allowing a legged robot to navigate more effectively through challenging terrain. We run real-world experiments on the ANYmal legged robot both indoor and outdoor to prove our proposed method. The code is open-source, while video demonstrations can be found on our website: https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/STEPP

### [GND: Global Navigation Dataset with Multi-Modal Perception and Multi-Category Traversability in Outdoor Campus Environments]()

Navigating large-scale outdoor environments, e.g., university campuses, requires complex reasoning in terms of geometric structures, environmental semantics, and terrain characteristics using onboard sensors like LiDARs and cameras. Although existing mobile robots can navigate such environments using pre-defined, high-precision maps based on hand-crafted rules catered for every environment, they lack commonsense reasoning capabilities that most humans possess when navigating unknown outdoor spaces. To equip robots with such capabilities, we propose a large-scale Global Navigation Dataset, GND, which incorporates multi-modal sensory data (3D LiDAR point clouds and RGB and 360textdegree~images) and multi-category traversability maps (pedestrian walkways, vehicle roadways, stairs, off-road terrain, and obstacles) from ten university campuses. We also present a set of novel use cases of GND to showcase its utility to enable global robot navigation. GND's website can be found at https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/Research/GND/.

### [VLM-GroNav: Robot Navigation Using Physically Grounded Vision-Language Models in Outdoor Environments]()

We present a novel autonomous robot navigation algorithm for outdoor environments that is capable of handling diverse terrain traversability conditions. Our approach, VLM-GroNav, uses vision-language models (VLMs) and integrates them with physical grounding that is used to assess intrinsic terrain properties such as deformability and slipperiness. We use proprioceptive-based sensing, which provides direct measurements of these physical properties, and enhances the overall semantic understanding of the terrains. Our formulation uses in-context learning to ground the VLM’s semantic understanding with proprioceptive data to allow dynamic updates of traversability estimates based on the robot’s real-time physical interactions with the environment. We use the updated traversability estimations to inform both the local and global planners for real-time trajectory replanning. We validate our method on a legged robot (Ghost Vision 60) and a wheeled robot (Clearpath Husky), in diverse real-world outdoor environments with different deformable and slippery terrains. In practice, we observe significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods by up to 50% increase in navigation success rate.

### [TANGO: Traversability-Aware Navigation with Local Metric Control for Topological Goals]()

Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate towards object-level subgoals while avoiding obstacles. We address key limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory rollout using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is made publicly available: url{https://github.com/podgorki/TANGO}.

### [NavFormer: A Transformer Architecture for Robot Target-Driven Navigation in Unknown and Dynamic Environments]()

In unknown cluttered and dynamic environments such as disaster scenes, mobile robots need to perform target-driven navigation in order to find people or objects of interest, where the only information provided about these targets are images of the individual targets. In this paper, we introduce NavFormer, a novel end-to-end transformer architecture developed for robot target-driven navigation in unknown and dynamic environments. NavFormer leverages the strengths of both 1) transformers for sequential data processing and 2) self-supervised learning (SSL) for visual representation to reason about spatial layouts and to perform collision-avoidance in dynamic settings. The architecture uniquely combines dual-visual encoders consisting of a static encoder for extracting invariant environment features for spatial reasoning, and a general encoder for dynamic obstacle avoidance. The primary robot navigation task is decomposed into two sub-tasks for training: single robot exploration and multi-robot collision avoidance. We perform cross-task training to enable the transfer of learned skills to the complex primary navigation task. Simulated experiments demonstrate that NavFormer can effectively navigate a mobile robot in diverse unknown environments, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. A comprehensive ablation study is performed to evaluate the impact of the main design choices of NavFormer. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the generalizability of NavFormer.

### [Learning Semantic Traversability with Egocentric Video and Automated Annotation Strategy]()

For reliable autonomous robot navigation in urban settings, the robot must have the ability to identify semantically traversable terrains in the image based on the semantic understanding of the scene. This reasoning ability is based on semantic traversability, which is frequently achieved using semantic segmentation models fine-tuned on the testing domain. This fine-tuning process often involves manual data collection with the target robot and annotation by human labelers whichis prohibitively expensive and unscalable. In this work, we present an effective methodology for training a semantic traversability estimator using egocentric videos and an automated annotation process. Egocentricvideos are collected from a camera mounted on a pedestrian's chest. Thedataset for training the semantic traversability estimator is then automatically generated by extracting semantically traversable regions in each video frame using a recent foundation model in image segmentation and its prompting technique. Extensive experiments with videos taken across several countries and cities, covering diverse urban scenarios, demonstrate the high scalability and generalizability of the proposed annotation method. Furthermore, performance analysis and real-world deployment for autonomous robot navigation showcase thatthe trained semantic traversability estimator is highly accurate, able to handle diverse camera viewpoints, computationally light, and real-world applicable. The summary video is available at https://youtu.be/EUVoH-wA-lA.

### [Categorical Traffic Transformer: Interpretable and Diverse Behavior Prediction with Tokenized Latent]()

Adept traffic models are critical to both real-time prediction/planning and closed-loop simulation for autonomous vehicles (AV). Key design objectives include accuracy, diverse multimodal behaviors, interpretability, and compatibility with other modules in the autonomy stack, e.g., the downstream planner. We present Categorical Traffic Transformer (CTT), a traffic model that outputs both continuous trajectory predictions and categorical predictions with clear semantic meanings (lane modes, homotopies, etc.). The most outstanding feature of CTT is its fully interpretable latent space, which enables direct supervision of the latent variables from the ground truth during training and avoids mode collapse completely. As a result, CTT can generate diverse behaviors conditioned on different semantic modes while significantly beating SOTA on prediction accuracy. In addition, CTT's ability to input and output tokens enables direct integration with semantic-heavy modules such as behavior planners and language models, bridging the tokenized representation and the continuous trajectory space.

### [LACNS: Language-Assisted Continuous Navigation in Structured Spaces]()

Current autonomous driving technology typically relies on high-precision (HD) maps to ensure safe, reliable, and accurate navigation in urban environments. While these maps provide essential road information, their creation and maintenance are costly, limiting their widespread application. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a novel system, Language-Assisted Continuous Navigation in Structured Spaces (LACNS). LACNS facilitates autonomous driving without the need for HD maps by integrating vehicle-centric local perception with real-time language commands from map software or human navigators. LACNS begins by generating a BEV map using the vehicle's front-facing camera. Simultaneously, a pre-trained Visual Language Model (VLM) detects intersections from the camera images, assigning a score to each. Road elements are then extracted from the BEV map and combined with the intersection scores to identify potential navigation frontiers. Language instructions, processed by a pre-trained Large Language Model(LLM), are used to select the most suitable frontier. Finally, the chosen frontier and BEV map are employed to plan a safe route and control the vehicle's movement. We evaluated LACNS using the Carla simulator to validate its navigation capabilities in continuous spaces. Initial tests involved navigating through four intersections with varying directional commands, where LACNS demonstrated high and consistent success rates across multiple trials. Further simulations in real-time navigation scenarios revealed that LACNS consistently maintained a high success rate across three progressively challenging routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our novel HD map-independent autonomous driving navigation method.

### [Decentralized Vehicle Coordination: The Berkeley DeepDrive Drone Dataset and Consensus-Based Models]()

A significant portion of roads, particularly in densely populated developing countries, lacks explicitly defined right-of-way rules. These understructured roads pose substantial challenges for autonomous vehicle motion planning, where efficient and safe navigation relies on understanding decentralized human coordination for collision avoidance. This coordination, often termed "social driving etiquette," remains underexplored due to limited open-source empirical data and suitable modeling frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel dataset and modeling framework designed to study motion planning in these understructured environments. The dataset includes 20 aerial videos of representative scenarios, an image dataset for training vehicle detection models, and a development kit for vehicle trajectory estimation. We demonstrate that a consensus-based modeling approach can effectively explain the emergence of priority orders observed in our dataset, and is therefore a viable framework for decentralized collision avoidance planning.

### [CANVAS: Commonsense-Aware Navigation System for Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction]()

Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.

### [BETTY Dataset: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Full-Stack Autonomy]()

We present the BETTY dataset, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset collected on several autonomous racing vehicles, targeting supervised and self-supervised state estimation, dynamics modeling, motion forecasting, perception, and more. Existing large-scale datasets, especially autonomous vehicle datasets, focus primarily on supervised perception, planning, and motion forecasting tasks. Our work enables multi-modal, data-driven methods by including all sensor inputs and the outputs from the software stack, along with semantic metadata and ground truth information. The dataset encompasses 4 years of data, currently comprising of over 13 hours and 32 TB, collected on autonomous racing vehicle platforms. This data spans 6 diverse racing environments, including high-speed oval courses, for single and multi-agent algorithm evaluation in feature-sparse scenarios, as well as high-speed road courses with high longitudinal and lateral accelerations and tight, GPS-denied environments. It captures highly dynamic states, such as 63 m/s crashes, loss of tire traction, and operation at the limit of stability. By offering a large breadth of cross-modal and dynamic data, the BETTY dataset enables the training and testing of full autonomy stack pipelines, pushing the performance of all algorithms to the limits. The current dataset is available at https://pitt-mit-iac.github.io/betty-dataset/.

This work proposes a robust and fast navigation system in a narrow indoor environment for UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) using 2D LiDAR. We used behavior cloning with Transformer neural network to learn the optimization-based baseline algorithm. We inject Gaussian noise during expert demonstration to increase the robustness of the learned policy and evaluate the performance of LiCS using both simulation and hardware experiments. It outperforms all other baselines in terms of navigation performance, achieving a success rate 100% in highly cluttered simulated environments. During the hardware experiments, LiCS can maintain safe navigation at maximum speed of 1.5 m/s.

This paper brings the concept of neuroergonomic workcell with its essential components (psychological and physical assessment, non-physical, physical and strategic support) for improving the well-being and productivity of workers at their workplaces. A proof-of-concept neuroergonomic human-centered workstation is demonstrated in a real factory environment for a typical industrial laborious task - assembly. The pilot workstation introduces a fully portable, non-invasive EEG-based users’ mental workload assessment, a non-obtrusive human-machine interface, illustrative graphical assembly guidelines, a cobot assistant, and an intelligent task scheduler. The subjects’ performance and workload were assessed using a NASA-TLX questionnaire, three EEG workload indices, hand gesture detection accuracy, number of errors, and task duration. We identified a notable correlation between multiple EEG indices of workload and NASA score results. The new workstation boosts productivity with better performance and fewer errors on the assembly line while reducing mental demand. Its modular design ensures easy integration and adaptation into factory settings, optimizing manual assembly processes.

### [Remote Extended Reality with Markerless Motion Tracking for Sitting Posture Training]()

Dynamic postural control during sitting is essential for functional mobility and daily activities. Extended reality (XR) presents a promising solution for posture training in addressing conventional training limitations related to patient accessibility and ecological validity. We developed a remote XR rehabilitation system with markerless motion tracking for sitting posture training. Forty-two healthy subjects participated in this proof-of-concept pilot study. Each subject completed 24 rounds of multi-directional reach tasks using the system and 24 rounds without it. Motion data were collected via online meetings using built-in camera in the user's laptop. Functional reach test scores were analyzed to assess the impact of the system on motor performance. Four standard questionnaires were used to assess the effects of this system on presence, simulator sickness, engagement, and enjoyment. Our results indicate that the remote XR training system significantly improved functional reach performance and proved highly effective for telerehabilitation. XR interaction also enhanced training engagement and enjoyment. By bridging the spatial gap between patients and therapists, this system enables personalized and engaging home-based intervention. Additionally, it facilitates more natural movements by eliminating body marker constraints and laboratory limitations. This study should serve as a stepping stone to advancing novel remote XR rehabilitation systems.

### [Error-Subspace Transform Kalman Filter Based Real-Time Gait Prediction for Rehabilitation Exoskeletons]()

With the rapid development of rehabilitation robotics, there is a pressing need for efficient and accurate gait prediction methods. However, due to the complexity and variability of individual gait characteristics and external disturbances, accurately predicting gait in real time remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an innovative Bayesian-inference-based method for real-time gait prediction while a subject walks with a lower-limb exoskeleton. Periodic gait information is represented using von Mises basis functions, and the weight parameters serve as real-time updated state variables. The error-subspace transform Kalman filter (ESTKF) is applied for gait trajectory prediction. A fully connected neural network (FCNN) is used to estimate the walking speeds in real time based on predicted trajectories. Comparative experiments based on an open-source database prove the advantages of ESKTF compared with other Bayesian filters. Walking experiments are conducted to estimate phase and speed in real time, and to predict the joint angle, total joint torque, and lower-limb muscle surface electromyography (sEMG) values. Experimental results validate the method’s prediction performance across different speeds and demonstrate its resilience to external interference.

### [A Comparative Study of Pulley and Bowden Transmissions in a Novel Cable-Driven Exosuit, the Stillsuit]()

Cable-driven exosuits assist users in ambulatory activities by transmitting assistive torques from motors to the actuated joints. State-of-the-art exosuits typically use Bowden cable transmissions, albeit their limited efficiencies (40–60%) and non-linear response in curved paths. This paper evaluates the efficiency and responsiveness of a new cable-pulley transmission compared to a Bowden transmission, using both steel and Dyneema cables. The analysis includes three experiments: a test bench simulating a curved transmission path, followed by a static and dynamic experiment where six unimpaired participants donned an exosuit featuring both transmissions across the hips and knees. Our findings demonstrate that the pulley transmission consistently outperformed the Bowden’s efficiency by absolute margins of 18.77 ± 7.29% using a steel cable and by 40.60 ± 6.76% using a Dyneema cable across all experiments. Additionally, the steel cable was on average 19.19 ± 5.29% more efficient than the Dyneema cable in the pulley transmission and 41.02 ± 6.34% in the Bowden tube. These results led to the development of the Stillsuit, a novel lower-limb cable-driven exosuit that uses a pulley transmission and steel cable. The Stillsuit sets a new benchmark for exosuits with 87.56 ± 3.92% transmission efficiency, generating similar biological torques to those found in literature (16.4% and 19.0% of the biological knee and hip torques, respectively) while using smaller motors, resulting in a lighter actuation unit (1.92 kg).

### [Rapid Online Learning of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Preferences]()

Hip exoskeletons are increasing in popularity due to their effectiveness across various scenarios and their ability to adapt to different users. However, personalizing the assistance often requires lengthy tuning procedures and computationally intensive algorithms, and most existing methods do not incorporate user feedback. In this work, we propose a novel approach for rapidly learning users' preferences for hip exoskeleton assistance. We perform pairwise comparisons of distinct randomly generated assistive profiles, and collect participants preferences through active querying. Users' feedback is integrated into a preference-learning algorithm that updates its belief, learns a user-dependent reward function, and changes the assistive torque profiles accordingly. Results from eight healthy subjects display distinct preferred torque profiles, and users' choices remain consistent when compared to a perturbed profile. A comprehensive evaluation of users' preferences reveals a close relationship with individual walking strategies. The tested torque profiles do not disrupt kinematic joint synergies, and participants favor assistive torques that are synchronized with their movements, resulting in lower negative power from the device. This straightforward approach enables the rapid learning of users preferences and rewards, grounding future studies on reward-based human-exoskeleton interaction.

### [A Human-In-The-Loop Simulation Framework for Evaluating Control Strategies in Gait Assistive Robots]()

As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presents a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait-assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporate a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speed-adaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assess the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and reveal discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken and their effect on the human's gait. This work provides valuable insights into optimizing and evaluating system parameters, emphasizing the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.

### [Voice Control in Mobile Home Assistive Robots for Older Adults with MCI]()

Assistive technologies for home environments is a growing field. The wide availability of voice assistants that allow people to complete tasks in a “hands-busy, eyes-busy” manner is especially useful for people who have trouble using computers and smartphones. As robotic platforms advance and become more affordable, they are expected to make a similar impact, supporting people with tasks that require a physical embodiment. While both of these technological components show great potential to alleviate the burden of certain at-home tasks, there are technical and usability-related challenges that need to be explored in order to develop and deploy them so populations that need the most assistance in the shortest timelines can benefit. Older adults, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), may be more likely to benefit from voice as an input and the physical capabilities of home robots, but less able or willing to learn and reliably use the input structures required to successfully interact with them. In this research, we equip a Hello Robot Stretch with a voice control interface and explore older adults’ responses to the robot’s completion of various tasks. We analyze the results of a formative survey involving videos of the interface and discuss future plans for a between-subject study to compare different voice command structures.

### [Late Breaking Results on Generation of Metric-Semantic Scene Graphs with Factors Based on Graph Neural Networks]()

Robots can improve their environmental reasoning by identifying high-level spatial concepts like rooms and walls from observable planes. These concepts enhance:​ - Geometrical consistency in mapping [1], - Situational awareness in complex environments [2,3],​ - Explainability through human-aligned knowledge [4].​ - Richer input for tasks like planning[5]. Current SLAM systems rely on ad-hoc methods for detecting and defining spatial concepts, limiting the recognition of complex structures.

### [Beyond Violation Types: The Influence of Dispositional Trust on Human-Robot Collaboration after Trust Violations]()

Robots, like humans, make mistakes that undermine trust, potentially threatening successful collaboration in human-robot teams. Our lab study evaluates three trust repair strategies -- apology, denial, and compensation -- following two types of trust violations -- competence-based and integrity-based. Results show that integrity-based violations cause greater damage to trust and social perception of the robot than competence-based violations, leading to reduced collaboration. This underlines the importance of prioritizing the resolution of integrity-based violations in a robot’s programming, as competence-based violations may be more easily overlooked by users. Building on findings from our previous research, dispositional trust significantly influenced the effectiveness of repair strategies, whereas trust violation types did not. Notably, denial was the most effective strategy for repairing performance trust among individuals with high dispositional trust, while apologies were most effective for repairing honesty trust in individuals with low dispositional trust. These combined results highlight the importance for adaptive trust repair approaches that account for individual human differences, rather than violation types, to foster successful human-robot collaboration continuance.

### [Compute Reliability Maps and Optimize Reliable Workspace for Redundant Robots Experiencing Locked Joint Failures​ ​]()

Robot’s failure tolerant workspace is defined as the reachable workspace both before and after an arbitrary joint is locked at an arbitrary angle during a motion. Once the task is located within the failure-tolerant workspace, task completion can be easily guaranteed, and only a simple failure-recovery strategy is needed to complete the remaining path. The existing methods for computing and optimizing failure-tolerant workspace have the following limitations. First, these methods can only be used to compute the 3D positional failure-tolerant workspace, but not the 3D orientational failure-tolerant workspace. Second, all the existing studies optimized the failure-tolerant workspace only considering its volume, where other morphological features of the failure-tolerant workspace are completely ignored. To address these limitations, this work develops a method to compute the 6D reliability map based on the joint failure probabilities and then optimize the reliable workspace of a robot considering its shape and size. The main contributions of this work are as follows: (1) The concept of reliability maps is introduced to show the reliability of various regions within the workspace. (2) A computationally efficient method is developed to compute the 6D reliability map, including both position and orientation workspace. (3) A new metric is proposed to evaluate and optimize the computed reliable workspace, considering both its volume and connectivity.

### [FACETS: Efficient Constrained Iterative NAS for Object Detection in Robotic Perception]()

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for object detection frameworks typically involves multiple interdependent modules, contributing to a vast search space and high computational cost. Joint optimization across modules is both challenging and expensive, especially under device-specific constraints. We propose FACETS—eFficient Architecture Search for Constrained itEraTive Search—a unified NAS approach that refines all modules iteratively. FACETS alternates between fixing one module’s architecture and optimizing the others, leveraging feedback across cycles to reduce the search space while maintaining inter-module dependencies. This strategy allows FACETS to satisfy computational constraints and reach high-quality solutions more efficiently. In experiments, FACETS finds architectures with up to 4.75% higher accuracy twice as fast as progressive methods and yields a refined search space with candidates up to 27% more accurate than global search and 5% over progressive search via random sampling. Its generality and efficiency make FACETS especially promising for real-time, resource-constrained robotic perception systems across diverse platforms.

### [Multiple Sensors Based Perception and Limitation for Autonomous Ships]()

With advances in probabilistic inference, AI, and high-performance computing, autonomous navigation has made great strides. Yet, ships remain uniquely challenged by dynamic ocean environments and long offshore operations. These conditions place high demands on maritime situational awareness systems, which must ensure robust object detection and tracking while remaining cost-effective. This paper presents a multi-object tracking system specifically designed for autonomous ships, grounded in a deep understanding of their distinctive operational characteristics. The proposed architecture integrates multiple detection and navigation sensors with an AI-based perception algorithm and a probabilistic data fusion framework. With modularity and scalability at its core, the system processes sensor data through two specialized stages to ensure optimal performance. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through real-world trials under realistic maritime conditions. Beyond system performance, this study highlights the limitations of relying solely on local awareness systems in commercial maritime operations. It underscores the necessity for a standardized, systematic approach to generating and sharing positional data among vessels—via Next-Generation AIS and inter-ship communication. Drawing inspiration from structured environments in robotics, we suggest that such an approach offers a practical path to balancing operational safety with economic viability.

The UAV collects bearing measurements at each waypoint and predicts future waypoints to minimize localization uncertainty and total mission time. The algorithm accounts for constraints such as communication range and maintaining a safe distance from animals to reduce disturbance. Performance is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, measuring uncertainty reduction, localization accuracy, and mission time. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of our method for fast and precise multi-target tracking under field conditions. This work contributes to the field of autonomous UAV operations, offering valuable insights into efficient robotic path planning and optimization for wildlife tracking applications.

### [Development of an Automated Jig-Assisted Calibration Framework for UAV IMU Alignment in 3D SLAM]()

Accurate coordinate alignment of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is essential for ensuring robust and reliable 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) performance in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack repeatability. This study presents a jig-assisted calibration strategy that enables precise and reproducible alignment of IMU coordinate systems to enhance 3D SLAM accuracy in UAVs. The proposed method involves the design and implementation of a mechanical jig that constrains the UAV and reference sensor into a known geometric relationship. By leveraging rigid-body transformations and optimization techniques, the system effectively estimates and compensates for misalignments between the IMU and the UAV’s navigation frame. Experimental validation was conducted using simulated environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in SLAM trajectory consistency, localization precision, and map reconstruction fidelity. This jig-based calibration strategy offers a practical, scalable, and low-cost solution for UAV systems requiring high-accuracy sensor integration in GPS-denied environments.

### [A High-Payload Robotic Hopper Powered by Bidirectional Thrusters]()

Mobile robots have revolutionized various fields, offering solutions for manipulation, environmental monitoring, and exploration. However, payload capacity remains a limitation. This paper presents a novel thrust-based robotic hopper capable of carrying payloads up to 9 times its own weight while maintaining agile mobility over less structured terrain. The 220-gram robot carries up to 2 kg while hopping—--a capability that bridges the gap between high-payload ground robots and agile aerial platforms. Key advancements that enable this high-payload capacity include the integration of bidirectional thrusters, allowing for both upward and downward thrust generation to enhance energy management while hopping. Additionally, we present a refined model of dynamics that accounts for heavy payload conditions, particularly for large jumps. To address the increased computational demands, we employ a neural network compression technique, ensuring real-time onboard control. The robot's capabilities are demonstrated through a series of experiments, including autonomous navigation while carrying a 730-g LiDAR payload. This showcases the robot's potential for applications such as mobile sensing and mapping in challenging environments.

### [SADRNN: Spatial Attention Distribution with Recurrent Neural Network for Imitation Learning]()

This paper proposes Spatial Attention Distribution with Recurrent Neural Network (SADRNN), a novel attention mechanism for neural networks in imitation learning, which models spatial attention using a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Unlike conventional methods that rely on discrete spatial attention points, SADRNN generates richer spatial attention distributions by extending the attention mechanism to continuous 2D Gaussian distributions.Simulation results using a Franka Panda robotic arm demonstrate that SADRNN achieves a success rate of 88.2% in a lifting task with fewer attention distributions than existing methods. Furthermore, SADRNN reduces the number of MAC (Multiply–Accumulate) operations during inference by 28.9% compared to baseline approaches.Owing to its use of flexible 2D Gaussian distributions, SADRNN is also capable of producing spatial attention with varying widths and orientations, including diagonal patterns, at inference time.

### [Collaborative Large Language Models for Task Allocation in Construction Robots]()

The construction industry, with its dynamic environments and resource constraints, poses unique challenges for task allocation and management, particularly in integrating robotic automation. This paper introduces a multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges. The proposed approach utilizes two collaborative LLM agents, a Planner agent responsible for producing task instructions and a Supervisor agent that validates these instructions for feasibility, aiming to reduce hallucinations and planning mistakes. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in coordinating multiple robots for a high-level construction task, with essential considerations for robot battery management and logical task sequencing. Our results indicate that the multi-agent LLM system improves task reliability and accuracy compared to a single-agent configuration. This study advances the application of LLMs in construction robotics and underscores the potential for multi-agent LLM architectures to enhance task allocation in complex, automated workflows.

### [Gait Optimization for Legged Systems through Mixed Distribution Cross-Entropy Optimization]()

Legged robots are well-suited for real-world tasks, offering strong load-bearing capabilities, autonomy, and mobility over rough terrain. They strike an effective balance between agility and payload capacity, performing well in diverse environments. However, planning and optimizing gaits and contact sequences is highly challenging due to the complexity of their dynamics and the many optimization variables involved. Traditional trajectory optimization methods address this by minimizing cost functions and discovering contact sequences automatically. Yet, they often struggle with the resulting nonlinear and hard-to-solve problems. To overcome these issues, we propose CrEGOpt, a bi-level optimization method that merges trajectory optimization with black-box optimization. At the higher level, CrEGOpt uses the Mixed Distribution Cross-Entropy Method to optimize gait sequences and phase durations, easing the lower-level trajectory optimization. This approach enables fast solutions for complex gait problems. Experiments in simulation show that CrEGOpt can optimize gaits for bipedal, quadrupedal, and hexapod robots in under 10 seconds. This novel bi-level framework opens new possibilities for efficient, automatic contact scheduling in legged robotics.

### [Model-Structured Neural Networks to Model and Control Robots]()

This poster presents model-structured neural networks (MS-NNs), an emerging approach to model and control robotic systems by embedding physical laws directly into neural architectures. MS-NNs extend traditional physics-based models through targeted neuralization, preserving fundamental principles such as the superposition of forces while enhancing the learning potential. We introduce nnodely, an open-source PyTorch library designed to streamline the development of MS-NNs, while supporting other emerging paradigms like physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural ordinary differential equations, making these tools accessible even to non-experts. The library consolidates our work in MS-NNs for autonomous driving, and allows for rapid prototyping of interpretable, domain-informed models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-NNs through two applications: learning the longitudinal dynamics of a RoboRacer car and controlling the steering of a full-scale autonomous race car. In both cases, MS-NNs outperform conventional neural networks in generalization to unseen scenarios with limited training data, showcasing their potential for real-world applications in robotics.

### [LEGS-POMDP: A Language and Gesture Conditioned Framework for Robot Object Search]()

Natural human-robot interaction depends on accurately interpreting multimodal instructions, particularly those combining language and gesture. However, existing approaches often assume constrained settings and struggle with ambiguity in human intent. We present LEGS-POMDP, a probabilistic framework for robot object search that integrates multimodal instructions into a joint observation model within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. The robot maintains a belief over both object pose and identity, updating it through visual grounding, language input, and a robust gesture cone representation that fuses multiple pose vectors to infer pointing direction. In simulation across environments of varying ambiguity, fusing gesture and language achieved a 76.6% task success rate, significantly outperforming language-only (53.3%), gesture-only (46.7%), and no-instruction (20.0%) baselines. These results demonstrate that interpreting joint observations enables more accurate belief updates, reduces ambiguity, and improves decision-making for goal-directed search. We also deploy the system on the Spot robot in a 20×20 ft real-world indoor environment, where the robot successfully interprets human instructions to navigate, identify, and localize target objects among distractors—confirming the system’s robustness and generalizability beyond tabletop settings.

### [Learning by Teaching: Enhancing Mathematical Skills by Teaching a Robot]()

In this study, we explore the use of human-robot interaction to strengthen students' mathematical skills. We develop an active pedagogical approach based on the principle of learning by teaching, where the student teaches a robot to solve mathematical exercises. By guiding the robot through the solutions, the student consolidates their own knowledge and reinforces their learning. The experiment was conducted with around ten participants and evaluated using pre- and post-tests as well as a questionnaire measuring the quality of the interaction. Preliminary results indicate an improvement in students' performance on the concepts covered, as well as an overall positive feedback regarding the robot-assisted learning experience.

### [Unreal Engine Based SONAR Simulator for Marine Robot Research]()

There is a consensus that using simulations can reduce the costs associated with developing sensing technology in marine robotics. Recently developed marine simulators have focused on enhancing sensor simulation quality by increasing the rendering quality of environmental details. In this context, we developed a SONAR simulator based on Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), which supports high-fidelity environments and sensor data. UE5 offers high-quality rendered images and facilitates the implementation of large virtual environments. The robust built-in functions in UE5 also facilitated the development of a custom sensor module. We developed a Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS) sensor module using a render-based approach, which exploits high-level rendering quality. For the FLS, we capture the depth image and normal map simultaneously and convert them into range, azimuth, and intensity values to generate a sonar image. To improve the quality of the simulated sensor data, appropriate noise models were applied to the sensor module. To validate the sensor modules, we compared the simulated sensor data with real-world data. We also conducted an experiment and presented an application using ROS. For future work, we are developing additional sensor modules and robot models, aiming to utilize them for various field robot research purposes.

### [Unsupervised Identification of Motion Primitives Based on physical Constraints in Contact-Rich Tasks]()

This work proposes an automatic method for identifying motion primitives from human motion data by focusing on physical constraints. Motion primitives—fundamental units of movement in robotics—are particularly useful for dividing contact-rich tasks according to physical constraints. The challenge lies in detecting these constraints as they change direction and presence over time. The solution identifies coordinate systems that represent these continuously changing constraints, extracts features along these axes, and clusters them using BOCPD with PCA and GMM. Applied to human insertion tasks, this approach achieved over 90% identification accuracy across different insertion directions, advancing imitation learning for complex robotic tasks.

### [Design and Control of a Bench-Top Left Ventricular Simulator Reproducing Physiological Pressure-Volume Dynamics]()

Cardiovascular disease accounts for nearly 25% of all U.S. deaths and was responsible for 18.6 million global fatalities in 2019. In response, many cardiac assistive devices have been developed, yet their reliance on animal testing raises ethical concerns, and is costly, time-consuming, and frequently faces translational failures. Consequently, ventricular simulators have emerged as promising alternatives. However, due to their method of direct fluid injection into the heart phantom, simultaneously increasing volume and pressure, traditional simulators fail to replicate physiological pressure–volume (PV) dynamics of a functioning heart. We introduce a novel ventricular simulator designed with precise actuation control mechanisms to accurately mimic in vivo PV loops by controlling both pressure and fluid flow externally to the heart phantom. This integrated system features a silicone heart phantom, a syringe motor pump for controlled fluid actuation, a compliance chamber to modulate pressure dynamics, and solenoid valves for directional flow control. The optimized system design facilitates precise parameter adjustments, replicating PV loops of both normal and pathological heart conditions. Our simulator offers a promising alternative for cardiac function evaluation and medical device testing, potentially reducing animal testing reliance and enhancing clinical outcomes.

### [GLASS: A Global and Local Adaptive Segmentation System for Robust Transparent Object Segmentation]()

Transparent object segmentation is a critical yet challenging task in computer vision and autonomous perception systems, primarily due to the absence of distinct textures and ambiguous boundaries. To address these difficulties, we present GLASS, a Global and Local Adaptive Segmentation System that effectively integrates convolutional and Transformer-based representations through a hierarchical dual-path architecture. This design enables the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained local cues and long-range contextual dependencies. To further enhance the model’s discriminative capability around complex contours and transparent edges, we introduce two key components: the Multi-Scale Detail Enhancement Module (MS-DEM), which enriches local structural features at multiple resolutions, and the Bi-directional Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (Bi-AFFM), which dynamically balances global and local representations through a content-aware fusion mechanism. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, Trans10K-V2 and GSD, demonstrate that GLASS not only achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance but also exhibits strong robustness to various real-world scenes and efficiency in inference, making it a practical solution for downstream tasks involving transparent object understanding in robotics and augmented reality.

### [Long-Horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Multiple LLM Agents]()

We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help.

### [Optimal Sonar Image Selection through Information Analysis for AUV Applications]()

This paper proposes an optimal image selection method for forward-looking sonar (FLS) images aimed at improving odometry estimation for AUV applications. Selecting optimal sonar images is crucial for odometry estimation and seafloor mapping in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using image registration. However, the inherent characteristics of sonar imagery—such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), shadow effects, and perceptual ambiguity—limit the effectiveness of conventional, feature-based keyframe extraction techniques commonly used in optical imagery. To address these challenges, we propose representing sonar images as information matrices by dividing each image into grids, calculating the entropy of each grid region, arranging the entropy values row-wise, and constructing the information matrices using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The change between frames is quantified using cosine similarity between the information matrices, and frames are selected as optimal images when the similarity falls below a predefined threshold. The proposed method was validated through indoor water tank experiments using three objects with different shapes and materials, which demonstrated a clear decreasing trend in similarity. Additionally, both simulation-based evaluations and real-world seafloor data were used to estimate odometry, confirming the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Approximating Human Joint Motion Using a Simple Four-Bar Linkage Mechanism]()

Recent studies have explored human-like walking to achieve natural, efficient, and adaptive motion in robots. Among various mechanical approaches, linkage-based mechanisms have been utilized to approximate human joint trajectories due to their advantages in efficient force transmission, reduced control complexity, and high repeatability under external disturbances. Notable examples include Hoeken’s linkage, the Stephenson III six-bar linkage, and the Theo Jansen mechanism. Although multi-bar linkage systems with more than four bars generate human-like joint trajectories, their integration of multiple joints—such as the hip and knee or the knee and ankle—into a single structure complicates independent control and optimization of each joint. Therefore, this study proposes the four-bar linkage, the simplest form of a linkage mechanism, to approximate each human joint motion individually. Four-bar link lengths were optimized to align the joint trajectory with the target angular range. To improve alignment with the desired trajectory, the slope of the joint angle profile was adjusted during simulation. The effectiveness of this adjustment was then verified through experimental comparison with the simulated motion. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed four-bar linkage system as a structurally efficient solution for approximating human gait, with applicability to robotic lower-limb systems including assistive devices and bipedal robots.

### [Adaptive Gaits of TARS: A Sci-Fi Inspired Multimodal Robot]()

Science fiction has long inspired robotic design, often depicting unconventional locomotion strategies challenge real-world feasibility. One such example is TARS, the quadrilateral robot from Interstellar, which demonstrates three distinct gaits: (1) a bipedal gait where the inner and outer legs move together, (2) an upright quadrupedal gait, and (3) a high-speed rolling gait. This study explores how these three gaits could enhance mobility in space exploration and whether a robotic system can be designed to transition between them seamlessly. Two robotic designs have been developed to investigate the feasibility of these gaits: TARS v1.0, a 1:20 scale prototype that successfully implements a passive dynamic-inspired bipedal gait, and TARS v2.0, a four-legged version capable of transitioning between all three gaits. Although conventional legged systems such as quadrupeds and bipeds have often been touted as the primary solution for unmanned space exploration that overcomes the limitations of wheeled systems, this narrow perspective might overlook alternative robotic forms and locomotion strategies. This study explores the feasibility of unconventional gaits through rapid prototyping (e.g. 3D printing). Preliminary results confirm the viability of bipedal gait, with ongoing work refining the quadrupedal and rolling modes. Research advances multimodal locomotion and expands robotic design beyond conventional paradigms.

### [Shape Memory Alloy Based Implantable Device for Heart Failure]()

Heart failure (HF), particularly acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), remains a major clinical burden with limited long-term therapeutic strategies. Pharmacological treatments primarily aim to reduce congestion, yet many patients are discharged with residual symptoms, resulting in poor prognosis. Existing device-based therapies, such as balloon catheters, offer temporary relief but require hospitalization, involve direct blood contact, and are unsuitable for long-term use. This study introduces a Shape-Memory-Alloy (SMA) based implantable device designed to externally compress the superior vena cava (SVC) to modulate venous return and alleviate ADHF symptoms. The biocompatible SMA actuators dynamically adjust the cross-sectional area of the SVC without direct blood contact, thereby minimizing thrombosis and endothelial injury. Benchtop testing demonstrated effective blood flow regulation with a 68% reduction in flow rate while maintaining a safe surface temperature (<40 °C). In-vivo validation using a porcine HF model showed a significant reduction in left ventricular preload (18.6% decrease in end-diastolic volume), confirmed by a leftward shift in the pressure-volume loop. These results highlight the potential of this SMA-based device as a minimally invasive, long-term solution for treating ADHF.

### [Pose-Free Dynamic Reconstruction from Sparse Multi-Camera Sequences]()

Accurate 3D reconstruction and camera pose tracking are critical for robotic applications such as navigation and manipulation. However, existing methods often degrade in dynamic environments where moving objects introduce pose estimation errors or rely on restrictive assumptions such as fixed extrinsic calibration. While some recent approaches address dynamic scenes, most rely on monocular inputs, which can lead to geometric ambiguity. To address these challenges, we purpose a pose-free, vision-based pipeline for reconstructing dynamic scenes from sparse multi-camera sequences. Our approach leverages the foundation model MASt3R to align RGB images across time and viewpoints without requiring ground-truth camera parameters or depth measurements. To address dynamic environments, we utilize the discrepancy between ego-motion flow and optical flow to segment moving regions and decouple the point cloud into static and dynamic components. We then refine camera poses for static regions using ICP, improving the overall alignment. We validate our pipeline on a custom indoor dataset, where time-synchronized frames from dual cameras are selectively sampled to form sparse sequences reflecting real-world motion. The results demonstrate accurate camera pose estimation and clean scene reconstruction, even in the presence of motion blur and occlusions. This pipeline offers practical feasibility for multi-agent systems in real-world settings where calibration and synchronization are limited.

### [Embodied Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Perception, Planning and Control of Soft Grippers]()

Integrating AI with soft robotics offers a novel approach to enhancing robotic planning and execution. This work explores embodied AI for generalized planning in manipulation tasks using soft grippers. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detection, robots can autonomously generate high-level plans from natural language input. The system features two robotic arms, each with a soft gripper and RGBD camera. Built upon ROS 1 Framework, it includes modules for perception, planning, and control. The perception model performs 2D object detection and 3D localization using image grounding. Multistep perception expands the workspace and improves accuracy, while depth post-processing like Navier-Stokes inpainting preserves edge continuity. User input is processed via NLP to generate a concise prompt. This, along with an annotated image, is sent to a remote vision-enabled LLM, which returns high-level parameterized plans. These are translated into 6-axis joint trajectories using inverse kinematics and Cartesian path planning with MoveIt. Each joint position trajectory is sent to the corresponding joint controller through the robotic arm’s ROS driver. By linking high-level AI planning with real-world execution via soft robotics, this approach minimizes the need for extensive low-level motion planning, boosts automation in dynamic environments, and offers a more user-friendly experience.

### [Perching and Grasping by a Dual-Purpose Hybrid Gripper for Aerial Robots]()

This poster presents a dual-function hybrid gripper that enables aerial robots to have both perching and grasping functionalities, addressing the major limitations of previous solutions that focused on either functionality exclusively. Traditional perching end-effectors lack manipulation capabilities, while aerial grasping platforms often struggle with stable perching. Our approach integrates both functionalities, allowing the drone to land on various shapes of poles and irregular landing spots using a grasped connector. The hybrid gripper preserves the compliance of soft material for adaptive contact while incorporating a rigid shell to ensure sufficient load-bearing capacity. Experimental validation demonstrates successful perching on complex geometries and securely grasping diverse objects, highlighting the advantages of a unified perching-grasping mechanism.

### [Development of SAM^3: A Cable-Suspended Aerial Manipulator with a Moving Mass]()

Cable-suspended aerial manipulators (SAMs), whose bases are supported by tensioned cables and whose manipulators operate designated tasks, overcome the limitations of many aerial manipulators, such as restricted operation time and limited payload capacity, and enable aerial manipulation tasks. However, most SAM designs are confined to rotor-based actuation for oscillation damping and attitude control, which generates loud noise and strong airflow during operation, hindering integration into daily environments. Moreover, rotor-based systems require continuous base moments depending on attitude, posing challenges in terms of energy efficiency. This study proposes a SAM system that incorporates internal actuation mechanisms, namely moving masses and reaction wheels, to mitigate the drawbacks of rotor-based designs and reduce the energy required for attitude control.

### [Enhanced TEB Planner for Narrow Passages]()

Traditional path-planning methods often struggle to find optimal trajectories in narrow passages, leading to inefficient or failed maneuvers. In this study, we propose an enhanced Timed-Elastic-Band (TEB) algorithm that significantly improves obstacle avoidance in constrained environments. Our pipeline begins by randomly sampling robot configurations, which are filtered based on their proximity to the global path, generated using the A* algorithm. Next, we evaluate the clearance of each sampled configuration from nearby obstacles. If the configuration has low clearance from obstacles, it proceeds to the Medial Axis Searcher; otherwise, it is directly optimized through hyper-graph Optimization. For configurations located near obstacles, a grid search is conducted to identify the local maximum in the distance map, effectively locating a sample on the medial axis of the free space. The medial-axis configurations are then used as positional constraints in a hyper-graph optimization framework for the final local path. We evaluate our pipeline in a simulated environment across multiple narrow passage scenarios. Results show that the proposed algorithm improves success rate by 27.5% with only an 8.1% increase in average planning time compared to TEB, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### [Assistive Grasp: Smart Object Tracking for Robotic Manipulator]()

In the U.S., over 6.8 million people live with mobility-related disabilities, and nearly one-third of wheelchair users rely on daily assistance for essential tasks. With caregivers typically needed for 4–6 hours a day, families face growing physical and financial strain — all while the caregiver workforce continues to shrink. As a result, assistive technologies have emerged as alternatives, aiming to restore independence for individuals with disabilities. However, many solutions remain underutilized due to their operational complexity. For instance, wheelchair-mounted assistive robotic manipulators offer promising potential for tasks like object grasping. Yet, they demand significant cognitive and physical effort from users, which can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. To address this gap, we introduce a vision-guided system to make this easier. The robot detects and tracks the target object, aligns itself, and leaves the user with a simple task: command the gripper to grasp. Users can still fine-tune the position. The system also adapts to target motion mid-task. The system combines YOLOv8m for detection, DeepSORT for tracking, RealSense depth data for 3D localization, and PID-based planning for smooth control. It achieved an 85% success rate in trials, with a 40% reduction in user control time compared to manual operation. This work contributes toward making assistive manipulation more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly for wheelchair-bound individuals.

### [Individual and Collective Behaviors in Soft Robot Worms Inspired by Living Worm Blobs]()

California blackworms constitute a recently identified animal system exhibiting unusual collective behaviors, in which dozens to thousands of worms entangle to form a "blob" capable of actions like locomotion as an aggregate. In this paper we describe a system of pneumatic soft robots inspired by the blackworms, intended for the study of collective behaviors enabled and mediated by such physical entanglement. Both the robots and worms have high aspect ratio (≳1:50), intertwine in complex 3D configurations, operate both in air and underwater, and can locomote both individually and as a collective. We demonstrate and characterize locomotion for both individual robots and entangled blobs, explore the tunability of entanglement strength, and compare these to the analogous versions in living worms. The robots provide a testbed for studying mechanisms underlying behaviors observed in worm blobs, as well as serving as a platform for studies of novel collective behaviors based on physical entanglement.

### [Informed Repurposing of Quadruped Legs for New Tasks]()

Redesigning and remanufacturing robots are infeasible for resource-constrained environments like space or undersea. This work thus studies how to evaluate and repurpose existing, complementary, quadruped legs for new tasks. We implement this approach on 15 robot designs generated from combining six pre-selected leg designs. The performance maps for force-based locomotion tasks like pulling, pushing, and carrying objects are constructed via a learned policy that works across all designs and adapts to the limits of each. Performance predictions agree well with real-world validation results. The robot can locomote at 0.5 body lengths per second while exerting a force that is almost 60% of its weight.

### [Intelligent Self-Healing Artificial Muscle: Mechanisms for Damage Detection and Autonomous Repair of Puncture Damage in Soft Robotics]()

Soft robotics are characterized by their high deformability, mechanical robustness, and inherent resistance to damage. These unique properties present exciting new opportunities to enhance both emerging and existing fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and exploration. However, to function effectively in unstructured environments, these technologies must be able to withstand the same real-world conditions that human skin and other soft biological materials are typically subjected to. Here, we present a novel soft material architecture designed for active detection of material damage and autonomous repair in soft robotic actuators. By integrating liquid metal (LM) microdroplets within a silicone elastomer, the system can detect and localize damage through the formation of conductive pathways that arise from extreme pressure or puncture events. These newly formed conductive networks function as in situ Joule heating elements, facilitating the reprocessing and healing of the material. The architecture allows for the reconfiguration of the newly formed electrical network using high current densities, employing electromigration and thermal mechanisms to restore functionality without manual intervention. This innovative approach not only enhances the resilience and performance of soft materials but also supports a wide range of applications in soft robotics and wearable technologies, where adaptive and autonomous systems are crucial for operation in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

### [SELP: Generating Safe and Efficient Task Plans for Robot Agents with Large Language Models]()

Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enhance robot agents’ understanding and execution of natural language (NL) commands, ensuring the agents adhere to user-specified constraints remains challenging, particularly for complex commands and long-horizon tasks. To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM planners’ capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efﬁcient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high conﬁdence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms state-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks conforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency. For robot manipulation tasks, SELP achieves 20.4% improvement in safety rate. Our datasets for evaluating NL-to-LTL and robot task planning will be released in github.com/lt-asset/selp.

### [Marginalizing and Conditioning Gaussians Onto Linear Approximations of Smooth Manifolds with Applications in Robotics]()

We present closed-form expressions for marginalizing and conditioning Gaussians onto linear manifolds, and demonstrate how to apply these expressions to smooth nonlinear manifolds through linearization. Although marginalization and conditioning onto axis-aligned manifolds are well-established procedures, doing so onto non-axis-aligned manifolds is not as well understood. We demonstrate the utility of our expressions through three applications: 1) approximation of the projected normal distribution, where the quality of our linearized approximation increases as problem nonlinearity decreases; 2) covariance extraction in Koopman SLAM, where our covariances are shown to be consistent on a real-world dataset; and 3) covariance extraction in constrained GTSAM, where our covariances are shown to be consistent in simulation.

### [Dynamic Tube MPC: Learning Error Dynamics with Massively Parallel Simulation for Robust Safety in Practice]()

Safe navigation of cluttered environments is a critical challenge in robotics. It is typically approached by separating the planning and tracking problems, with planning executed on a reduced order model to generate reference trajectories, and control techniques used to track these trajectories on the full order dynamics. Inevitable tracking error necessitates robustification of the nominal plan to ensure safety; in many cases, this is accomplished via worst-case bounding, which ignores the fact that some trajectories of the planning model may be easier to track than others. In this work, we present a novel method leveraging massively parallel simulation to learn a dynamic tube representation, which characterizes tracking performance as a function of actions taken by the planning model. Planning model trajectories are then optimized such that the dynamic tube lies in the free space, allowing a balance between performance and safety to be traded off in real time. The resulting Dynamic Tube MPC is applied to the 3D hopping robot ARCHER, enabling agile and performant navigation of cluttered environments, and safe collision-free traversal of narrow corridors.

### [ISLAM: Imperative SLAM]()

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) stands as one of the critical challenges in robot navigation. A SLAM system often consists of a front-end component for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating estimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are highly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to be essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm between the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to sub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and generalization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel self-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM), which fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus enhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision. Specifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that the front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the front-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose graph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end component. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an application of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM training strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system showing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each other in a self-supervised manner.

### [DGS-SLAM: A Visual Dense SLAM Based on Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Environments]()

Visual dense SLAM can facilitate pose estimation and map reconstruction for sensor carriers in unknown environments. However, in uncontrolled environments such as offices, shopping malls, and train stations, frequent occurrences of people walking back and forth or temporary movement of objects within the scene are common. Most existing visual dense SLAM systems do not account for these dynamic factors, leading to localization drift and map distortion. In this paper, we propose DGS-SLAM, a system capable of achieving robust localization and high-fidelity static map reconstruction in dynamic environments. We utilize semantic 3D Gaussians for scene representation, effectively eliminating interference from dynamic objects and refining the reconstruction of static background. We enhance the tracking accuracy and mapping quality of dense SLAM by using a distance distribution-based Gaussian pruning algorithm and implementing a coarse-to-fine tracking strategy with bundle adjustment and differentiable rendering. We perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations on two publicly available dynamic environment datasets. The results indicate that our method effectively reduces the interference caused by dynamic objects, enabling visual dense SLAM to maintain competitive tracking accuracy and mapping performance in dynamic environments.

### [ARS-SLAM: Accurate Robust Spinning LiDAR SLAM for a Quadruped Robot in Large-Scale Scenario]()

It is challenging to employ a quadruped robot for real-time mapping and positioning in a large range of scenes. Due to the large vibration and instability of the quadruped robot in the process of motion and a large amount of calculation when expressing a large range of dense scenes, the accuracy of the drawing construction is poor and the real-time performance is poor. Therefore, we propose an accurate robust spinning LiDAR SLAM (ARS-SLAM) algorithm for a quadruped robot under the large-scale scene. The tightly coupled iterative Kalman filter in FAST-LIO2 is introduced into the front end of the cartographer framework to improve the accuracy and robustness of robot pose estimation. To reduce the computational complexity of the original cartographer framework, a pose threshold optimization algorithm was introduced to effectively remove redundant information from loop detection and improve computational efficiency and real-time performance. We tested the system's performance against the most advanced point-cloud-based methods, LIO-SAM and FAST-LIO2, on a large dataset of large science parks and underground parking lots, and the results show that the proposed system achieves the same or better accuracy and real-time performance.

### [Tightly Coupled Range Inertial Odometry and Mapping with Exact Point Cloud Downsampling]()

In this work, to facilitate the real-time processing of multi-scan registration error minimization on factor graphs, we devise a point cloud downsampling algorithm based on coreset extraction. This algorithm extracts a subset of the residuals of input points such that the subset yields exactly the same quadratic error function as that of the original set for a given pose. This enables a significant reduction in the number of residuals to be evaluated without approximation errors at the sampling point. Using this algorithm, we devise a complete SLAM framework that consists of odometry estimation based on sliding window optimization and global trajectory optimization based on registration error minimization over the entire map, both of which can run in real time on a standard CPU. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based SLAM frameworks without the use of GPU acceleration.

### [Scalable Multi-Session Visual SLAM in Large-Scale Scenes with Subgraph Optimization]()

Multi-session visual SLAM systems enable 6-DoF camera localization along with long-term maintenance and expansion of the global map, by utilizing image data from different sessions. However, in large-scale environments, these systems often suffer from severe scale drift. While modern SLAM systems attempt to maintain global map consistency through loop detection and correction, they still face challenges in terms of convergence and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a robust large-scale multi-session SLAM system for long-term localization and mapping that achieves global consistency. Furthermore, to address the backend optimization problem in large-scale environments, we introduce a hierarchical optimization strategy based on the graph structure. More specifically, a subgraph structure is introduced to reduce the size of problem while effectively propagating scale correction information. In addition, a hierarchical strategy enables coarse-to-fine updates of the graph states. Experimental results not only demonstrate that our method efficiently optimizes the pose graph and maintains map consistency in large-scale environments, but also highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.

### [Accurate and Rapidly-Convergent GNSS/INS/LiDAR Tightly-Coupled Integration Via Invariant EKF Based on Two-Frame Group (I)]()

Nowadays, increasing attention has been directed toward the integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation satellite system (INS), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for intelligent system navigation. However, the existing systems, which generally adopt estimators of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or factor graph optimization (FGO), still face challenges regarding consistency and convergence. Such methods could provide optimal navigation solutions only if the initial guess of the state is sufficiently close to the true trajectory; otherwise, the systems might undergo accuracy loss or even worse, divergence. To address this issue, we derive an invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) based on the two-frame group (TFG) in the left-invariant form, and integrate raw GNSS double-differenced observations, inertial measurements, and LiDAR plane features within this framework. By designing a unified group structure that simultaneously maintains both the navigation states and inertial measurement unit (IMU) biases, TFG contributes to the approximate log-linearity and invariance of the system dynamics model, expected to effectively resolve the convergence issue. A set of real-world experiments was conducted to evaluate the system, with results indicating its potential to achieve submeter to centimeter-level positioning accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, availability, and convergence.

### [Winding Number-Guided Edge-Preserving Implicit Neural Representation of CAD Surfaces]()

Implicit Neural representations have emerged as a powerful tool for the task of 3D reconstruction due to their excellent performance. However, the existing methods cannot achieve ideal results on CAD models, mainly because they are usually constructed from piecewise smooth surfaces and have sharp edge structure. To this end, we propose a winding number-guided implicit surface reconstruction method, which mainly consists of a winding number-guided regularizer and a dynamic edge sampling strategy. Among them, the winding number-guided regularizer can effectively constrain the global normal consistency of the input raw data, as well as improve the unsatisfactory implicit surface reconstruction result caused by the unavailability of normal information. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the excessive smoothing at sharp edges of implicit surface, we proposed a dynamic edge sampling strategy for sampling near the sharp edge regions of 3D shape, which can effectively avoid the regularizer from smoothing all regions. Finally, we combine them with a simple data term for robust implicit surface reconstruction. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction results.

### [A Refined 3D Gaussian Representation for High-Quality Dynamic Scene Reconstruction]()

In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has revolutionized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with its implicit representation. Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally, effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing challenge. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a refined 3D Gaussian representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model. Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and motion consistency constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in rendering quality and speed, while significantly reducing the memory usage associated with 3D-GS, making it highly suitable for various tasks such as novel view synthesis, and dynamic mapping.

### [GaussianRoom: Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting with SDF Guidance and Monocular Cues for Indoor Scene Reconstruction]()

Embodied intelligence requires precise reconstruction and rendering to simulate large-scale real-world data. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated high-quality results with real-time performance, it still faces challenges in indoor scenes with large, textureless regions, resulting in incomplete and noisy reconstructions due to poor point cloud initialization and underconstrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we propose a unified optimization framework that integrates neural signed distance fields (SDFs) with 3DGS for accurate geometry reconstruction and real-time rendering. This framework incorporates a neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to model scenes accurately even with poor initialized point clouds. Simultaneously, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms based on normal and edge priors to resolve geometric ambiguities in textureless areas and enhance detail accuracy. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

### [Hide-In-Motion: Embedding Steganographic Copyright Information into 4D Gaussian Splatting Assets]()

As 4D extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) emerge as groundbreaking techniques for dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis in robotics and computer vision, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of these assets becomes crucial. While steganography has advanced significantly in 2D and 3D media, existing methods are inadequate for the complex, dynamic nature of 4D-GS representations. To address this gap, we propose name, a novel 4D steganography method for hiding information through deformation in Gaussian splatting. Our approach introduces a composite attribute and a Decouple Feature Field for coarse-to-fine deformation modeling and embedding implicit information, along with an Opacity-Guided Adaptive strategy. name~overcomes the limitations of previous techniques, enhancing both the robustness of embedded information and the quality of 4D reconstruction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully embeds and recovers implicit information across various modalities while maintaining high rendering quality in dynamic scenes. This work not only advances copyright protection and secure data transmission for 4D assets but also paves the way for enhancing the security and integrity of 4D digital assets.

### [DENSER: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Scene Reconstruction of Dynamic Urban Environments]()

This paper presents DENSER, a framework leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for the reconstruction of dynamic urban environments. While several methods for photorealistic scene representations, both implicitly using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and explicitly using 3DGS have shown promising results in scene reconstruction of relatively complex dynamic scenes, modeling the dynamic appearance of foreground objects tends to be challenging, limiting the applicability of these methods to capture subtleties and details of the scenes, especially for dynamic objects. To this end, we propose DENSER, a framework that significantly enhances the representation of dynamic objects and accurately models the appearance of dynamic objects in the driving scene. Instead of directly using Spherical Harmonics (SH) to model the appearance of dynamic objects, we introduce and integrate a new method aiming at dynamically estimating SH bases using wavelets, resulting in better representation of dynamic objects appearance in both space and time. Besides object appearance, DENSER enhances object shape representation through densification of its point cloud across multiple scene frames, resulting in faster convergence of model training. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin. Source codes and models will be uploaded to this repository https://github.com/sntubix/denser

### [Factorized Multi-Resolution HashGrid for Efficient Neural Radiance Fields: Execution on Edge-Devices]()

We introduce Fact-Hash, a novel parameter-encoding method for training on-device neural radiance fields. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have proven pivotal in 3D representations, but their applications are limited due to large computational resources. On-device training can open large application fields, providing strength in communication limitations, privacy concerns, and fast adaptation to a frequently changing scene. However, challenges such as limited resources (GPU memory, storage, and power) impede their deployment. To handle this, we introduce Fact-Hash, a novel parameter-encoding merging Tensor Factorization and Hash-encoding techniques. This integration offers two benefits: the use of rich high resolution features and the few-shot robustness. In Fact-Hash, we project 3D coordinates into multiple lower-dimensional forms (2D or 1D) before applying the hash function and then aggregate them into a single feature. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate Fact-Hash's superior memory efficiency, preserving quality and rendering speed. Fact-Hash saves memory usage by over one-third while maintaining the PSNR values compared to previous encoding methods. The on-device experiment validates the superiority of Fact-Hash compared to alternative positional encoding methods in computational efficiency and energy consumption. These findings highlight Fact-Hash as a promising solution to improve feature grid representation, address memory constraints, and improve quality in various applications.

### [3D Uncertain Implicit Surface Mapping Using GMM and GP]()

In this study, we address the challenge of constructing continuous three-dimensional (3D) models that accurately represent uncertain surfaces, derived from noisy and incomplete LiDAR scanning data. Building upon our prior work, which utilized the Gaussian Process (GP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for structured building models, we introduce a more generalized approach tailored for complex surfaces in urban scenes, where GMM Regression and GP with derivative observations are applied. A Hierarchical GMM (HGMM) is employed to optimize the number of GMM components and speed up the GMM training. With the prior map obtained from HGMM, GP inference is followed for the refinement of the final map. Our approach models the implicit surface of the geo-object and enables the inference of the regions that are not completely covered bymeasurements. The integration of GMM and GP yields well-calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside the surface model, enhancing both accuracy and reliability. The proposed method is evaluated on real datacollected by a mobile mapping system. Compared to the performance in mapping accuracy and uncertainty quantification of other methods, such as Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (GPIS) and log-Gaussian Process Implicit Surface map (Log-GPIS), the proposed method achieves lower RMSEs, higher log-likelihood values and lower computational costsfor the evaluated datasets.

### [Mono-Camera-Only Target Chasing for a Drone in a Dense Environment by Cross-Modal Learning]()

Chasing a dynamic target in a dense environment is one of the challenging applications of autonomous drones. The task requires multi-modal data, such as RGB and depth, to accomplish safe and robust maneuver. However, using different types of modalities can be difficult due to the limited capacity of drones in aspects of hardware complexity and sensor cost. Our framework resolves such restrictions in the target chasing task by using only a monocular camera instead of multiple sensor inputs. From an RGB input, the perception module can extract a cross-modal representation containing information from multiple data modalities. To learn cross-modal representations at training time, we employ variational auto-encoder (VAE) structures and the joint objective function across heterogeneous data. Subsequently, using latent vectors acquired from the pre-trained perception module, the planning module generates a proper next-time-step waypoint by imitation learning of the expert, which performs a numerical optimization using the privileged RGB-D data. Furthermore, the planning module considers temporal information of the target to improve tracking performance through consecutive cross-modal representations. Ultimately, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through the reconstruction results of the perception module, the target chasing performance of the planning module, and the zero-shot sim-to-real deployment of a drone.

### [CoopDETR: A Unified Cooperative Perception Framework for 3D Detection Via Object Query]()

Cooperative perception enhances the individual perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by providing a comprehensive view of the environment. However, balancing perception performance and transmission costs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches that transmit region-level features across agents are limited in interpretability and demand substantial bandwidth, making them unsuitable for practical applications. In this work, we propose CoopDETR, a novel cooperative perception framework that introduces object-level feature cooperation via object query. Our framework consists of two key modules: single-agent query generation, which efficiently encodes raw sensor data into object queries, reducing transmission cost while preserving essential information for detection; and cross-agent query fusion, which includes Spatial Query Matching (SQM) and Object Query Aggregation (OQA) to enable effective interaction between queries. Our experiments on the OPV2V and V2XSet datasets demonstrate that CoopDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly reduces transmission costs to 1/782 of previous methods.

### [Learning Better Representations for Crowded Pedestrians in Offboard LiDAR-Camera 3D Tracking-By-Detection]()

Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency. The code will be publicly available at this HTTP URL.

### [Bi-Stream Knowledge Transfer for Semi-Supervised 3D Point Cloud Object Detection]()

3D point cloud object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. However, labeling 3D object boxes is expensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of annotated point clouds used in fully-supervised training. This has led to a rise in semi-supervised 3D object detection research, which aims to improve model performance by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled point clouds. Existing methods typically rely on the Mean Teacher (MT) paradigm, which uses unlabeled instances discovered by the teacher with confidence scores higher than certain thresholds to train the student. However, this leads to a loss of information as it overlooks ambiguous instances from the teacher that could also contain valuable knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a Bi-Stream Knowledge Transfer (BiKT) framework that fully exploits and transfers knowledge from both confident and ambiguous instances to the student network. Specifically, all pseudo labels are allocated into two knowledge streams, the deterministic stream and the noisy stream, and then subsequently guide the student network through bi-level supervision. We also introduce a Dynamic Stream Switching (DSS) algorithm that sets the stream boundary tailored for the current learning status. To further improve the quality of pseudo labels in the knowledge streams, we propose a Diffusive Label Denoising (DLD) module, which is trained by explicitly generating noised instances and then learning to denoise them, as in diffusion models. Experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our BiKT on the ONCE validation and testing sets, as well as the robust generalization capability when confronted with diverse base detectors, increased amount of unlabeled data, and distinct datasets (e.g., Waymo), unveiling the power of semi-supervised learning in 3D object detection.

### [Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion for LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection]()

LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.

### [OoDIS: Anomaly Instance Segmentation and Detection Benchmark]()

Safe navigation of self-driving cars and robots requires a precise understanding of their environment. Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems. We provide a competition and benchmark website under https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/oodis.

### [Hybrid Attention for Robust RGB-T Pedestrian Detection in Real-World Conditions]()

Multispectral pedestrian detection has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in autonomous driving applications. To address the challenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of thermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing fusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur due to the sensor configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of information in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called the Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate performance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when at least part of the scene is acquired by a single sensor. We propose an improved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor failure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also leverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in embedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial overlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superiority in handling real-world challenges.

### [Safe Interval Motion Planning for Quadrotors in Dynamic Environments]()

Trajectory generation in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge for quadrotors, particularly due to the non-convexity in the spatial-temporal domain. Many existing methods either assume simplified static environments or struggle to produce optimal solutions in real-time. In this work, we propose an efficient safe interval motion planning framework for navigation in dynamic environments. A safe interval refers to a time window during which a specific configuration is safe. Our approach addresses trajectory generation through a two-stage process: a front-end graph search step followed by a back-end gradient-based optimization. We ensure completeness and optimality by constructing a dynamic connected visibility graph and incorporating low-order dynamic bounds within safe intervals and temporal corridors. To avoid local minima, we propose a Uniform Temporal Visibility Deformation (UTVD) for the complete evaluation of spatial-temporal topological equivalence. We represent trajectories with B-Spline curves and apply gradient-based optimization to navigate around static and moving obstacles within spatial-temporal corridors. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that our method can achieve a success rate of over 95% in environments with different density levels, exceeding the performance of other approaches, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in highly dynamic environments.

### [Towards Safe and Energy-Efficient Real-Time Motion Planning in Windy Urban Environments]()

Urban winds are a serious hazard for low-altitude autonomous aerial operations in urban airspaces. Previous methods for motion planning in urban winds require global knowledge of the obstacles and flow field and do not lend themselves to real-time application. In this paper, a planning and control framework is proposed for safe and energy-efficient navigation through urban flow fields that strictly relies on onboard sensing. The algorithm incorporates predictions of local wind flow fields into a receding horizon optimal controller, balancing energy consumption with obstacle avoidance on the fly to reach a goal destination. Simulation studies on a procedurally generated urban map with diverse wind conditions demonstrate that the energy-aware motion planner reduces energy consumption by as much as 30% and results in 32% fewer crashes on average compared to the wind-agnostic baseline. Comparisons to a global wind-aware planner indicate only minor trade-offs associated with planning on a local horizon.

### [Dynamic Perception-Enhanced Motion Planning and Control for UAVs Flights in Challenging Dynamic Environments]()

The autonomous flights of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments have garnered significant attention. However, most existing methods only achieve safe navigation in static environments or spacious scenes with few moving obstacles. Motivated by this open problem, this paper presents a complete system for safe and autonomous UAVs flights in unknown clustered environments with multiple dynamic obstacles. To properly represent complex dynamic environments, we develop a 3D dynamic Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) mapping method that initially segments and tracks dynamic obstacles using a novel feature-based association strategy, while fusing the remaining static obstacles into ESDF map. Then, we propose a joint trajectory planning and motion control framework for safely avoiding surrounding obstacles. Specifically, the gradient-based B-spline trajectory optimization algorithm is employed to generate a collision-free static trajectory with respect to static obstacles. To avoid dynamic obstacles while adaptively tracking the static trajectory, we utilize time-adaptive model predictive control combined with Dynamic Control Barrier Function (D-CBF), which maps the collision avoidance constraints of dynamic obstacles onto the control inputs. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments confirm that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches for UAVs flights in challenging dynamic environments.

### [Real-Time Sampling-Based Online Planning for Drone Interception]()

This paper studies high-speed online planning in dynamic environments. The problem requires finding time-optimal trajectories that conform to system dynamics, meeting computational constraints for real-time adaptation, and accounting for uncertainty from environmental changes. To address these challenges, we propose a sampling-based online planning algorithm that leverages neural network inference to replace time-consuming nonlinear trajectory optimization, enabling rapid exploration of multiple trajectory options under uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to the drone interception problem, where a defense drone must intercept a target while avoiding collisions and handling imperfect target predictions. The algorithm efficiently generates trajectories toward multiple potential target drone positions in parallel. It then assesses trajectory reachability by comparing traversal times with the target drone's predicted arrival time, ultimately selecting the minimum-time reachable trajectory. Through extensive validation in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate our method's capability for high-rate online planning and its adaptability to unpredictable movements in unstructured settings.

### [Optimal Trajectory Planning for Cooperative Manipulation with Multiple Quadrotors Using Control Barrier Functions]()

In this paper, we present a novel trajectory planning algorithm for cooperative manipulation with multiple quadrotors using control barrier functions (CBFs). Our ap- proach addresses the complex dynamics of a system in which a team of quadrotors transports and manipulates a cable- suspended rigid-body payload in environments cluttered with obstacles. The proposed algorithm ensures obstacle avoidance for the entire system, including the quadrotors, cables, and the payload in all six degrees of freedom (DoF). We introduce the use of CBFs to enable safe and smooth maneuvers, effectively navigating through cluttered environments while accommodating the system’s nonlinear dynamics. To simplify complex constraints, the system components are modeled as convex polytopes, and the Duality theorem is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization prob- lem. We validate the performance of our planning approach both in simulation and real-world environments using multiple quadrotors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving obstacle avoidance and safe trajectory generation for cooperative transportation tasks.

### [Servo Integrated Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Overactuated Tiltable-Quadrotors]()

Utilizing a servo to tilt each rotor transforms quadrotors from underactuated to overactuated systems, allowing for independent control of both attitude and position, which provides advantages for aerial manipulation. However, this enhancement also introduces model nonlinearity, sluggish servo response, and limited operational range into the system, posing challenges to dynamic control. In this study, we propose a control approach for tiltable-quadrotors based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). Unlike conventional cascade methods, our approach preserves the full dynamics without simplification. It directly uses rotor thrust and servo angle as control inputs, where their limited working ranges are considered input constraints. Notably, we incorporate a first-order servo model within the NMPC framework. Simulation reveals that integrating the servo dynamics is not only an enhancement to control performance but also a critical factor for optimization convergence. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we fabricate a tiltable-quadrotor and deploy the algorithm onboard at 100Hz. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate rapid, robust, and smooth pose-tracking performance.

### [Geometric Tracking Control of Omnidirectional Multirotors for Aggressive Maneuvers]()

An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors' motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.

### [Topology-Based Visual Active Room Segmentation]()

Room segmentation plays a significant role in scene understanding, semantic mapping, and scene coverage for robots navigating in real-world indoor environments. However, most previous works take a passive segmentation that requires a complete and uncluttered grid map as input, often resulting in lower segmentation accuracy and cannot be deployed in unknown environments. In this paper, we propose an active room segmentation framework that can enable a robot to incrementally and autonomously perform room segmentation in cluttered indoor environments. Our framework consists of three key components: i) a door extraction module where a visual semantic feature, specifically, door, is extracted to better identify rooms in cluttered environments, ii) a within-room exploration module that detects frontiers within the currently exploring room, and iii) a topological module that represents connectivity between rooms and determines next room for exploration. We show through experiments that the proposed method depicts two distinct advantages against existing methods in segmentation accuracy and autonomy. The code is available at https://github.com/FreeformRobotics/Active_room_segmentatio n .

### [ReMEmbR: Building and Reasoning Over Long-Horizon Spatio-Temporal Memory for Robot Navigation]()

Navigating and understanding complex environments over extended periods of time is a significant challenge for robots. People interacting with the robot may want to ask questions like where something happened, when it occurred, or how long ago it took place, which would require the robot to reason over a long history of their deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a Retrieval-augmented Memory for Embodied Robots, or ReMEmbR, a system designed for long-horizon video question answering for robot navigation. To evaluate ReMEmbR, we introduce the NaVQA dataset where we annotate spatial, temporal, and descriptive questions to long-horizon robot navigation videos. ReMEmbR employs a structured approach involving a memory building and a querying phase, leveraging temporal information, spatial information, and images to efficiently handle continuously growing robot histories. Our experiments demonstrate that ReMEmbR outperforms LLM and VLM baselines, allowing ReMEmbR to achieve effective long-horizon reasoning with low latency. Additionally, we deploy ReMEmbR on a robot and show that our approach can handle diverse queries. The dataset, code, videos, and other material can be found at the following link: https://nvidia-ai-iot.github.io/remembr.

### [Online Diffusion-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction at the Frontier with Probabilistic Map Reconciliation]()

Autonomous navigation and exploration in unmapped environments remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty robots face in making commonsense inference of unobserved geometries. Recent advancements have demonstrated that generative modeling techniques, particularly diffusion models, can enable systems to infer these geometries from partial observation. In this work, we present implementation details and results for real-time, online occupancy prediction using a modified diffusion model. By removing attention-based visual conditioning and visual feature extraction components, we achieve a 73% reduction in runtime with minimal accuracy reduction. These modifications enable occupancy prediction across the entire map, rather than limiting it to the area around the robot where sensor data can be collected. We introduce a probabilistic update method for merging predicted occupancy data into running occupancy maps, resulting in a 71% improvement in predicting occupancy at map frontiers compared to previous methods. Finally, our code and a ROS node for on-robot operation can be found on our website: https://arpg.github.io/scenesense/.

### [Point2Graph: An End-To-End Point Cloud-Based 3D Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph for Robot Navigation]()

Current open-vocabulary scene graph generation algorithms highly rely on both 3D scene point cloud data and posed RGB-D images and thus have limited applications in scenarios where RGB-D images or camera poses are not readily available. To solve this problem, we propose Point2Graph, a novel end-to-end point cloud-based 3D open-vocabulary scene graph generation framework in which the requirement of posed RGB-D image series is eliminated. This hierarchical framework contains room and object detection/segmentation and open-vocabulary classification. For the room layer, we leverage the advantage of merging the geometry-based border detection algorithm with the learning-based region detection to segment rooms and create a “Snap-Lookup” framework for open-vocabulary room classification. In addition, we create an end-to-end pipeline for the object layer to detect and classify 3D objects based solely on 3D point cloud data. Our evaluation results show that our framework can outperform the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-vocabulary object and room segmentation and classification algorithm on widely used real-scene datasets. We provide code and videos at: https://point2graph.github.io/

### [Estimating Commonsense Scene Composition on Belief Scene Graphs]()

This work establishes the concept of commonsense scene composition, with a focus on extending Belief Scene Graphs by estimating the spatial distribution of unseen objects. Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI) model for learning probability distributions: (i) a baseline approach based on a Graph Convolutional Network, and (ii) a neuro-symbolic extension that integrates a spatial ontology based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, this article provides a detailed description of the dataset generation process for such tasks. Finally, the framework has been validated through multiple runs on simulated data, as well as in a real-world indoor environment, demonstrating its ability to spatially interpret scenes across different room types. For a video of the article, showcasing the experimental demonstration, please refer to the following link: https://youtu.be/f0tqtPVFZ2A

### [VLM-Vac: Enhancing Smart Vacuums through VLM Knowledge Distillation and Language-Guided Experience Replay]()

In this paper, we propose VLM-Vac, a novel framework designed to enhance the autonomy of smart robot vacuum cleaners. Our approach integrates the zero-shot object detection capabilities of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Knowledge Distillation (KD) strategy. By leveraging the VLM, the robot can categorize objects into actionable classes---either to avoid or to suck---across diverse backgrounds. However, frequently querying the VLM is computationally expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we implement a KD process that gradually transfers the essential knowledge of the VLM to a smaller, more efficient model. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this smaller model progressively learns from the VLM and requires significantly fewer queries over time. Additionally, we tackle the challenge of continual learning in dynamic home environments by exploiting a novel experience replay method based on language-guided sampling. Our results show that this approach not only reduces energy consumption by 53% compared to cumulative learning but also surpasses conventional vision-based clustering methods, particularly in detecting small objects across diverse backgrounds.

### [Simultaneously Search and Localize Semantic Objects in Unknown Environments]()

For a robot in an unknown environment to find a target semantic object, it must perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at both geometric and semantic levels using its onboard sensors while planning and executing its motion based on the ever-updated SLAM results. In other words, the robot must simultaneously conduct localization, semantic mapping, motion planning, and execution online in the presence of sensing and motion uncertainty. This is an open problem as it intertwines semantic SLAM and adaptive online motion planning and execution under uncertainty based on perception. Moreover, the goals of the robot's motion change on the fly depending on whether and how the robot can detect the target object. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem, leveraging semantic SLAM, Bayesian Networks, and online probabilistic motion planning. The results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and efficiency.

### [Integrated Barometric Pressure Sensors on Legged Robots for Enhanced Tactile Exploration of Edges]()

This paper presents a new tactile sensor that utilizes an array of barometric pressure sensors encased in a deformable rubber sphere. Designed as an end effector foot of the legged quadruped robot Unitree Go1, the proposed sensor is able to withstand repeated impacts of at least 40N at the feet. Tactile sensing in legged robotics extends their utility specifically in the context of edge detection and exploration. The presented tactile contact framework processes the pressure data to classify the type of contact (no contact, flat or edge) and the orientation of the edges relative to robot base. To assess the performance of the sensors and their ability for tactile edge exploration we extensively test with the legged robot in varied conditions including different terrains, changing payloads, exposure to dynamic disturbances, and sloped edges. The edge detection is compared against the original scalar force sensors. Experiments demonstrate a mean absolute error of 2° for predicted edge orientation at a detection range of 14 mm and robust operation in realistic operating conditions for medium-sized quadruped robots. With this contribution, we aim to enhance the capabilities and safety of legged robots in various applications.

### [Development of a New Biped Robot with Adaptive Suction Modules for Climbing on Curved Surfaces]()

Regular cleaning and maintenance of high-altitude pipes and curved surfaces on high-rise buildings are high-risk tasks for human workers due to the difficulty of working on curved planes. To address such challenge, automated robots are widely used for cleaning buildings with flat walls, but they cannot climb on curved surfaces, limiting their practical applications. This paper proposes a novel biped curved-surface climbing robot (BCCR) with five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) motion. The BCCR features adaptive vacuum suction modules that can adhere to both curved and flat surfaces, allowing seamless movement of the BCCR across various surfaces. Each terminal suction module is composed of three small suction cups, which are capable of rotating in all directions to achieve adaptive adhesion on various surfaces. The 5-DOF structure enables the robot to cross obstacles and makes it highly versatile for various cleaning tasks on a wide range of surfaces, including large curved pipes. The mechanism design and analytical modeling of the BCCR are carried out, demonstrating its robust curved-surface climbing capabilities. Moreover, a prototype is fabricated for experimental investigation. The results indicate that the proposed 5-DOF BCCR can achieve stable climbing on curved surfaces.

### [Zippy: The Smallest Power-Autonomous Bipedal Robot]()

Miniaturizing legged robot platforms is challenging due to hardware limitations that constrain the number, power density, and precision of actuators at that size. By leveraging design principles of quasi-passive walking robots at any scale, stable locomotion and steering can be achieved with simple mechanisms and open-loop control. Here, we present the design and control of “Zippy”, the smallest self-contained bipedal walking robot at only 3.6 cm tall. Zippy has rounded feet, a single motor without feedback control, and is capable of turning, skipping, and ascending steps. At its fastest pace, the robot achieves a forward walking speed of 25 cm/s, which is 10 leg lengths per second, the fastest biped robot of any size by that metric. This work explores the design and performance of the robot and compares it to similar dynamic walking robots at larger scales.

### [Exploration and Analysis of Torso-Limb Coordination of Quadruped Walkers with Compliant Torso]()

Quadrupeds exhibit remarkable locomotion performance through the coordination between their limbs and torso. From past biological knowledge, it is understood that during walking, the forelimbs primarily contribute to braking, while the hindlimb are responsible for propulsion. However, in the field of quadruped robot dynamics, effectively leveraging this coordination remains a challenge. To investigate the torso-limb coordination, this study explores the walking performance of a quadruped walker with a compliant torso, driven by the forelimb or the hindlimb. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the walking behavior under different control drive methods. The findings provide insights into the design of compliant-bodied robots and the optimal distribution of propulsion forces between the forelimbs and hindlimbs.

### [Effective Self-Righting Strategies for Elongate Multi-Legged Robots]()

Centipede-like robots offer an effective and robust solution to navigation over complex terrain with minimal sensing. However, when climbing over obstacles, such multi-legged robots often elevate their center-of-mass into unstable configurations, where even moderate terrain uncertainty can cause tipping over. Robust mechanisms for such elongate multi-legged robots to self-right remain unstudied. Here, we developed a comparative biological and robophysical approach to investigate self-righting strategies. We first released textit{S. polymorpha} upside down from a 10 cm height and recorded their self-righting behaviors using top and side view high-speed cameras. Using kinematic analysis, we hypothesize that these behaviors can be prescribed by two traveling waves superimposed in the body’s lateral and vertical planes, respectively. We tested our hypothesis on an elongate robot with static (non-actuated) limbs, and we successfully reconstructed these self-righting behaviors. We further evaluated how wave parameters affect self-righting effectiveness. We identified two key wave parameters: the spatial frequency, which characterizes the sequence of body-rolling, and the wave amplitude, which characterizes body curvature. By empirically obtaining a behavior diagram of spatial frequency and amplitude, we identify effective and versatile self-righting strategies for general elongate multi-legged robots, which greatly enhances these robots' mobility and robustness in practical applications such as agricultural terrain inspection and search-and-rescue.

### [Addition of a Peristaltic Wave Improves Multi-Legged Locomotion Performance on Complex Terrains]()

Characterized by their elongate bodies and relatively simple legs, multi-legged robots have the potential to locomote through complex terrains for applications such as search-and-rescue and terrain inspection. Prior work has developed effective and reliable locomotion strategies for multi-legged robots by propagating the two waves of lateral body undulation and leg stepping, which we will refer to as the two-wave template. However, these robots have limited capability to climb over obstacles with sizes comparable to their heights. We hypothesize that such limitations stem from the two-wave template that we used to prescribe the multi-legged locomotion. Seeking effective alternative waves for obstacle-climbing, we designed a five-segment robot with static (non-actuated) legs, where each cable-driven joint has a rotational degree-of-freedom (DoF) in the sagittal plane (vertical wave) and a linear DoF (peristaltic wave). We tested robot locomotion performance on a flat terrain and a rugose terrain. While the benefit of peristalsis on flat-ground locomotion is marginal, the inclusion of a peristaltic wave substantially improves the locomotion performance in rugose terrains: it not only enables obstacle-climbing capabilities with obstacles having a similar height as the robot, but it also significantly improves the traversing capabilities of the robot in such terrains. Our results demonstrate an alternative actuation mechanism for multi-legged robots, paving the way towards all-terrain multi-legged robots.

### [In Vivo Feasibility Study: Evaluating Autonomous Data-Driven Robotic Needle Trajectory Correction in MRI-Guided Transperineal Procedures]()

This study addresses the targeting challenges in MRI-guided transperineal needle placement for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, a procedure where accuracy is crucial for effective outcomes. We introduce a parameter-agnostic trajectory correction approach incorporating a data-driven closed-loop strategy by radial displacement and an FBG-based shape sensing to enable autonomous needle steering. In an animal study designed to emulate clinical complexity and assess MRI compatibility through a mock biopsy procedure, our approach demonstrated a significant improvement in targeting accuracy (p < 0.05), with mean target error of only 2.2 ± 1.9 mm on first insertion attempts, without needle reinsertions. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first in vivo evaluation of robotic needle steering with FBG-sensor feedback, marking a significant step towards its clinical translation.

### [Pre-Surgical Planner for Robot-Assisted Vitreoretinal Surgery: Integrating Eye Posture, Robot Position and Insertion Point]()

Several robotic frameworks have been recently developed to assist ophthalmic surgeons in performing complex vitreoretinal procedures such as subretinal injection of advanced therapeutics. These surgical robots show promising capabilities; however, most of them have to limit their working volume to achieve maximum accuracy. Moreover, the visible area seen through the surgical microscope is limited and solely depends on the eye posture. If the eye posture, trocar position, and robot configuration are not correctly arranged, the instrument may not reach the target position, and the preparation will have to be redone. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimization framework of the eye tilting and the robot positioning to reach various target areas for different patients. Our method was validated with an adjustable phantom eye model, and the error of this workflow was 0.13 ± 1.65 deg (rotational joint around Y axis), -1.40 ± 1.13 deg (around X axis), and 1.80 ± 1.51 mm (depth, Z). The potential error sources are also analyzed in the discussion section.

### [Suture Thread Modeling Using Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Surgery]()

Automating surgical systems enhances precision and safety while reducing human involvement in high-risk environments. A major challenge in automating surgical procedures like suturing is accurately modeling the suture thread, a highly flexible and compliant component. Existing models either lack the accuracy needed for safety-critical procedures or are too computationally intensive for real-time execution. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for modeling suture thread dynamics using control barrier functions (CBFs), achieving both realism and computational efficiency. Thread-like behavior, collision avoidance, stiffness, and damping are all modeled within a unified CBF and control Lyapunov function (CLFs) framework. Our approach eliminates the need to calculate complex forces or solve differential equations, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining a realistic model suitable for both automation and virtual-reality surgical training systems. The framework also allows visual cues to be provided based on the thread’s interaction with the environment, enhancing user experience when performing suture or ligation tasks. The proposed model is tested on the MagnetoSuture system, a minimally invasive robotic surgical platform that uses magnetic fields to manipulate suture needles, offering a less invasive solution for surgical procedures.

### [Robotic Colonoscopy: Can High Fidelity Simulation Optimize Robot Design and Validation?]()

This paper presents the use of a simulation environment as an accurate, ethical and sustainable alternative to testing robotic prototypes in animal models and simplified phantom models. The simulation is specifically developed for robotic colonoscopy devices inside the human colon. A virtual simulation of the locomotion mechanism of a prototype robotic colonoscope and the colon was created in Ansys, and robot/colon experiments were conducted on different colon surfaces to validate simulation results. The successfully simulated propulsion force generated by the prototype produced an RMSE of 7% when compared at the optimal operating condition of the device, and 25-30% when compared to a full range of device velocities. The larger RMSE is due to physical phenomena that were not present in the simulation due to the constraints applied. The simulation, however, allowed evaluation of difficult quantities to measure in the real settings such as the normal interaction force between the device and tissue wall, and stress distribution across the locomotion mechanism, as well as a phenomenon of oscillating propulsion force resulting from the device design. This work demonstrates feasibility of using finite element simulation to shape the design and optimization of a robotic colonoscope, and understands its interaction with highly complex human anatomy.

### [Robotic Tissue Manipulation in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Via Visual Feedback]()

Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite advancements in screening and treatment, there remains a critical need for more effective and minimally invasive methods to manage complex polyps and early-stage colorectal cancers. This study introduces a novel approach to magnetic tissue manipulation for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD), leveraging visual feedback to enhance precision and control. We develop and evaluate the proposed system within a ROS Gazebo simulation environment, integrating a small magnetic endoscopic clip affixed to tissue, which is manipulated by an external large magnet mounted on a robotic arm. A key challenge in ESD is achieving adequate tissue exposure for precise cutting, particularly in the confined space of the colon where the endoscope is manually controlled. To address this, our system enables controlled manipulation of the magnetic clip to optimize tissue retraction. The robotic arm, guided by real-time visual feedback, dynamically adjusts the internal clip’s orientation. Multiple virtual cameras were used to validate the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrated that the robot arm successfully manipulated the internal magnetic clip to the desired tilt angle within an average of 8.4 seconds (range 5.3 to 15.2 s). Our findings suggest that robotic-assisted magnetic tissue manipulation has the potential to improve ESD success rates while reducing procedure time, paving the way for further advancements in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery.

### [Learning Based Estimation of Tool-Tissue Interaction Forces for Stationary and Moving Environments]()

Accurately estimating tool-tissue interaction forces during robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery is an important aspect of enabling haptics-based teleoperation. By collecting data regarding the state of a robot in a variety of configurations, neural networks can be trained to predict this interaction force. This paper extends existing work in this domain based on collecting one of the largest known ground truth force datasets for stationary as well as moving phantoms that replicate tissue motions found in clinical procedures. Existing methods, and a new transformer-based architecture, are evaluated to demonstrate the domain gap between stationary and moving phantom tissue data and the impact that data scaling has on each architecture's ability to generalize the force estimation task. It was found that temporal networks were more sensitive to the moving domain than single-sample Feed Forward Networks (FFNs) that were trained on stationary tissue data. However, the transformer approach results in the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when evaluating networks trained on examples of both stationary and moving phantom tissue samples. The results demonstrate the domain gap between stationary and moving surgical environments and the effectiveness of scaling datasets for increased accuracy of interaction force prediction.

### [RASEC: Rescaling Acquisition Strategy with Energy Constraints under Fusion Kernel for Active Incision Recommendation in Tracheotomy (I)]()

Tracheotomy is critical for patients needing prolonged intubation or airway management, where accurate incision placement is essential to avoid complications. Current techniques rely on palpating cartilage landmarks, which can be imprecise. This paper presents RASEC, an autonomous palpation-based strategy that enhances robot-assisted tracheotomy by interactively predicting acquisition points to maximize information and minimize palpation costs. We employ a Gaussian Process (GP) to model the distribution of tissue hardness, integrating anatomical data as prior input to guide palpation. A dynamic tactile sensor, based on resonant frequency, measures tissue hardness with millimeter-scale contact for secure interaction. We use kernel fusion, combining the Squared Exponential (SE) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) kernels, to optimize Bayesian searches using laryngeal anatomical knowledge. The acquisition strategy also considers the tactile sensor’s movement distance and the robotic base link's rotation during incision localization. Simulations and physical experiments demonstrate a 53.1% reduction in sensor movement distance and a 75.2% improvement in rotation angle. The results yield an average precision of 0.932, recall of 0.973, and F1 score of 0.952, showcasing RASEC’s efficacy in exploration efficiency, cost awareness, and localization accuracy for tracheotomy procedures.

### [Locally Homotopic Paths: Ensuring Consistent Paths in Hierarchical Path Planning]()

We consider a local planner that utilizes model predictive control to locally deviate from a prescribed global path in response to dynamic environments, taking into account the system dynamics. To ensure the consistency between the local and global paths, we introduce the concept of locally homotopic paths for paths with different origins and destinations. We then formulate a hard constraint to ensure that local paths are locally homotopic to a given global path. Additionally, we propose a cost function to penalize any violation of this requirement rather than completely prohibiting it. Experimental results show that both variants of our approach are more resilient to localization errors compared to existing methods that represent the homotopy class constraint as an envelope around the global path.

### [Multi-Covering a Point Set by M Disks with Minimum Total Area]()

A common robotics sensing problem is to place sensors to robustly monitor a set of assets, where robustness is assured by requiring asset p to be monitored by at least kappa(p) sensors. Given n assets that must be observed by m sensors, each with a disk-shaped sensing region, where should the sensors be placed to minimize the total area observed?	We provide and analyze a fast heuristic for this problem. We then use the heuristic to initialize an exact Integer Programming solution. Subsequently, we enforce separation constraints between the sensors by modifying the integer program formulation and by changing the disk candidate set.

### [Non-Conservative Obstacle Avoidance for Multi-Body Systems Leveraging Convex Hulls and Predicted Closest Points]()

This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates future closest point predictions into the distance constraints of a collision avoidance controller, leveraging convex hulls with closest point distance calculations. By addressing abrupt shifts in closest points, this method effectively reduces collision risks and enhances controller performance. Applied to an Image Guided Therapy robot and validated through simulations and user experiments, the framework demonstrates improved distance prediction accuracy, smoother trajectories, and safer navigation near obstacles.

### [Adaptive Distance Functions Via Kelvin Transformation]()

The term safety in robotics is often understood as a synonym for avoidance. Although this perspective has led to progress in path planning and reactive control, a generalization of this perspective is necessary to include task semantics relevant to contact-rich manipulation tasks, especially during teleoperation and to ensure the safety of learned policies. We introduce the semantics-aware distance function and a corresponding computational method based on the Kelvin Transformation. This allows us to compute smooth distance approximations in an unbounded domain by instead solving a Laplace equation in a bounded domain. The semantics-aware distance generalizes signed distance functions by allowing the zero level set to lie inside of the object in regions where contact is allowed, effectively incorporating task semantics, such as object affordances, in an adaptive implicit representation of safe sets. In numerical experiments we show the computational viability of our method for real applications and visualize the computed function on a wrench with various semantic regions.

### [A Quantum Annealing Approach to Target Tracking]()

This paper delves into the fusion of quantum computing and robotics, focusing on motion planning in cluttered environments. Traditional algorithms struggle with complex problems where many constraints need to be satisfied. Hence, optimization-based approaches such as Constrained Quadratic Models (CQM) have become increasingly popular. Our work presents a 3D tracking algorithm based on CQM uniquely adapted for quantum computers to address computational challenges. With their parallel processing capabilities, Quantum computers offer a groundbreaking approach to optimizing complex problems. We formulate the CQM problem for efficient resolution on the D-Wave quantum computer, showcasing its superiority over classical counterparts. Our application centers on real-time planning in a target-chaser tracking scenario, highlighting the quantum advantage in handling the computation complexity of constrained problems. This paper bridges the quantum-robotics gap and sets the stage for future research in quantum-enhanced robotic motion planning.

### [Provable Methods for Searching with an Imperfect Sensor]()

Assume that a target is known to be present at an unknown point among a finite set of locations in the plane. We search for it using a mobile robot that has imperfect sensing capabilities. It takes time for the robot to move between locations and search a location; we have a total time budget within which to conduct the search. We study the problem of computing a search path/strategy for the robot that maximizes the probability of detection of the target. Considering non-uniform travel times between points (e.g., based on the distance between them) is crucial for search and rescue applications; such problems have been investigated to a limited extent due to their inherent complexity. In this paper, we describe fast algorithms with performance guarantees for this search problem and some variants, complement them with complexity results, and perform experiments to observe their performance.

### [Emergence of Collective Behaviors for the Swarm Robotics through Visual Attention-Based Selective Interaction]()

Plenty of local interaction mechanisms have been proposed to achieve collective behaviors in swarm robotics. However, these mechanisms require robots to explicitly obtain the velocity of their neighbors as the sensory input to make motion decisions. This further poses great challenges in real-world applications of swarm robotics. In this letter, inspired by the chasing behavior in large-scale migrating locusts, we propose a visual attention-based model to achieve collective behaviors with positional interaction. Through numerical simulations, we find the emergence of three typical collective behaviors: flocking, milling and swarming. To gain deep insights into the new proposed model, we investigate the impact of group size and sensory blindness on the emergence of collective behaviors. Moreover, by using the mean field analysis framework, we present the theoretical proof of the emergence of flocking and milling behavior. Furthermore, to validate the feasibility of our proposed model, we reproduce the flocking and milling behavior with up to 50 physical robots. Robotic experiments demonstrate the promising ability of the new proposed model to achieve collective behaviors with the absence of velocity alignment.

### [Safe Radial Segregation Algorithm for Swarms of Dubins-Like Robots]()

This work addresses the problem of radially segregating heterogeneous robotic swarms. Such swarms are those composed of different groups of robots. Unlike other works on segregation in the literature, we propose a controller for Dubins-like robots, motivated by autonomous aerial, wheeled, and underwater vehicles. Our controller can drive the robots individually to converge to circles that are shared only by robots of the same group. We present a heuristic and a collision avoidance scheme in which the information required is locally acquired. We present several simulations widely varying the number of robots per group and the number of groups in which segregation is always reached and collisions between robots are always avoided.

### [Impossibility of Self-Organized Aggregation without Computation]()

In their seminal work, Gauci et al. (2014) studied the fundamental task of aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori agreed-upon meeting location, using extremely limited hardware. That paper considered differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover, the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether there exists a controller that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation proof of the aforementioned paper for two robots and present an alternative controller alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.

### [Learning Adversarial Policies for Swarm Leader Identification Using a Probing Agent]()

This study introduces a novel approach to swarm leader identification (SLI) in multi-agent robot systems by employing a physical adversary interacting with the swarm in the same environment. We develop a new simulation environment to study the SLI problem and train an adversary, which we term the prober, to solve the SLI problem using forceful interactions with the swarm as its guiding information source. The prober's policy is modeled using the simplified structure state space sequence (S5) model and trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The prober only has access to the information on the relative positions of the other agents. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations using two performance metrics and validate the sim-to-real transfer through robot experiments. Results on evaluating the performance in 10,000 different testing scenarios demonstrate that our method finds the leader's identity in the vast majority (95.7%) of the cases, regardless of the initial leader selection during training. The proposed system represents the first instance of learning-based automatic identification of leader agents in a swarm. This capability is crucial for enabling efficient and robust human-swarm interaction, understanding artificial swarm behaviors, and analyzing latent behaviors in biological swarms in nature.

### [Realizing Emergent Collective Behaviors through Robotic Swarmalators]()

Swarmalators move as a function of their pairwise phase interactions, and control their phase as a function of their relative position or motion to other agents. This enables dual sync and swarm behaviors that mimic those exhibited by diverse natural and artificial swarms; these behaviors have almost entirely been explored only through computational simulations. Here, we realize through a 15-robot collective many of the predicted swarmalator behaviors when agents are chiral and non-chiral, when there is frequency coupling, and when the natural frequency distribution is homogeneous and heterogeneous. This work presents an experimental platform that can realize many theoretically predicted collective behaviors, it sheds light on the differences between the simulations and experiments, and it will serve in future studies to realize swarmalator and active matter collective behaviors.

### [Speed and Density Planning for a Speed-Constrained Robot Swarm through a Virtual Tube]()

The planning and control of a robot swarm in a complex environment has attracted increasing attention. To this end, the concept of virtual tubes has been taken up in our previous work. Specifically, a virtual tube with varying widths has been planned to avoid collisions with obstacles in a complex environment. Based on the planned virtual tube for a large number of speed-constrained robots, the average forward speed and density along the virtual tube are further planned in this paper to improve safety and efficiency. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method is founded upon global information and can is applicable to traversing confined spaces for speed-constrained robot swarms. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to show that the safety and efficiency of the passing-through process are improved. A video about the simulations and experiments is available at https://youtu.be/F3Xg1vUcxws.

### [Let Me Help You! Neuro-Symbolic Short-Context Action Anticipation]()

In an era where robots become available to the general public, the applicability of assistive robotics extends across numerous aspects of daily life, including in-home robotics. This work presents a novel approach for such systems, leveraging long-horizon action anticipation from short-observation contexts. In an assistive cooking task, we demonstrate that predicting human intention leads to effective collaboration between humans and robots. Compared to prior approaches, our method halves the required observation time of human behavior before accurate future predictions can be made, thus, allowing for quick and effective task support from short contexts. To provide sufficient context in such scenarios, our proposed method analyzes the human user and their interaction with surrounding scene objects by imbuing the system with additional domain knowledge, encoding the scene object's affordances. We integrate this knowledge into a transformer-based action anticipation architecture, which alters the attention mechanism between different visual features by either boosting or attenuating the attention between them. Through this approach, we achieve an up to 9% improvement on two common action anticipation benchmarks, namely 50Salads and Breakfast. After predicting a sequence of future actions, our system selects an appropriate assistive action that is subsequently executed on a robot for a joint salad preparation task between a human and a robot.

### [Evaluating Robotic Performative Autonomy in Collaborative Contexts Impacted by Latency]()

Maintaining Situational Awareness (SA) is critical in space exploration contexts, yet made particularly difficult due to the presence of communication latency. In order to increase human SA without inducing cognitive overload, researchers have proposed Performative Autonomy (PA), in which robots intentionally interact at a lower level of autonomy than they are capable of. While researchers have demonstrated positive impacts of PA on team performance even under high latency, previous work on PA has not examined how the benefits of PA might be mediated by latency. In this work, we thus evaluate the impact of latency and PA on trust, SA, and human perceptions of robot intelligence and autonomy. Our results suggest that lower performed autonomy leads to increased cognitive load, especially when robot communication happens frequently and latency is present. In addition, we observe no effect of the PA strategies used within our experimental paradigm on SA, and instead find evidence that operating under high latency leads to negative perceptions of robots regardless of choice of PA strategy.

### [SYNERGAI: Perception Alignment for Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in facilitating human-robotic interaction and collaboration. However, existing LLM-based systems often overlook the misalignment between human and robot perceptions, which hinders their effective communication and real-world robot deployment. To address this issue, we introduce SYNERGAI, a unified system designed to achieve both perceptual alignment and human-robot collaboration. At its core, SYNERGAI employs 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) as its explicit and innate representation. This enables the system to leverage LLM to break down complex tasks and allocate appropriate tools in intermediate steps to extract relevant information from the 3DSG, modify its structure, or generate responses. Importantly, SYNERGAI incorporates an automatic mechanism that enables perceptual misalignment correction with users by updating its 3DSG in real-time. In a zero-shot manner, SYNERGAI achieves comparable performance with the data-driven models in ScanQA. Through comprehensive experiments across 10 real-world scenes, SYNERGAI demonstrates its effectiveness in establishing common ground with humans, realizing a success rate of 61.9% in alignment tasks. It also significantly improves the success rate from 3.7% to 45.68% on novel tasks by transferring the knowledge acquired during alignment.

### [Digital Model-Driven Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing Layout and Task Allocation in Human-Robot Collaborative Assemblies]()

This paper addresses the optimization of human-robot collaborative work-cells before their physical deployment. Most of the times, such environments are designed based on the experience of the system integrators, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. Accurate simulators of the robotic cell, accounting for the presence of the human as well, are available today and can be used in the pre-deployment. We propose an iterative optimization scheme where a digital model of the work-cell is updated based on a genetic algorithm. The methodology focuses on the layout optimization and task allocation, encoding both the problems simultaneously in the design variables handled by the genetic algorithm, while the task scheduling problem depends on the result of the upper-level one. The final solution balances conflicting objectives in the fitness function and is validated to show the impact of the objectives with respect to a baseline, which represents possible initial choices selected based on the human judgement.

### [Context-Aware Collaborative Pushing of Heavy Objects Using Skeleton-Based Intention Prediction]()

In physical human-robot interaction, force feedback has been the most common sensing modality to convey the human intention to the robot. It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatio-temporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency.

### [Interactive Distance Field Mapping and Planning to Enable Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Human-robot collaborative applications require scene representations that are kept up-to-date and facilitate safe motions in dynamic scenes. In this letter, we present an interactive distance field mapping and planning (IDMP) framework that handles dynamic objects and collision avoidance through an efficient representation. We define interactive mapping and planning as the process of creating and updating the representation of the scene online while simultaneously planning and adapting the robot's actions based on that representation. The key aspect of this work is an efficient Gaussian Process field that performs incremental updates and handles dynamic objects reliably by identifying moving points via a simple and elegant formulation based on queries from a temporary latent model. In terms of mapping, IDMP is able to fuse point cloud data from single and multiple sensors, query the free space at any spatial resolution, and deal with moving objects without semantics. In terms of planning, IDMP allows seamless integration with gradient-based reactive planners facilitating dynamic obstacle avoidance for safe human-robot interactions. Our mapping performance is evaluated on both real and synthetic datasets. A comparison with similar state-of-the-art frameworks shows superior performance when handling dynamic objects and comparable or better performance in the accuracy of the computed distance and gradient field. Finally, we show how the framework can be used for fast motion planning in the presence of moving objects both in simulated and real-world scenes. An accompanying video, code, and datasets are made publicly available.

### [A Stochastic Cloning Square-Root Information Filter with Accurate Feature Tracking for Visual-Inertial Odometry]()

In this work, we introduce an enhanced square-root information filter for visual-inertial odometry. This filter utilizes stochastic cloning, implemented via Gaussian elimination, to facilitate time offset calibration and feature anchor changes. By using single-precision numbers within the filter, we significantly reduce computational load and memory requirements. In addition, we employ a fast Mahalanobis distance test and block Householder triangulation to accelerate the calculations. To mitigate feature drift from frame-to-frame optical flow, we create keyframes at regular intervals and refine long-tracked features between them. We use affine optical flow to compensate for patch deformations induced by possible large spatial transformations between keyframes. An analytical approach to computing the affine transformation is proposed. Experiments conducted on real-world data show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a much faster speed.

### [Large-Scale UWB Anchor Calibration and One-Shot Localization Using Gaussian Process]()

Ultra-wideband (UWB) is gaining popularity with devices like AirTags for precise home item localization but faces significant challenges when scaled to large environments like seaports. The main challenges are calibration and localization in obstructed conditions, which are common in logistics environments. Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight (LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making large-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome these challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot localization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor position from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges. This approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of sampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 m². With the LoS issues, UWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known. We demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR loop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and speed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods, enabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports. It significantly improves precision in challenging environments where UWB-only and LiDAR-Inertial methods fall short. We will open-source our datasets and calibration codes for community use.

### [Online Identification of Skidding Modes with Interactive Multiple Model Estimation]()

Skid-steered wheel mobile robots (SSWMRs) operate in a variety of outdoor environments exhibiting motion behaviors dominated by the effects of complex wheel-ground interactions. Characterizing these interactions is crucial both from the immediate robot autonomy perspective (for motion prediction and control) as well as a long-term predictive maintenance and diagnostics perspective. An ideal solution entails capturing precise state measurements for decisions and controls, which is considerably difficult, especially in increasingly unstructured outdoor regimes of operations for these robots. In this milieu, a framework to identify pre-determined discrete modes of operation can considerably simplify the motion model identification process. To this end, we propose an interactive multiple model (IMM) based filtering framework to probabilistically identify predefined robot operation modes that could arise due to traversal in different terrains or loss of wheel traction.

### [RLCNet: A Novel Deep Feature-Matching-Based Method for Online Target-Free Radar-LiDAR Calibration]()

While millimeter-wave radars are widely used in robotics and autonomous driving, extrinsic calibration with other sensors remains challenging due to the sparsity and uncertainty of radar point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel deep feature-matching-based online extrinsic calibration approach for a 4D millimeter-wave radar and 3D LiDAR system. We formulate the calibration problem as a cross-modal point cloud registration task, initiating with keypointlevel matching followed by dense matching refinement. Efficient yet powerful neural networks are employed to extract prior keypoint matches, which are then expanded to surrounding regions, establishing dense point correspondences. Our approach effectively leverages the majority of the information from millimeter-wave radar, mitigating the impact of radar point cloud sparsity. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves an average improvement of 66.96% in calibration success rate, while reducing translational error and rotational error by 23.84% and 30.31%, respectively. Our implementation will be made open-source at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/RLCNet.

### [Universal Online Temporal Calibration for Optimization-Based Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems]()

6-Degree of Freedom (6DoF) motion estimation with a combination of visual and inertial sensors is a growing area with numerous real-world applications. However, precise calibration of the time offset between these two sensor types is a prerequisite for accurate and robust tracking. To address this, we propose a universal online temporal calibration strategy for optimization-based visual-inertial navigation systems. Technically, we incorporate the time offset as a state parameter in the optimization residual model to align the IMU state to the corresponding image timestamp using time offset, angular velocity and translational velocity. This allows the temporal misalignment to be optimized alongside other tracking states during the process. As our method only modifies the structure of the residual model, it can be applied to various optimization-based frameworks with different tracking frontends. We evaluate our calibration method with both EuRoC and simulation data and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate time offset estimation and faster convergence, particularly in the presence of noisy sensor data.The experimental code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/Ts_Online_Optimization.

### [Multi-Camera Hand-Eye Calibration for Human-Robot Collaboration in Industrial Robotic Workcells]()

In industrial scenarios, effective human-robot collaboration relies on multi-camera systems to robustly monitor human operators despite the occlusions that typically show up in a robotic workcell. In this scenario, precise localization of the person in the robot coordinate system is essential, making the hand-eye calibration of the camera network critical. This process presents significant challenges when high calibration accuracy should be achieved in short time to minimize production downtime, and when dealing with extensive camera networks used for monitoring wide areas, such as industrial robotic workcells. Our paper introduces an innovative and robust multi-camera hand-eye calibration method, designed to optimize each camera’s pose relative to both the robot’s base and to each other camera. This optimization integrates two types of key constraints: i) a single board-to-end-effector transformation, and ii) the relative camera-to-camera transformations. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method through comprehensive experiments employing the METRIC dataset and real-world data collected on industrial scenarios, showing notable advancements over state-of-the-art techniques even using less than 10 images. Additionally, we release an open-source version of our multi-camera hand-eye calibration algorithm at https://github.com/davidea97/Multi-Camera-Hand-Eye-Calibration.git.

### [EdgeCalib: Multi-Frame Weighted Edge Features for Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration]()

In multimodal perception systems, achieving precise extrinsic calibration between LiDAR and camera is of critical importance. However, the pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters may gradually drift during operation, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of the perception system. It is challenging to address this issue using methods based on artificial targets. In this article, we introduce an edge-based approach for automatic targetless calibration of LiDARs and cameras in real-world scenarios. The edge features, which are prevalent in various environments, are used to establish reliable correspondences in images and point clouds. Specifically, we leverage the Segment Anything Model to facilitate the extraction of stable and reliable image edge features. Then a multi-frame weighting strategy is used for feature filtering while alleviating the dependence on the environment. Finally, we estimate accurate extrinsic parameters based on edge correspondence constraints. Our method achieves a mean rotation error of 0.069 ◦ and a mean translation error of 1.037 cm on the KITTI dataset, outperforming existing edge-based calibration methods and demonstrating strong robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.

### [Gaussian Splatting Visual MPC for Granular Media Manipulation]()

Recent advancements in learned 3D representations have enabled significant progress in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, particularly for rigid-body objects. However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.

### [LE-Object: Language Embedded Object-Level Neural Radiance Fields for Open-Vocabulary Scene]()

Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly driven research in open-vocabulary 3D scene reconstruction, showcasing strong potential in open-set retrieval and semantic understanding. However, existing approaches face challenges in open-world environments: they either suffer from insufficient precision in semantic segmentation, leading to inadequate fine-grained scene understanding, or they are limited to object-level reconstruction, failing to capture intricate object details and lack applicability in open-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce LE-Object, an object-centric Neural Implicit Radiance Field (NeRF) method designed for open-world scenarios, aimed at achieving fine-grained scene understanding and high-fidelity object reconstruction. LE-Object integrates spatial features (SF) from object point clouds with visual features (VF) from VLMs to perform object association, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency in object mask segmentation, and extends VLM features from 2D images into 3D space, enabling precise open-world semantic inference and detailed object reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that LE-Object excels in zero-shot semantic segmentation and open-world object reconstruction, offering innovative solutions for global navigation and local object manipulation in open-world applications.

### [TranSplat: Surface Embedding-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transparent Object Manipulation]()

Transparent object manipulation remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications. We open-source synthetic dataset and model: https://github.com/jeongyun0609/TranSplat

### [NeuGrasp: Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction with Background Priors for Material-Agnostic Object Grasp Detection]()

Robotic grasping in cluttered environments with diverse materials, including transparent and specular surfaces, poses challenges for conventional depth-sensing methods. We introduce NeuGrasp, a neural surface reconstruction method that leverages background priors for material-agnostic grasp detection. NeuGrasp integrates transformers and global prior volumes to aggregate multi-view features with spatial encoding, enabling robust surface reconstruction even in highly narrow and sparse viewing conditions. Our innovative use of background priors enhances focus on foreground objects via residual feature enhancement and refines spatial perception with an occupancy-prior volume, particularly for transparent and specular objects. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings show NeuGrasp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in grasping while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. Moreover, NeuGrasp-RA (Reality Augmentation), a fine-tuned variant with small-scale real-world data, demonstrates strong domain adaptation, proving its robustness in practical scenarios.

### [Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian Splatting]()

We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner. However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes. For more information, please see our project page at https://arm.stanford.edu/next-best-sense.

### [Persistent Object Gaussian Splat (POGS) for Tracking Human and Robot Manipulation of Irregularly Shaped Objects]()

Tracking and manipulating irregularly-shaped, previously unseen objects in dynamic environments is important for robotic applications in manufacturing, assembly, and logistics. Recently introduced Gaussian Splats efficiently model object geometry, but lack persistent state estimation for task-oriented manipulation. We present Persistent Object Gaussian Splat (POGS), a system that embeds semantics, self-supervised visual features, and object grouping features into a compact representation that can be continuously updated to estimate the pose of scanned objects. POGS updates object states without requiring expensive rescanning or prior CAD models of objects. After an initial multi-view scene capture and training phase, POGS uses a single stereo camera to integrate depth estimates along with self-supervised vision encoder features for object pose estimation. POGS supports grasping, reorientation, and natural language-driven manipulation by refining object pose estimates, facilitating sequential object reset operations with human-induced object perturbations and tool servoing, where robots recover tool pose despite tool perturbations of up to 30°. POGS achieves up to 12 consecutive successful object resets and recovers from 80% of in-grasp tool perturbations.

### [Tactile Functasets: Neural Implicit Representations of Tactile Datasets]()

Modern incarnations of tactile sensors produce raw, high-dimensional data such as images, making it challenging to efficiently process and generalize across sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel representation for tactile sensor feedback based on neural implicit functions. Rather than directly using raw tactile images, we propose neural implicit functions trained to reconstruct the tactile dataset, producing compact neural representations that capture the underlying structure of the sensory inputs. These representations offer several advantages over their raw counterparts: they are compact, enable probabilistically interpretable inference, and facilitate generalization across different sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this representation on the downstream task of in-hand object pose estimation, achieving improved performance over image-based methods while simplifying downstream models.

### [I2D-Loc++: Camera Pose Tracking in LiDAR Maps with Multi-View Motion Flows]()

Camera localization in LiDAR maps has become increasingly popular due to its promising ability to handle complex scenarios, surpassing the limitations of visual-only localization methods. However, existing approaches mostly focus on addressing the cross-modal 2D-3D gaps while overlooking the relationship between adjacent image frames, which results in fluctuations and unreliability of camera poses. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel camera pose tracking framework in LiDAR maps by coupling the 2D-3D correspondences with 2D-2D feature matching (I2D-Loc++), which establishes the multi-view geometric constraints to improve localization stability and trajectory smoothness. Specifically, the framework consists of a front-end hybrid flow estimation network and a non-linear least square pose optimization module. We further design a cross-modal consistency loss to integrate the multi-view motion flows for the network training and the back-end pose optimization. The pose tracking model is trained on the KITTI odometry dataset, and tested on the KITTI odometry, Argoverse, Waymo and Lyft5 datasets, which demonstrates that I2D-Loc++ has superior performance and good generalization ability in improving the accuracy and robustness of camera pose tracking. Our code, pre-trained models, and online demos are available at https://github.com/EasonChen99/2D3DPoseTracking

### [LoFSORT: Sample Online and Real-Time Tracking in Low Frame Rate Scenarios]()

We propose a novel motion-based tracker specifically designed for tracking multiple people in low frame rate scenarios. While previous studies have predominantly focused on scenarios with high frame rates (exceeding 10 frames per second), tracking in low frame rate conditions is significant for robotic platforms with limited computational resources. Our tracker optimizes the cost function, cascade structure and Kalman filter correction to better adapt to the characteristics of low frame rate environments. First, we enhance the cost function by incorporating stable variables through the introduction of height-based and displacement-based cost terms. Second, we prioritize handling occlusion among individuals during association, which reduces ambiguity in subsequent tracking processes. Third, we utilize the error-compensated observation to correct the Kalman filter, thereby improving tracking accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed tracker, LoFSORT, outperforms other motion model-based trackers across various frame rate scenarios. Ablation studies further confirm that each component of our tracker enhances tracking performance in low frame rate scenarios

### [Multirotor Target Tracking through Policy Iteration for Visual Servoing]()

This paper presents a novel vision-based approach for tracking deformable contour targets using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) through combining image moments descriptor and a Policy Iteration scheme ensuring stability and generalization of knowledge to new tasks. This computationally efficient and optimal control scheme is suitable for diverse dynamic environments such as the surveillance and tracking of targets with evolving features. Due to the ability of the proposed scheme to comprehend an optimization output, the generated control sequence, from an offline successively approximated policy, makes the process less challenging. The proposed methodology is validated through extensive simulations and real-word experiments of environmental target surveillance using an octorotor UAV.

### [BiTrack: Bidirectional Offline 3D Multi-Object Tracking Using Camera-LiDAR Data]()

Compared with real-time multi-object tracking (MOT), offline multi-object tracking (OMOT) has the advantages to perform 2D-3D detection fusion, erroneous link correction, and full track optimization but has to deal with the challenges from bounding box misalignment and track evaluation, editing, and refinement. This paper proposes ``BiTrack'', a 3D OMOT framework that includes modules of 2D-3D detection fusion, initial trajectory generation, and bidirectional trajectory re-optimization to achieve optimal tracking results from camera-LiDAR data. The novelty of this paper includes threefold: (1) development of a point-level object registration technique that employs a density-based similarity metric to achieve accurate fusion of 2D-3D detection results; (2) development of a set of data association and track management skills that utilizes a vertex-based similarity metric as well as false alarm rejection and track recovery mechanisms to generate reliable bidirectional object trajectories; (3) development of a trajectory re-optimization scheme that re-organizes track fragments of different fidelities in a greedy fashion, as well as refines each trajectory with completion and smoothing techniques. The experiment results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that BiTrack achieves the state-of-the-art performance for 3D OMOT tasks in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

### [ConTrack3D: Contrastive Learning Contributes Concise 3D Multi-Object Tracking]()

Online object detection and tracking are crucial for embodied intelligence systems, including autonomous vehicles and robotics. Traditional approaches employ a pipeline structure to perform detection and tracking separately, which can not fully leverage the information from the detector. Moreover, most prior tracking methods rely on motion models such as constant velocity for state updates, which can lead to incorrect associations when the velocity estimates are inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose ConTrack3D, an end-to-end framework that jointly performs detection and tracking in a fully online manner. Specifically, ConTrack3D incorporates a Joint Encoder module to capture detection embeddings and a Temporal Extender module for data-driven state updates. By employing contrastive learning, ConTrack3D learns discriminative tracking representations for more accurate associations. ConTrack3D is evaluated on the nuScenes benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate its significant improvements in tracking performance.

### [LMH-MOT : A Light Multiple Hypothesis Framework for 3D Multi-Object Tracking]()

3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) is a key area in the field of autonomous driving. In systems that track by detection, the detection results of deep learning models will inevitably have FP(False Positives) and FN(False Nagatives), and detector always cannot continuously and accurately detect targets when facing obstacle occlusion and sensor blind spots. The task of 3D-MOT is to combine the discrete and disordered target detection results in time sequence into continuous and reliable tracks for use by downstream planning modules. At present, multi-target tracking algorithms in the field of autonomous driving are all based on single-hypothesis. In crowded scenarios, both false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) significantly increase, making it difficult for single-hypothesis-based tracking algorithms to accurately output tracks. Towards this end, we propose LMH-MOT, a light multiple hypothesis framework for 3D MOT. Specifically, LMH-MOT effectively handles complex data association problems in autonomous driving scenarios by generating and maintaining multiple sets of hypotheses. Recognizing the possibility of switching between different motion states of the object, we use multiple motion models to more accurately estimate the motion state of the same object at the same time, and select the best estimation result for output. Additionally, we introduce a data association method based on decision trees, making full use of various features of the track and greatly reducing false matches and missing matches. In order to ensure the real-time performance of the entire algorithm framework, we also use gibbs sampling to significantly reduce the calculation time. On the NuScenes dataset, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 76.2% AMOTA.

### [Towards Safe Mid-Air Drone Interception: Strategies for Tracking & Capture]()

A unique approach for the mid-air autonomous aerial interception of non-cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by a flying robot equipped with a net is presented in this paper. A novel interception guidance method dubbed Fast Response Proportional Navigation (FRPN) is proposed, designed to catch agile maneuvering targets while relying on onboard state estimation and tracking. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches in simulations using 100 different trajectories of the target with varying complexity comprising almost 14 hours of flight data, and FRPN demonstrates the shortest response time and the highest number of interceptions, which are key parameters of agile interception. To enable robust transfer from theory and simulation to a real-world implementation, we aim to avoid overfitting to specific assumptions about the target and to tackle interception of a target following an unknown general trajectory. Furthermore, we identify several often overlooked problems related to tracking and estimation of the target's state that can have a significant influence on the overall performance of the system. We propose the use of a novel state estimation filter based on the Interacting Multiple Model filter and a new measurement model. Simulated experiments show that the proposed solution provides significant improvements in estimation accuracy over the commonly employed Kalman Filter approaches when considering general trajectories. Based on these results, we employ the proposed filtering and guidance methods to implement a complete autonomous interception system, which is thoroughly evaluated in realistic simulations and tested in real-world experiments with a maneuvering target, going far beyond the performance of any state-of-the-art solution.

### [RISED: Accurate and Efficient RGB-Colorized Mapping Using Image Selection and Point Cloud Densification]()

Recent advances in robotics have underscored the critical role of colorized point clouds in enhancing environmental perception accuracy. However, conventional multi-sensor fusion Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems typically employ all available images indiscriminately for point cloud colorization, resulting in suboptimal outcomes with blurred textures. Notably, achieving precise texture-to-geometry alignment remains a challenge despite the availability of accurate pose estimation. This study introduces RISED, an advanced colorized mapping system that tackles this challenge from two perspectives: projection accuracy and distribution uniformity. For projection accuracy, we analyze the influence of camera poses on colorization and carefully select the optimal viewpoint to minimize errors. Regarding distribution uniformity, point cloud densification is applied to eliminate LiDAR scanning traces. Furthermore, a novel evaluation method is introduced to provide comprehensive assessment of colorized point clouds, filling a gap in this field. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional approaches in RGB-colorized mapping. Specifically, our method achieves notable improvements in projection accuracy (55.2%), geometric accuracy (63.1%), and surface coverage (30.8%).

### [Modeling Uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting through Continuous Semantic Splatting]()

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for probabilistically updating and rasterizing semantic maps within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Although previous methods have introduced algorithms which learn to rasterize features in 3D-GS for enhanced scene understanding, 3D-GS can fail without warning which presents a challenge for safety-critical robotic applications. To address this gap, we propose a method which advances the literature of continuous semantic mapping from voxels to ellipsoids, combining the precise structure of 3D-GS with the ability to quantify uncertainty of probabilistic robotic maps. Given a set of images, our algorithm performs a probabilistic semantic update directly on the 3D ellipsoids to obtain an expectation and variance through the use of conjugate priors. We also propose a probabilistic rasterization which returns per-pixel segmentation predictions with quantifiable uncertainty. We compare our method with similar probabilistic voxel-based methods to verify our extension to 3D ellipsoids, and perform ablation studies on uncertainty quantification and temporal smoothing.

### [OG-Gaussian: Occupancy Based Street Gaussians for Autonomous Driving]()

Accurate and realistic 3D scene reconstruction enables the lifelike creation of autonomous driving simulation environments. With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.

### [SMART: Advancing Scalable Map Priors for Driving Topology Reasoning]()

Topology reasoning is crucial for autonomous driving as it enables comprehensive understanding of connectivity and relationships between lanes and traffic elements. While recent approaches have shown success in perceiving driving topology using vehicle-mounted sensors, their scalability is hindered by the reliance on training data captured by consistent sensor configurations. We identify that the key factor in scalable lane perception and topology reasoning is the elimination of this sensor-dependent feature. To address this, we propose SMART, a scalable solution that leverages easily available standard-definition (SD) and satellite maps to learn a map prior model, supervised by large-scale geo-referenced high-definition (HD) maps independent of sensor settings. Attributing to scaled training, SMART alone achieves superior offline lane topology understanding using only SD and satellite inputs. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that SMART can be seamlessly integrated into any online topology reasoning method, yielding significant improvements by up to 28% on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark.

### [DynORecon: Dynamic Object Reconstruction for Navigation]()

This paper presents DynORecon, a Dynamic Object Reconstruction system that leverages the information provided by Dynamic SLAM to simultaneously generate a volumetric map of observed moving entities while estimating free space to support navigation. By capitalising on the motion estimations provided by Dynamic SLAM, DynORecon continuously refines the representation of dynamic objects to eliminate residual artefacts from past observations and incrementally reconstructs each object, seamlessly integrating new observations to capture previously unseen structures. Our system is highly efficient (∼20 FPS) and produces accurate (∼10 cm) object reconstructions using simulated and real-world outdoor datasets.

### [Ephemerality Meets LiDAR-Based Lifelong Mapping]()

Lifelong mapping is crucial for the long-term deployment of robots in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present ELite, an ephemerality-aided LiDAR-based lifelong mapping framework which can seamlessly align multiple session data, remove dynamic objects, and update maps in an end-to-end fashion. Map elements are typically classified as static or dynamic, but cases like parked cars indicate the need for more detailed categories than binary. Central to our approach is the probabilistic modeling of the world into two-stage ephemerality, which represent the transiency of points in the map within two different time scales. By leveraging the spatiotemporal context encoded in ephemeralities, ELite can accurately infer transient map elements, maintain a reliable up-to-date static map, and improve robustness in aligning the new data in a more fine-grained manner. Extensive real-world experiments on long-term datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system. The source code is publicly available for the robotics community: https://github.com/dongjae0107/ELite.

### [Addressing Diverging Training Costs Using BEVRestore for High-Resolution Bird's Eye View Map Construction]()

Recent advancements in Bird’s Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky motion planning like collision avoidance, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel BEVRestore mechanism. Specifically, our proposed model encodes the features of each sensor to LR BEV space and restores them to HR space to establish a memory-efficient map constructor. To this end, we introduce the BEV restoration strategy, which restores aliasing, and blocky artifacts of the up- scaled BEV features, and narrows down the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed mechanism provides a plug-and-play, memory-efficient pipeline, enabling an HR map construction with a broad BEV scope. Our code is available at https://github.com/minshu-kim/BEVRestore.

### [Smaller and Faster Robotic Grasp Detection Model Via Knowledge Distillation and Unequal Feature Encoding]()

In order to achieve higher accuracy, the complexity of grasp detection network increases accordingly with complicated model structures and tremendous parameters. Although various light-weight strategies are adopted, directly designing the compact network can be sub-optimal and difficult to strike the balance between accuracy and model size. To solve this problem, we explore a more efficient grasp detection model from two aspects: elaborately designing a light-weight network and performing knowledge distillation on the designed network. Specifically, based on the designed light-weight backbone, the features from RGB and D images with unequal effective grasping information rates are fully utilized and the information compensation strategies are adopted to make the model small enough while maintaining its accuracy. Then, the grasping features contained in the large teacher model are adaptively and effectively learned by our proposed method via knowledge distillation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to achieve comparable performance (98.9%, 93.1%, 82.3%, and 90.0% on Cornell, Jacquard, GraspNet, and MultiObj datasets respectively) with more complicate models while reducing the parameters from MBs to KBs. Real-world robotic grasping experiment in an embedded AI computing device also prove the effectiveness of this approach.

### [ViViDex: Learning Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation from Human Videos]()

In this work, we aim to learn a unified vision-based policy for multi-fingered robot hands to manipulate a variety of objects in diverse poses. Though prior work has shown benefits of using human videos for policy learning, performance gains have been limited by the noise in estimated trajectories. Moreover, reliance on privileged object information such as ground-truth object states further limits the applicability in realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework ViViDex to improve vision-based policy learning from human videos. It first uses reinforcement learning with trajectory guided rewards to train state-based policies for each video, obtaining both visually natural and physically plausible trajectories from the video. We then rollout successful episodes from state-based policies and train a unified visual policy without using any privileged information. We propose coordinate transformation to further enhance the visual point cloud representation, and compare behavior cloning and diffusion policy for the visual policy training. Experiments both in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate that ViViDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three dexterous manipulation tasks.

### [HuDOR: Bridging the Human to Robot Dexterity Gap through Object-Oriented Rewards]()

Training robots directly from human videos is an emerging area in robotics and computer vision. While there has been notable progress with two-fingered grippers, learning autonomous tasks without teleoperation remains a difficult problem for multi-fingered robot hands. A key reason for this difficulty is that a policy trained on human hands may not directly transfer to a robot hand with a different morphology. In this work, we present HuDOR, a technique that enables online finetuning of the policy by constructing a reward function from the human video. Importantly, this reward function is built using object-oriented rewards derived from off-the-shelf point trackers, which allows for meaningful learning signals even when the robot hand is in the visual observation, while the human hand is used to construct the reward. Given a single video of human solving a task, such as gently opening a music box, HuDOR allows our four-fingered Allegro hand to learn this task with just 30 minutes of online interaction. Our experiments across four tasks, show that HuDOR outperforms alternatives with an average of 4x improvement. Code and videos are available on our website website: https://object-rewards.github.io/.

### [Hand-Object Interaction Pre-Training from Videos]()

We present an approach to learn general robot manipulation priors from 3D hand-object interaction trajectories. We build a framework to use in-the-wild videos to generate sensorimotor robot trajectories. We do so by lifting both the human hand and the manipulated object in a shared 3D space and retargeting human motions to robot actions. Generative modeling on this data gives us a task-agnostic base policy. This policy captures a general yet flexible manipulation prior. We empirically demonstrate that finetuning this policy, with both reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC), enables sample-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks and simultaneously improves robustness and generalizability compared to alternate approaches.

### [SuperQ-GRASP: Superquadrics-Based Grasp Pose Estimation on Larger Objects for Mobile-Manipulation]()

Grasp planning and estimation have been a long-standing research problem in robotics, with two main approaches to find graspable poses on the objects: 1) geometric approach, which relies on 3D models of objects and the gripper to estimate valid grasp poses, and 2) data-driven, learning-based approach, with models trained to identify grasp poses from raw sensor observations. The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations. In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation.We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) - parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size. For more qualitative results, refer to the supplementary video and webpage https://bit.ly/3ZrOanU.

### [Collaborative Motion Planning for Multi-Manipulator Systems through Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Movement Primitives]()

Robotic tasks often require multiple manipulators to enhance task efficiency and speed, but this increases complexity in terms of collaboration, collision avoidance, and the expanded state-action space. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level approach combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) to generate adaptive, real-time trajectories for new tasks in dynamic environments using a demonstration library. This method ensures collision-free trajectory generation and efficient collaborative motion planning. We validate the approach through experiments in the PyBullet simulation environment with UR5e robotic manipulators.

### [Soft Robot Employing a Series of Pneumatic Actuators and Distributed Balloons: Modeling, Evaluation, and Applications]()

Tasks involving exploration and inspection of nar- row environments demand a robot to have a flexible body. Such a robot is especially preferred if the integrity of its surrounding is crucial, as in endoscopy procedures. We propose the design of a small, self-propelled soft robot that can operate in a constrained environment. By periodic activation of a series of pneumatic actu- ators fabricated using a casting technique, sinusoidal locomotion is achieved. The wave-like locomotive strategy with an additional support mechanism enabled movement in multiple scenarios, including traveling horizontally and vertically in environments of different characteristics. Two analytical models are presented to highlight the design characteristics. The first predicts the velocity of the robot in relation to the working conditions, while the second calculates the force that the robot body exerts on its sur- roundings. Its mobility was tested in simple and complex routes under rigid and elastic environments. The resulting percent errors for the predictions of velocity and lateral force are 7.89% and 16.86%, respectively. In terms of performance, the robot can move horizontally in rigid tubes even if

### [Compliance Control with Dynamic and Self-Sensing Hydraulic Artificial Muscles for Wearable Assistive Devices]()

While wearable robots that utilize intrinsically soft materials for actuation offer enhanced safety and biological compatibility, the challenges of sensing and control significantly affect their performance. The control problem in such systems is inherently complex, and the inclusion of ‘softness’ introduces additional nonlinearities, hysteresis, and uncertainties. Furthermore, the effectiveness of control strategies is highly dependent on sensor selection and integration, which presents its own challenges. Most robotic systems require separate sensors for control purposes. In this study, a new sensing and control scheme are introduced for soft wearable robots, leveraging the intrinsic soft-sensing capability of fluidic filament actuators without adding computational complexity. This method enables simultaneous sensing and actuation with 96% position accuracy, even under physical disturbances. This approach is demonstrated with a soft assistive device for elbow flexion/extension, achieving 70.5% tracking accuracy and a 0.09s response delay to human intention, ensuring the system provides minimal resistance when assistance is not needed, while delivering the required support when necessary.

### [Braided Artificial Muscle with Programmable Body Morphing and Its Application to Elbow Joint Flexion]()

For pneumatic artificial muscles, it is always considered the more maximum contraction ratio the better. While for human joint assisting applications, PAMs with configurable maximum contraction rate are more suitable because of advantageous safety and adaptability. A PAM based on planar-to-specific-wave body shape morph is proposed in this work. Shape-morphing-based braided artificial muscles (SBAMs) have uniqueness of initial elasticity and maximum contraction ration programmability, which meet the favors of human joint assisting applications. The basic structure and working mechanism of contraction in SBAMs will be explained, and their mathematical model will also be established. According to the experimental results, a SBAM prototype generates a force more than 140 times its weight under an easily accessible pressure of 150 kPa. A mannequin wearing the SBAM enables actively flexes its elbow over 120 °.

### [Physics-Informed Hybrid Modeling of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles]()

Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) are complex nonlinear systems characterized by hysteresis, making them challenging to model with classical system identification methods. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling nonlinear systems from data, purely neural network-based models often lack interpretability and are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, this study explores several hybrid approaches that combine analytical models with neural networks to model PAM behavior more effectively. The results demonstrate that hybrid models significantly outperform both purely analytical and black-box neural network models, particularly in terms of generalization and dynamic accuracy. Among the approaches, the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) unsupervised model shows the most robust performance, capturing complex PAM dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings suggest that hybrid modeling is a promising and scalable solution for accurately representing the intricate behavior of PAMs.

Soft robots are known for their ability to perform tasks with great adaptability, enabled by their distributed, non-uniform stiffness and actuation. Bending is the most fundamental motion for soft robot design, but creating robust, and easy-to-fabricate soft bending joint with tunable properties remains an active problem of research. In this work, we demonstrate an inflatable actuation module for soft robots with a defined bending plane enabled by forced partial wrinkling. This lowers the structural stiffness in the bending direction, with the final stiffness easily designed by the ratio of wrinkled and unwrinkled regions. We present models and experimental characterization showing the stiffness properties of the actuation module, as well as its ability to maintain the kinematic constraint over a large range of loading conditions. We demonstrate the potential for complex actuation in a soft continuum robot and for decoupling actuation force and efficiency from load capacity. The module provides a novel method for embedding intelligent actuation into soft pneumatic robots.

### [Enhancement of Thin McKibben Muscle Durability under Repetitive Actuation in a Bent State]()

The McKibben muscle can produce a high force-to-mass ratio, beneficial for various applications in the soft mechatronics field. The thin McKibben muscle, which has a small diameter, has the advantage of a high force-to-mass ratio and sufficient flexibility for use in a bent state. This flexibility permits the realization of flexible mechatronics. However, the thin McKibben muscle is easily broken in a bent state while it is very durable in a straight state. Over repetitive operations, the fibers within the sleeve gradually shift, causing the rubber tube inside to protrude and ultimately leading to cracking. This study investigates improvements in the durability of artificial muscles using adhesives to prevent this fiber-to-fiber misalignment. The durability test showed that the adhesive could provide a durability of up to 10,000-times greater than that of a normal artificial muscle in the maximum case. Using the thin McKibben muscle with the proposed method, tensegrity modules were fabricated. The durability test revealed a 500-fold increase under an applied pressure of 0.5 MPa. Furthermore, the durability of the adhesive-applied artificial muscles was also confirmed to be enhanced during the dynamic movements of a soft tensegrity robot that throws a ball with 0.7 MPa.

### [Camera-Based Online Vectorized HD Map Construction with Incomplete Observation]()

Camera-based online map construction focuses on learning map elements from surround-view images. Distinguished with previous methods that rely on complete observations, we explore a new map construction problem under incomplete observations where one or more perspectives of the surround-view are missing due to camera damage or occlusion. Incomplete observations lead to inferior performance and may even result in failure. Map construction based on incomplete observations faces two challenges: supplementing missing perspective features and reducing the complexity of high-dimensional feature learning. To address these issues, we propose a novel Panoramic Observation Prior Network (POP-Net). Firstly, based on the observation switch training mechanism, we propose a Panoramic Learning Module (PL-Module). It establishes a learnable panoramic feature space, facilitating the extraction of panoramic features from incomplete observations, thus supplementing missing perspective features. Secondly, based on the feature decomposition mechanism, we design a Panoramic Decomposition-Aggregation Operation (PDA-Operation), which decomposes high-dimensional panoramic features into low-dimensional local scene features. This allows limited local scene features to represent diverse panoramic features, alleviating computational and memory burdens of high-dimensional feature learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches under incomplete observation scenarios.

### [Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors]()

Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also go- ing beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose to treat each single trajectory predictor as an “expert” and maintain a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data –the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next time step– to form a convex-or- nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the LYFT dataset.

### [Gen-Drive: Enhancing Diffusion Generative Driving Policies with Reward Modeling and Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning]()

Autonomous driving necessitates the ability to reason about future interactions between traffic agents and to make informed evaluations for planning. This paper intro-duces the Gen-Drive framework, which shifts from the traditional prediction and deterministic planning framework to a generation-then-evaluation planning paradigm. The framework employs a behavior diffusion model as a scene generator to produce diverse possible future scenarios, thereby enhancing the capability for joint interaction reasoning. To facilitate decision-making, we propose a scene evaluator (reward) model, trained with pairwise preference data collected through VLM assistance, thereby reducing human workload and enhancing scalability. Furthermore, we utilize an RL fine-tuning frame-work to improve the generation quality of the diffusion model, rendering it more effective for planning tasks. We conduct training and closed-loop planning tests on the nuPlan dataset, and the results demonstrate that employing such a generation-then-evaluation strategy outperforms other learning-based approaches. Additionally, the fine-tuned generative driving policy shows significant enhancements in planning performance. We further demonstrate that utilizing our learned reward model for evaluation or RL fine-tuning leads to better planning performance compared to relying on human-designed rewards.

### [Optimizing Efficiency of Mixed Traffic through Reinforcement Learning: A Topology-Independent Approach and Benchmark]()

This paper presents a mixed traffic control policy designed to optimize traffic efficiency across diverse road topologies, addressing issues of congestion prevalent in urban environments. A model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach is developed to manage large-scale traffic flow, using data collected by autonomous vehicles to influence human-driven vehicles. A real-world mixed traffic control benchmark is also released, which includes 444 scenarios from 20 countries, representing a wide geographic distribution and covering a variety of scenarios and road topologies. This benchmark serves as a foundation for future research, providing a realistic simulation environment for the development of effective policies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method, achieving better performance than existing traffic control methods in both intersection and roundabout scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first project to introduce a real-world complex scenarios mixed traffic control benchmark. Videos and code of our work are available at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mixedtrafficplus/home .

### [Internal-Stably Energy-Saving Cooperative Control of Articulated Wheeled Robot with Distributed Drive Units]()

Articulated wheeled robots play a crucial role in the logistics industry. However, conventional tractor-driven articulated wheeled robots exhibit poor internal stability and are prone to jackknifing, while also consuming a significant amount of energy. By deploying distributed drives and coordinating control among multiple drives, these issues can be effectively addressed. However, the flexible connections between the bodies of articulated vehicles pose significant challenges to the coordinated control of distributed drives. This paper proposes a multi-drive unit coordinated control algorithm based on driving force equivalence and allocation. A neural network is used to predict the driving force, and through nonlinear driving force equivalence, a feedforward driving force is obtained. This is combined with a closed-loop feedback compensation controller to form a control architecture that integrates feedforward and feedback, resulting in the equivalent total driving force for the vehicle queue. Subsequently, an equivalent distribution strategy allocates the required driving force to each drive, enabling the vehicle bodies to achieve accurate and stable speed tracking while allowing each drive to operate near its efficient operating point, thereby reducing total energy consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly lowers the total energy consumption of the vehicle queue under standard operating conditions while ensuring speed-tracking accuracy and improving internal stability.

### [Fast-Poly: A Fast Polyhedral Algorithm for 3D Multi-Object Tracking]()

3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) captures stable and comprehensive motion states of surrounding obstacles, essential for robotic perception. However, current 3D trackers face issues with accuracy and latency consistency. In this paper, we propose Fast-Poly, a fast and effective filter-based method for 3D MOT. Building upon our previous work Poly-MOT, Fast-Poly addresses object rotational anisotropy in 3D space, enhances local computation densification, and leverages parallelization technique, improving inference speed and precision. Fast-Poly is extensively tested on two large-scale tracking benchmarks with Python implementation. On the nuScenes dataset, Fast-Poly achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% AMOTA among all methods and can run at 34.2 FPS on a personal CPU. On the Waymo dataset, Fast-Poly exhibits competitive accuracy with 63.6% MOTA and impressive inference speed (35.5 FPS). The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lixiaoyu2000/FastPoly.

### [Importance Sampling-Guided Meta-Training for Intelligent Agents in Highly Interactive Environments]()

Training intelligent agents to navigate highly interactive environments presents significant challenges. While guided meta reinforcement learning (RL) approach that first trains a guiding policy to train the ego agent has proven effective in improving generalizability across scenarios with various levels of interaction, the state-of-the-art method tends to be overly sensitive to extreme cases, impairing the agents' performance in the more common scenarios. This study introduces a novel training framework that integrates guided meta RL with importance sampling (IS) to optimize training distributions iteratively for navigating highly interactive driving scenarios, such as T-intersections or roundabouts. Unlike traditional methods that may underrepresent critical interactions or overemphasize extreme cases during training, our approach strategically adjusts the training distribution towards more challenging driving behaviors using IS proposal distributions and applies the importance ratio to de-bias the result. By estimating a naturalistic distribution from real-world datasets and employing a mixture model for iterative training refinements, the framework ensures a balanced focus across common and extreme driving scenarios. Experiments conducted with both synthetic and naturalistic datasets demonstrate both accelerated training and performance improvements under highly interactive driving tasks.

### [Design and Modeling of a Compact Spooling Mechanism for the COAST Guidewire Robot]()

The treatment of many intravascular procedures begins with a clinician manually placing a guidewire to the target lesion to aid in placing other devices. Manually steering the guidewire is challenging due to the lack of direct tip control and the high tortuosity of vessel structures, potentially resulting in vessel perforation or guidewire fracture. These challenges can be alleviated through the use of robotically steerable guidewires that can improve guidewire tip control, provide force feedback, and, similar to commercial guidewires, are inherently safe due to their compliant structure. However, robotic guidewires are not yet clinically viable due to small robot lengths or large actuation systems. In this paper, we develop a highly compact spooling mechanism for the COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot, capable of dispensing a clinically viable length of 1.5 m of the robotic guidewire. The mechanism utilizes a spool with several interior armatures to actuate each component of the COAST guidewire. The kinematics of the robotic guidewire are then modeled considering additional friction forces caused by interactions within the mechanism. The actuating mechanisms of the compact spooling mechanism are calibrated and the kinematics of the guidewire are validated resulting in an average curvature RMSE of 0.24 m−1.

### [Motion-Guided Dual-Camera Tracker for Endoscope Tracking and Motion Analysis in a Mechanical Gastric Simulator]()

Flexible endoscope motion tracking and analysis in mechanical simulators have proven useful for endoscopy training. Common motion tracking methods based on electromagnetic tracker are however limited by their high cost and material susceptibility. In this work, the motion-guided dual-camera vision tracker is proposed to provide robust and accurate tracking of the endoscope tip's 3D position. The tracker addresses several unique challenges of tracking flexible endoscope tip inside a dynamic, life-sized mechanical simulator. To address the appearance variation and keep dual-camera tracking consistency, the cross-camera mutual template strategy (CMT) is proposed by introducing dynamic transient mutual templates. To alleviate large occlusion and light-induced distortion, the Mamba-based motion-guided prediction head (MMH) is presented to aggregate historical motion with visual tracking. The proposed tracker achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art vision trackers, achieving 42% and 72% improvements against the second-best method in average error and maximum error. Further motion analysis involving novice and expert endoscopists also shows that the tip 3D motion provided by the proposed tracker enables more reliable motion analysis and more substantial differentiation between different expertise levels, compared with other trackers.

### [A System for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Featuring Concentric Push-Pull Manipulators]()

Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is an effective minimally invasive approach to removing colon cancer, yet it is underutilized, since it is challenging to learn and perform. To promote the adoption of ESD by making it easier, we propose a system in which two small, flexible robotic manipulators are delivered through a colonoscope. Our system differs from prior robotic systems aimed at this application in that our manipulators are small enough to fit through a clinically used colonoscope. By not re-engineering the colonoscope, we maintain overall system diameter at the current clinical gold standard, and streamline the path to eventual clinical deployment. Our concentric push-pull robot (CPPR) manipulators offer dexterity and simultaneously provide a conduit for grasper or cutting tool deployment. Each manipulator in our system consists of two push-pull tube pairs, and we describe how they are actuated. We describe for the first time our approach to compensating for undesirable CPPR tip motion induced by differences in the tubes' transmission stiffness. We also evaluate the workspace of the manipulators and demonstrate teleoperation in a point-touching experiment. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of the system to resect tissue via ex vivo animal experiments.

### [Quantitative Evaluation of Curved BioPrinted Constructs of an in Situ Robotic System towards Treatment of Volumetric Muscle Loss]()

Tissue engineering techniques and particularly in situ bioprinting using handheld devices and robotic systems have recently demonstrated promising outcomes to address volumetric muscle loss injuries. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from insufficient printing precision and/or lack of quantitative analysis of the thickness and uniformity of bioprinted constructs (BPCs) - which are critical for ensuring cell viability and growth. To address these limitations, in this study, we present a framework for robotic bioprinting and complementary vision-based algorithms to quantitatively analyze thickness and uniformity of BPCs with curved geometries. The performance of the proposed robotic bioprinting and complementary algorithms has been thoroughly evaluated using various simulation and experimental studies on BPCs with constant and variable thicknesses. The results clearly demonstrate the remarkable and accurate performance of the proposed method in calculating the thickness and its variations along the geometry of the BPCs.

### [Design and Hysteresis Compensation of a Telerobotic System for Transesophageal Echocardiography]()

Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) plays an important role in diagnosing cardiac conditions such as valvular diseases and cardiac embolism, as well as guiding various cardiac interventions. It provides detailed cardiac imaging by inserting a probe into the esophagus, which offers an unobstructed view of the heart’s chambers and valves. Addressing the operational challenges and health risks of the sonographer associated with the manual procedure, a novel robotic TEE system is developed to teleoperate the TEE probe across all four degrees of freedom (4-DoFs). This actuation device features an easily assembled design for post-operative cleaning and sanitization. Moreover, this system enhances the precision of tip bending angles through an optimization technique for offline calibration of the actuation plane. The hysteresis effect inherent in the tendon-driven mechanism is characterized and compensated using a free knots B-spline method and a look-up table. Experiments are conducted in a realistic human cardiovascular phantom for preclinical evaluation. Repeatability experiments validate the system’s robustness. Furthermore, compared with the piecewise linear model, the proposed method achieves high accuracy with a median bending angle error of less than 0.8◦. The results demonstrate the system’s potential to significantly improve the autonomy of TEE procedures in cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

### [A Magnetic Capsule Robot with an Exoskeleton to Withstand Esophageal Pressure and Delivery Drug in Stomach]()

Capsule medicine is one of the most widely used methods of drug delivery into the human digestive tract. Packaging drugs into capsules not only prevents contamination of the drug before reaching the destination, but also protects the digestive organs and respiratory tract from potential damages caused by drug reactions. After reaching the targeted digestive organs, the drugs in the orally taken capsules usually can only be released passively. Most capsule robots that have been proposed to release drugs actively did not consider the compressed pressure when they pass through the esophagus, which could lead to premature drug release. This letter proposes a magnetic capsule robot that can withstand intra-esophageal pressure and also has the advantages of active locomotion and on-demand drug releasing. The proposed robot consists of two permanent magnets, an exoskeleton, and a soft non-magnetic container. Thus, it can withstand intra-esophageal pressure when it passes through the esophagus. This capsule robot can enter the stomach for targeted drug releasing without leaking liquid drugs along the path. The behavior of the robot is controllable using an external magnetic field thanks to the ring-shaped magnets mounted on the robot's top and bottom sections. The non-magnetic drug container will not be influenced by the external magnetic field during the locomotion to prevent leakage. The experiments show that this proposed capsule robot is more relevant to real-world medical applications thanks to its unique capability to withstand esophageal pressure.

### [MINRob: A Large Force-Outputting Miniature Robot Based on a Triple-Magnet System]()

Magnetically actuated miniature robots are limited in their mechanical outputting capability, because the magnetic forces decrease significantly with decreasing robot size and increasing actuating distance. Hence, the output force of these robots can hardly meet the demand for specific biomedical applications (e.g., tissue penetration). This article proposes a tetherless magnetic impact needle robot (MINRob) based on a triple-magnet system with reversible and repeatable magnetic collisions to overcome this constraint on output force. The working procedure of the proposed system is divided into several states, and a mathematical model is developed to predict and optimize the force output. Measured force values indicate a 10-fold increase compared with existing miniature robots that only utilize magnetic attractive force. Eventually, MINRob is integrated with a teleoperation system, enabling remote and precise control of the robot's position and orientation. The triple-magnet system offers promising locomotion patterns and penetration capacity via the notably increased force output, showing great potential in robot-assisted tissue penetration in minimally invasive healthcare.

### [Model-Free Safety Filter for Soft Robots: A Q-Learning Approach]()

Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents significant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or unavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple, plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering out their potentially unsafe actions. Due to its model-free nature and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL algorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double integrator and Dubin’s car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.

### [Reachability Analysis for Black-Box Dynamical Systems]()

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful framework for ensuring safety and performance in autonomous systems. However, existing methods typically rely on a white-box dynamics model of the system, limiting their applicability in many practical robotics scenarios where only a black-box model of the system is available. In this work, we propose a novel reachability method to compute reachable sets and safe controllers for black-box dynamical systems. Our approach efficiently approximates the Hamiltonian function using samples from the black-box dynamics. This Hamiltonian is then used to solve the HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE), providing the reachable set of the system. The proposed method can be applied to general nonlinear systems and can be seamlessly integrated with existing reachability toolboxes for white-box systems to extend their use to black-box systems. Through simulation studies on a black-box slip-wheel car and a quadruped robot, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately obtaining the reachable sets for black-box dynamical systems.

### [SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Systems]()

Behavior cloning (BC) is a widely used approach in imitation learning, where a robot learns a control policy by observing an expert supervisor. However, the learned policy can make errors and might lead to safety violations, which limits their utility in safety-critical robotics applications. While prior works have tried improving a BC policy via additional real or synthetic action labels, adversarial training, or runtime filtering, none of them explicitly focus on reducing the BC policy's safety violations during training time. We propose SAFE-GIL, a design-time method to learn safety-aware behavior cloning policies. SAFE-GIL deliberately injects adversarial disturbance in the system during data collection to guide the expert towards safety-critical states. This disturbance injection simulates potential policy errors that the system might encounter during the test time. By ensuring that training more closely replicates expert behavior in safety-critical states, our approach results in safer policies despite policy errors during the test time. We further develop a reachability-based method to compute this adversarial disturbance. We compare SAFE-GIL with various behavior cloning techniques and online safety-filtering methods in three domains: autonomous ground navigation, aircraft taxiing, and aerial navigation on a quadrotor testbed. Our method demonstrates a significant reduction in safety failures, particularly in low data regimes where the likelihood of learning errors, and therefore safety violations, is higher.

### [Computationally and Sample Efficient Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Adaptive Conformal Prediction]()

Safety is a critical concern in learning-enabled autonomous systems especially when deploying these systems in real-world scenarios. An important challenge is accurately quantifying the uncertainty of unknown models to generate provably safe control policies that facilitate the gathering of informative data, thereby achieving both safe and optimal policies. Additionally, the selection of the data-driven model can significantly impact both the real-time implementation and the uncertainty quantification process. In this paper, we propose a provably sample efficient episodic safe learning framework that remains robust across various model choices with quantified uncertainty for online control tasks. Specifically, we first employ Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) for kernel function approximation of Gaussian Processes (GPs) to enable efficient approximation of unknown dynamics. Then the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) is used to quantify the uncertainty from online observations and combined with the Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to characterize the uncertainty-aware safe control constraints under learned dynamics. Finally, an optimism-based exploration strategy is integrated with ACP-based CBFs for safe exploration and near-optimal safe nonlinear control. Theoretical proofs and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

### [Guaranteed Reach-Avoid for Black-Box Systems through Narrow Gaps Via Neural Network Reachability]()

In the classical reach-avoid problem, autonomous mobile robots are tasked to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. However, it is difficult to provide guarantees on the robot's performance when the obstacles form a narrow gap and the robot is a black-box (i.e. the dynamics are not known analytically, but interacting with the system is cheap). To address this challenge, this paper presents NeuralPARC. The method extends the authors' prior Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to systems modeled by rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks, which are trained to represent parameterized trajectory data demonstrated by the robot. NeuralPARC computes the reachable set of the network while accounting for modeling error, and returns a set of states and parameters with which the black-box system is guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles. NeuralPARC is shown to outperform PARC, generating provably-safe extreme vehicle drift parking maneuvers in simulations and in real life on a model car, as well as enabling safety on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to large disturbances and controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

### [RAIL: Reachability-Aided Imitation Learning for Safe Policy Execution]()

Imitation learning (IL) has shown great success in learning complex robot manipulation tasks. However, there remains a need for practical safety methods to justify widespread deployment. In particular, it is important to certify that a system obeys hard constraints on unsafe behavior in settings when it is unacceptable to design a tradeoff between performance and safety via tuning the policy (i.e. soft constraints). This leads to the question, how does enforcing hard constraints impact the performance (meaning safely completing tasks) of an IL policy? To answer this question, this paper builds a reachability-based safety filter to enforce hard constraints on IL, which we call Reachability-Aided Imitation Learning (RAIL). Through evaluations with state-of-the-art IL policies in mobile robots and manipulation tasks, we make two key findings. First, the highest-performing policies are sometimes only so because they frequently violate constraints, and significantly lose performance under hard constraints. Second, surprisingly, hard constraints on the lower-performing policies can occasionally increase their ability to perform tasks safely. Finally, hardware evaluation confirms the method can operate in real time. More results can be found at our website: https://safe-robotics-lab-gt.github.io/rail/.

### [Safe Reinforcement Learning of Robot Trajectories in the Presence of Moving Obstacles]()

In this paper, we present an approach for learning collision-free robot trajectories in the presence of moving obstacles. As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.

### [Decision Making for Multi-Robot Fixture Planning Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (I)]()

Within the realm of flexible manufacturing, fixture layout planning allows manufacturers to rapidly deploy optimal fixturing plans that can reduce surface deformation that leads to crack propagation in components during manufacturing tasks. The role of fixture layout planning has evolved from being performed by experienced engineers to computational methods due to the number of possible configurations for components. Current optimisation methods commonly fall into sub-optimal positions due to the existence of local optima, with data-driven machine learning techniques relying on costly to collect labelled training data. In this paper, we present a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with team decision theory to find optimal fixturing plans for manufacturing tasks. We demonstrate our approach on two representative aerospace components with complex geometries across a set of drilling tasks, illustrating the capabilities of our method; we will compare this against state of the art methods to showcase our method’s improvement at finding optimal fixturing plans with 3 times the improvement in deformation control within tolerance bounds.

### [Reference-Free Formula Drift with Reinforcement Learning: From Driving Data to Tire Energy-Inspired, Real-World Policies]()

The skill to drift a car--i.e., operate in a state of controlled oversteer like professional drivers-- could give future autonomous cars maximum flexibility when they need to retain control in adverse conditions or avoid collisions. We investigate real-time drifting strategies that put the car where needed while bypassing expensive trajectory optimization. To this end, we design a reinforcement learning agent that builds on the concept of tire energy absorption to autonomously drift through changing and complex waypoint configurations while safely staying within track bounds. We achieve zero-shot deployment on the car by training the agent in a simulation environment built on top of a neural stochastic differential equation vehicle model learned from pre-collected driving data. Experiments on a Toyota GR Supra and Lexus LC 500 show that the agent is capable of drifting smoothly through varying waypoint configurations with tracking error as low as 10 cm while stably pushing the vehicles to sideslip angles of up to 63°.

### [FLaRe: Achieving Masterful and Adaptive Robot Policies with Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning]()

In recent years, the Robotics field has initiated several efforts toward building generalist robot policies through large-scale multi-task Behavior Cloning (BC). However, direct deployments of these policies have led to unsatisfactory performance, where the policy struggles with unseen states and tasks. How can we break through the performance plateau of these models and elevate their capabilities to new heights? In this paper, we propose FLaRe, a large-scale RL fine-tuning framework that integrates robust pre-trained representations, large-scale training, and gradient stabilization techniques. Our method aligns pre-trained policies towards task completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both previously demonstrated and entirely novel tasks and embodiments. Specifically, on a set of long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, FLaRe achieves an average success rate of 79.5%, with absolute improvements of +23.6% in simulation and +30.7% in real-world settings over prior state-of-the-art methods. By utilizing only sparse rewards, our approach can enable generalizing to new capabilities beyond the pretraining data with minimal human effort. Moreover, we demonstrate rapid adaptation to new embodiments and behaviors with less than a day of fine-tuning. Code and website at https://robot-flare.github.io/.

### [Suite-IN: Aggregating Motion Features from Apple Suite for Robust Inertial Navigation]()

With the rapid development of wearable technology, devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones equipped with IMUs have become essential for applications such as pedestrian positioning. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) methods struggle with diverse motion patterns, while recent data-driven approaches, though improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to reliance on a single device. In our work, we attempt to enhance the positioning performance using the low-cost commodity IMUs embedded in the wearable devices. We propose a multi-device deep learning framework named Suite-IN, aggregating motion data from Apple Suite for inertial navigation. Motion data captured by sensors on different body parts contains both local and global motion information, making it essential to reduce the negative effects of localized movements and extract global motion representations from multiple devices.Our model innovatively introduces a contrastive learning module to disentangle motion-shared and motion-private latent representations, enhancing positioning accuracy. We validate our method on a self-collected dataset consisting of Apple Suite: iPhone, Apple Watch and Airpods, which supports a variety of movement patterns and flexible device configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models while maintaining robustness across diverse sensor configurations.

### [Sample-Efficient Unsupervised Policy Cloning from Ensemble Self-Supervised Labeled Videos]()

Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, action-labeled expert trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet videos, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from action-free videos without rewards and any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both action-free videos and reward-free interactions for robust dynamics understanding and advanced action prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient, unsupervised, and iterative training process, UPESV obtains an advanced policy based on a robust video labeling model. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art interaction-limited policy learning performance (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except for videos.

### [PrivilegedDreamer: Explicit Imagination of Privileged Information for Rapid Adaptation of Learned Policies]()

Numerous real-world control problems involve dynamics and objectives affected by unobservable hidden parameters, ranging from autonomous driving to robotic manipulation, which cause performance degradation during sim-to-real transfer. To represent these kinds of domains, we adopt hidden-parameter Markov decision processes (HIP-MDPs), which model sequential decision problems where hidden variables parameterize transition and reward functions. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, and meta-learning, simply treat the effect of hidden parameters as additional variance and often struggle to effectively handle HIP-MDP problems, especially when the rewards are parameterized by hidden variables. We introduce PrivilegedDreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that extends the existing model-based approach by incorporating an explicit parameter estimation module. PrivilegedDreamer features its novel dual recurrent architecture that explicitly estimates hidden parameters from limited historical data and enables us to condition the model, actor, and critic networks on these estimated parameters. Our empirical analysis on five diverse HIP-MDP tasks demonstrates that PrivilegedDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art model-based, model-free, and domain adaptation learning algorithms. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to justify the inclusion of each component in the proposed architecture.

### [Dynamic Non-Prehensile Object Transport Via Model-Predictive Reinforcement Learning]()

We investigate the problem of teaching a robot manipulator to perform dynamic non-prehensile object transport, also known as the ‘robot waiter’ task, from a limited set of real-world demonstrations. We propose an approach that combines batch reinforcement learning (RL) with model-predictive control (MPC) by pretraining an ensemble of value functions from demonstration data, and utilizing them online within an uncertainty-aware MPC scheme to ensure robustness to limited data coverage. Our approach is straightforward to integrate with off-the-shelf MPC frameworks and enables learning solely from task space demonstrations with sparsely labeled transitions, while leveraging MPC to ensure smooth joint space motions and constraint satisfaction. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments on a Franka Panda robot performing the robot waiter task and demonstrate robust deployment of value functions learned from 50-100 demonstrations. Furthermore, our approach enables generalization to novel objects not seen during training and can improve upon suboptimal demonstrations. We believe that such a framework can reduce the burden of providing extensive demonstrations and facilitate rapid training of robot manipulators to perform non-prehensile manipulation tasks.

### [Feature Extractor or Decision Maker: Rethinking the Role of Visual Encoders in Visuomotor Policies]()

An end-to-end (E2E) visuomotor policy is typically treated as a unified whole, but recent approaches using out-of-domain (OOD) data to pretrain the visual encoder have cleanly separated the visual encoder from the network, with the remainder referred to as the policy. We propose Visual Alignment Testing, an experimental framework designed to evaluate the validity of this functional separation. Our results indicate that in E2E-trained models, visual encoders actively contribute to decision-making resulting from motor data supervision, contradicting the assumed functional separation. In contrast, OOD-pretrained models, where encoders lack this capability, experience an average performance drop of 42% in our benchmark results, compared to the state-of-the-art performance achieved by E2E policies. We believe this initial exploration of visual encoders' role can provide a first step towards guiding future pretraining methods to address their decision-making ability, such as developing task-conditioned or context-aware encoders.

### [JRN-Geo: A Joint Perception Network Based on RGB and Normal Images for Cross-View Geo-Localization]()

Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images. Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network’s ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method against complex viewpoint variations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [U^2Frame: A Unified and Unsupervised Learning Framework for LiDAR-Based Loop Closing]()

Loop closing is critically important in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) due to its ability to correct accumulated localization errors. However, existing methods are hindered by the difficulty of acquiring pose labels and the unreliability of ground truth data. In this paper, we propose U^2Frame, a unified and unsupervised learning framework for LiDAR-based loop closing. Specifically, the natural temporal-spatial correlation in point cloud sequences is first leveraged to supervise the network training, where near scans are treated as positives and vice versa as negatives. A new neural architecture is then constructed to jointly learn highly discriminative local and global features for loop closure detection. Additionally, an effective candidate verification module that exploits high-order geometric information is presented to further filter out false loop closures and estimate precise poses. We extensively evaluate U^2Frame on multiple datasets according to two tasks derived from loop closing: place recognition and loop pose estimation. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art supervised techniques and has a strong generalization ability across unseen scenarios. Code will be released soon.

### [Self-Supervised Place Recognition by Refining Temporal and Featural Pseudo Labels from Panoramic Data]()

Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation’s spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR. Our code and datasets can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/TF-VPR/.

### [AiSDF: Structure-Aware Neural Signed Distance Fields in Indoor Scenes]()

Indoor scenes we are living in are visually homogenous or textureless, while they inherently have structural forms and provide enough structural priors for 3D scene reconstruction. Motivated by this fact, we propose a structure-aware online signed distance fields (SDF) reconstruction framework in indoor scenes, especially under the Atlanta world (AW) assumption. Thus, we dub this incremental SDF reconstruction for AW as AiSDF. Within the online framework, we infer the underlying Atlanta structure of a given scene and then estimate planar surfel regions supporting the Atlanta structure. This Atlanta-aware surfel representation provides an explicit planar map for a given scene. In addition, based on these Atlanta planar surfel regions, we adaptively sample and constrain the structural regularity in the SDF reconstruction, which enables us to improve the reconstruction quality by maintaining a high-level structure while enhancing the details of a given scene. We evaluate the proposed AiSDF on the ScanNet and ReplicaCAD datasets, where we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of reconstructing fine details of objects implicitly, as well as structures explicitly in room-scale scenes.

### [Targeted Hard Sample Synthesis Based on Estimated Pose and Occlusion Error for Improved Object Pose Estimation]()

6D Object pose estimation is a fundamental component in robotics enabling efficient interaction with the environment. It is particularly challenging in bin-picking applications, where objects may be in difficult poses, and occlusion between objects of the same type can cause confusion even in well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis that is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modelling of pose error in both the camera-to-object views-phere and occlusion space. Through evaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object poses and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic training samples to specifically target these regions. We demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20% across several ROBI-dataset objects and also state-of-the-art pose estimation models.

### [Configurable Embodied Data Generation for Class-Agnostic RGB-D Video Segmentation]()

This paper presents a method for generating large-scale datasets to improve class-agnostic video segmentation across robots with different form factors. Specifically, we consider the question of whether video segmentation models trained on generic segmentation data could be more effective for particular robot platforms if robot embodiment is factored into the data generation process. To answer this question, a pipeline is formulated for using 3D reconstructions (e.g. from HM3DSem[1]) to generate segmented videos that are configurable based on a robot’s embodiment (e.g. sensor type, sensor placement, and illumination source). A resulting massive RGB-D video panoptic segmentation dataset (MVPd) is introduced for extensive benchmarking with foundation and video segmentation models, as well as to support embodiment-focused research in video segmentation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that using MVPd for finetuning can lead to performance improvements when transferring foundation models to certain robot embodiments, such as specific camera placements. These experiments also show that using 3D modalities (depth images and camera pose) can lead to improvements in video segmentation accuracy and consistency.

### [Characterizing and Optimizing the Tail Latency for Autonomous Vehicle Systems]()

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) systems are envisioned to revolutionize our life by providing safe, relaxing, and convenient ground transportation. To ensure safety, AV systems need to make timely driving decisions in response to complicated and highly dynamic real-world driving environments. We present a systematic study to understand the causes of tail latency in AV systems and their impact on safety. We empirically analyze the design of two open-source industrial AV systems, Baidu Apollo and Autoware. We explore how pipelined computation design (such as module dependency and execution patterns), traffic factors (surrounding environments of AV), and system factors (such as cache contention) impact AV systems' tail latency. Inspired by the insights, We propose a set of systematic designs that lead to performance and safety improvements of up to 1.65× and 14×, respectively.

### [MORDA: A Synthetic Dataset to Facilitate Adaptation of Object Detectors to Unseen Real-Target Domain While Preserving Performance on Real-Source Domain]()

Deep neural network (DNN) based perception models are indispensable in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, their reliance on large-scale, high-quality data is broadly recognized as a burdensome necessity due to the substantial cost of data acquisition and labeling. Further, the issue is not a one-time concern as AVs might need a new dataset if they are to be deployed to another region (real-target domain) that the in-hand dataset within the real-source domain cannot incorporate. To mitigate this burden, we propose leveraging synthetic environments as an auxiliary domain where the characteristics of real domains are reproduced. This approach could enable indirect experience about the real-target domain in a time- and cost-effective manner. As a practical demonstration of our methodology, nuScenes and South Korea are employed to represent real-source and real-target domains, respectively. That means we construct digital twins for several regions of South Korea, and the data-acquisition framework of nuScenes is reproduced. Blending the aforementioned components within a simulator allows us to obtain a synthetic-fusion domain in which we forge our novel driving dataset, MORDA: Mixture Of Real-domain characteristics for synthetic-data-assisted Domain Adaptation. To verify the value of synthetic features that MORDA provides in learning about driving environments of South Korea, 2D/3D detectors are trained solely on a combination of nuScenes and MORDA. Afterward, their performance is evaluated on the unforeseen real-world dataset(AI-Hub) collected in South Korea. Our experiments present that MORDA can significantly improve mean Average Precision (mAP) on AI-Hub dataset while that on nuScenes is retained or slightly enhanced. Details on MORDA can be accessed at https://morda-e8d07e.gitlab.io.

### [Towards Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception for Autonomous Driving]()

Although existing 3D perception algorithms have demonstrated significant improvements in performance, their deployment on edge devices continues to encounter critical challenges due to substantial runtime latency. We propose a new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency. Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP) framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1) latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical data regardless of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a mechanism that compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online performance that closely aligns with 80% of its offline evaluation on the Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.

### [DRIVE: Dependable Robust Interpretable Visionary Ensemble Framework in Autonomous Driving]()

Recent advancements in autonomous driving have seen a paradigm shift towards end-to-end learning paradigms, which map sensory inputs directly to driving actions, thereby enhancing the robustness and adaptability of autonomous vehicles. However, these models often sacrifice interpretability, posing significant challenges to trust, safety, and regulatory compliance. To address these issues, we introduce DRIVE -- Dependable Robust Interpretable Visionary Ensemble Framework in Autonomous Driving, a comprehensive framework designed to improve the dependability and stability of explanations in end-to-end unsupervised autonomous driving models. Our work specifically targets the inherent instability problems observed in the Driving through the Concept Gridlock (DCG) model, which undermine the trustworthiness of its explanations and decision-making processes. We define four key attributes of textbf{DRIVE}: consistent interpretability, stable interpretability, consistent output, and stable output. These attributes collectively ensure that explanations remain reliable and robust across different scenarios and perturbations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the stability and dependability of explanations, thereby addressing the limitations of current models. Our contributions include an in-depth analysis of the dependability issues within the DCG model, a rigorous definition of DRIVE with its fundamental properties, a framework to implement DRIVE, and novel metrics for evaluating the dependability of concept-based explainable autonomous driving models. These advancements lay the groundwork for the development of more reliable and trusted autonomous driving systems, paving the way for their broader acceptance and deployment in real-world applicatio

### [Dur360BEV: A Real-World 360-Degree Single Camera Dataset and Benchmark for Bird-Eye View Mapping in Autonomous Driving]()

We present Dur360BEV, a novel spherical camera autonomous driving dataset equipped with a high-resolution 128-channel 3D LiDAR and a RTK-refined GNSS/INS system, along with a benchmark architecture designed to generate Bird-Eye-View (BEV) maps using only a single spherical camera. This dataset and benchmark address the challenges of BEV generation in autonomous driving, particularly by reducing hardware complexity through the use of a single 360-degree camera instead of multiple perspective cameras. Within our benchmark architecture, we propose a novel spherical-image-to-BEV module that leverages spherical imagery and a refined sampling strategy to project features from 2D to 3D. Our approach also includes an innovative application of focal loss, specifically adapted to address the extreme class imbalance often encountered in BEV segmentation tasks, that demonstrates improved segmentation performance on the Dur360BEV dataset. The results show that our benchmark not only simplifies the sensor setup but also achieves competitive performance. Code + Dataset: https://github.com/Tom-E-Durham/Dur360BEV

### [MVCTrack: Boosting 3D Point Cloud Tracking Via Multimodal-Guided Virtual Cues]()

3D single object tracking plays a crucial role in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multimodal-guided virtual cue projection (MVCP) scheme to generate virtual cues for sparse point cloud. Furthermore, we also construct a enhanced tracker called MVCTrack based the generated virtual cues.Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to generate dense 3D virtual points that enhance the originally sparse 3D point cloud. These virtual points can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D detectors, resulting in significant performance improvements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/StiphyJay/MVCTrack

### [Chameleon: Fast-Slow Neuro-Symbolic Lane Topology Extraction]()

Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and determining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous driving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by visionlanguage foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chainof-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-v2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/XR-Lee/neural-symbolic.

### [ERetinex: Event Camera Meets Retinex Theory for Low-Light Image Enhancement]()

Low-light image enhancement aims to restore the under-exposure image captured in dark scenarios. Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras’ high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by 84.28%. The code is available at https://github.com/lodew920/ERetinex.

### [ThermoStereoRT: Thermal Stereo Matching in Real Time Via Knowledge Distillation and Attention-Based Refinement]()

We introduce ThermoStereoRT, a real-time thermal stereo matching method designed for all-weather conditions that recovers disparity from two rectified thermal stereo images, envisioning applications such as night-time drone surveillance or under-bed cleaning robots. Leveraging a lightweight yet powerful backbone, ThermoStereoRT constructs a 3D cost volume from thermal images and employs multi-scale attention mechanisms to produce an initial disparity map. To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial attention module. Addressing the challenge of sparse ground truth data in thermal imagery, we utilize knowledge distillation to boost performance without increasing computational demands. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that ThermoStereoRT delivers both real-time capacity and robust accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world deployment in various challenging environments.Our code will be released on https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS-team/ThermoStereoRT.

### [Tool-Mediated Robot Perception of Granular Substances Using Multiple Sensory Modalities]()

People use tools to interact with and perceive the world, with multimodal sensory inputs forming the basis of how we understand our environment. For example, a blind person uses a walking cane to tap the road and detect obstacles, and a builder uses a hammer to strike a wall to assess its structural integrity. Using tools extends our sensory capabilities during exploratory behaviors, enabling us to perceive object properties that are otherwise inaccessible. Inspired by this cognitive process, we propose a framework in which a multi-sensory robot employs exploratory behaviors using various tools to recognize granular substances. Our framework effectively integrates multiple non-visual sensory inputs (e.g., audio, haptic, and tactile) gathered through multiple tools (e.g., spoon, fork) and behaviors (e.g., stirring, poking) to perceive object properties. The framework segments interactions into time windows and aligns different modalities, enhancing data efficiency and interactive perception. Additionally, we conducted tool-transfer experiments to evaluate similarities between tools. Our experiments demonstrate that combining multiple tools and behaviors outperforms single-tool and single-behavior approaches. While the audio modality dominates the non-visual multimodal system, other modalities contribute. We further demonstrate that tool similarities vary depending on the behavior, and notably, the robot does not need to complete entire interactions to achieve optimal recognition accuracy.

### [FisheyeDepth: A Real Scale Self-Supervised Depth Estimation Model for Fisheye Camera]()

Accurate depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene comprehension in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Fisheye cameras, known for their wide field of view, have inherent geometric benefits. However, their use in depth estimation is restricted by a scarcity of ground truth data and image distortions. We present FisheyeDepth, a self-supervised depth estimation model tailored for fisheye cameras. We incorporate a fisheye camera model into the projection and reprojection stages during training to handle image distortions, thereby improving depth estimation accuracy and training stability. Furthermore, we incorporate real-scale pose information into the geometric projection between consecutive frames, replacing the poses estimated by the conventional pose network. Essentially, this method offers the necessary physical depth for robotic tasks, and also streamlines the training and inference procedures. Additionally, we devise a multi-channel output strategy to improve robustness by adaptively fusing features at various scales, which reduces the noise from real pose data. We demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our model in fisheye image depth estimation through evaluations on public datasets and real-world scenarios. The project website is available at: https://github.com/guoyangzhao/FisheyeDepth.

### [Geometry-Aware Volumetric Data Stitching Using Local Surface Mapping and Robot Optical Coherence Tomography]()

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been widely used for high-fidelity biological tissue scanning but is traditionally limited to small lateral fields of view that preclude large-area scanning. To overcome this problem, we propose an integration of an OCT sensor to a 6-DOF robot arm end-effector combined with a geometry-aware stitching model for surface and volumetric data stitching. We firstly develop a simple but efficient Robot-OCT calibration method by using a three-marker calibration pattern and implement an optimization solver. Given a pre-defined trajectory, a local planner is developed to update the sensor pose by using the OCT point cloud information in order to maintain the effective imaging depth based on the distance and orientation constraints. The system calibration method is verified through repeated experiments with the three-marker targets and the result shows an average testing error of 0.132 +-0.071 mm. The geometry-aware OCT stitching framework is demonstrated based on the experiments of different scanning trajectories and 3D-printed phantoms for large-area scanning. The OCT stitched point cloud is compared with the ground truth from the phantom CAD model and the result show an average surface alignment error of 0.441 +- 0.241 mm for the path following tasks.

### [Thermal Chameleon: Task-Adaptive Tone-Mapping for Radiometric Thermal-Infrared Images]()

Thermal Infrared (TIR) imaging provides robust perception for navigating in challenging outdoor environments but faces issues with poor texture and low image contrast due to its 14/16-bit format. Conventional methods utilize various tone-mapping methods to enhance contrast and photometric consistency of TIR images, however, the choice of tone-mapping is largely dependent on knowing the task and temperature dependent priors to work well. In this paper, we present the Thermal Chameleon Network (TCNet), a task-adaptive tone-mapping approach for RAW 14-bit TIR images. Given the same image, TCNet tone-maps different representations of TIR images tailored for each specific task, eliminating the heuristic image rescaling preprocessing and reliance on the extensive prior knowledge of the scene temperature or task-specific characteristics. TCNet exhibits improved generalization performance across object detection and monocular depth estimation, with minimal computational overhead and modular integration to existing architectures for various tasks.

### [MAC-VO: Metrics-Aware Covariance for Learning-Based Stereo Visual Odometry]()

We propose the MAC-VO, a novel learning-based stereo VO that leverages the learned metrics-aware matching uncertainty for dual purposes: selecting keypoint and weighing the residual in pose graph optimization. Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.

### [Ground-Optimized 4D Radar-Inertial Odometry Via Continuous Velocity Integration Using Gaussian Process]()

Radar ensures robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions, yet challenges remain due to its high inherent noise level. Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements. Our approach demonstrates remarkable performance (less than 1% vertical drift) in public datasets with meticulous conditions, illustrating substantial improvement in elevation accuracy. The code will be released as open source for the community: https://github.com/wooseongY/Go-RIO.

### [UAD: Unsupervised Affordance Distillation for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation]()

Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods on visual affordance predictions often rely on manually-annotated data or conditions only on predefined set of tasks. We introduce Unsupervised Affordance Distillation (UAD), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes as well as to various human activities despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

### [Bat-VUFN: Bat-Inspired Visual-And-Ultrasound Fusion Network for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions]()

Environmental factors like weather and road conditions significantly impact object recognition in autonomous vehicles. While cameras provide rich semantic information, their reliance on electromagnetic waves makes them vulnerable to performance degradation in adverse conditions such as low light and rain. In contrast, ultrasonic sensors offer reliable short-range detection, unaffected by such conditions. We introduce Bat-VUFN, a bio-inspired multi-sensory system that merges camera and ultrasonic data using an Input Quality Score (IQS)-based fusion technique to enhance near-field perception in challenging environments. Bat-VUFN dynamically adjusts sensor contributions based on prevailing conditions, achieving impressive results on the K-Bat dataset (average precision: 0.95, MAE: 0.52m, RMSE: 0.55m), demonstrating its robustness in adverse scenarios.

### [TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-Efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-Scale Robots]()

In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering---the first level of ``sensor autonomy''---is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.

### [TSCLIP: Robust CLIP Fine-Tuning for Worldwide Cross-Regional Traffic Sign Recognition]()

Traffic sign is a critical map feature for navigation and traffic control. Nevertheless, current methods for traffic sign recognition rely on traditional deep learning models, which typically suffer from significant performance degradation considering the variations in data distribution across different regions. In this paper, we propose TSCLIP, a robust fine-tuning approach with the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for worldwide cross-regional traffic sign recognition. We first curate a cross-regional traffic sign benchmark dataset by combining data from ten different sources. Then, we propose a prompt engineering scheme tailored to the characteristics of traffic signs, which involves specific scene descriptions and corresponding rules to generate targeted text descriptions for optimizing the model training process. During the TSCLIP fine-tuning process, we implement adaptive dynamic weight ensembling (ADWE) to seamlessly incorporate outcomes from each training iteration with the zero-shot CLIP model. This approach ensures that the model retains its ability to generalize while acquiring new knowledge about traffic signs. Our method surpasses conventional classification benchmark models in cross-regional traffic sign evaluations, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing CLIP fine-tuning techniques (Fig. 1). To the best knowledge of authors, TSCLIP is the first contrastive language-image model used for the worldwide cross-regional traffic sign recognition task. The project website is available at: https://github.com/guoyangzhao/TSCLIP.

### [Adaptive Abrupt Disturbance Rejection Tracking Control for Wheeled Mobile Robots]()

Uncertain disturbances increase the difficulty of robust tracking control for wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in industrial scenarios, especially when exhibiting abrupt changes. This letter proposes an adaptive abrupt disturbance-rejection sliding mode controller (SMC). To address the increased variability in the disturbance boundaries caused by abrupt transitions, a new adaptive disturbance observer (ADOB) is designed to improve the tracking robustness and weaken the chattering of SMC by generating auxiliary system variables without depending on any prior boundary information about disturbance and its change rate. Then, a novel barrier function (BF)-based switching law is constructed to suppress the residual-disturbance estimation error of the ADOB at the transient state, which achieves the tradeoffs between the necessary sufficient gain and chattering by avoiding gain overestimation. The finite-time Lyapunov stability of the sliding variables and the estimated errors have been proved theoretically. The practical effectiveness is illustrated in experiments with the custom-developed WMRs.

### [OPPA: Online Planner's Parameter Adaptation for Enhanced Mobile Robot Navigation]()

Autonomous navigation in mobile robots has made significant advancements; however, traditional methods often struggle to adapt in real-time to dynamic or unstructured environments. This paper presents the Online Planner’s Parameter Adaptation (OPPA) framework, which enhances both adaptability and safety in mobile robot navigation by dynamically adjusting planner parameters. OPPA integrates a rule-based system for estimating tunnel width using 2D LiDAR and path data with a learning-based approach utilizing a shallow transformer model. By incorporating a human-in-the-loop process to refine training data, OPPA improves accuracy and reliability in complex environments. Designed for real-time efficiency on resource-constrained platforms, OPPA has been validated through simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to enhance both safety and performance. These results highlight OPPA as a viable solution for dynamic and complex robotic applications.

### [Learning to Refine Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions Via Uncertainty-Aware Online Parameter Adaptation]()

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring safety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-Rényi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of ICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing performance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both fixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios across safety and performance metrics.

### [GA-TEB: Goal-Adaptive Framework for Efficient Navigation Based on Goal Lines]()

In crowd navigation, the local goal plays a crucial role in trajectory initialization, optimization, and evaluation. Recognizing that when the global goal is distant, the robot's primary objective is avoiding collisions, making it less critical to pass through the exact local goal point, this work introduces the concept of goal lines, which extend the traditional local goal from a single point to multiple candidate lines. Coupled with a topological map construction strategy that groups obstacles to be as convex as possible, a goal-adaptive navigation framework is proposed to efficiently plan multiple candidate trajectories. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed GA-TEB framework effectively prevents deadlock situations, where the robot becomes frozen due to a lack of feasible trajectories in crowded environments. Additionally, the framework greatly increases planning frequency in scenarios with numerous non-convex obstacles, enhancing both robustness and safety.

### [Integrating One-Shot View Planning with a Single Next-Best View Via Long-Tail Multiview Sampling]()

Existing view planning systems either adopt an iterative paradigm using next-best views (NBV) or a one-shot pipeline relying on the set-covering view-planning (SCVP) network. However, neither of these methods can concurrently guarantee both high-quality and high-efficiency reconstruction of 3D unknown objects. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a crucial hypothesis: with the availability of more information about the unknown object, the prediction quality of the SCVP network improves. There are two ways to provide extra information: (1) leveraging perception data obtained from NBVs, and (2) training on an expanded dataset of multiview inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel combined pipeline that incorporates a single NBV before activating the proposed multiview-activated (MA-)SCVP network. The MA-SCVP is trained on a multiview dataset generated by our long-tail sampling method, which addresses the issue of unbalanced multiview inputs and enhances the network performance. Extensive simulated experiments substantiate that our system demonstrates a significant surface coverage increase and a substantial 45% reduction in movement cost compared to state-of-the-art systems. Real-world experiments justify the capability of our system for generalization and deployment.

### [Decomposition-Based Hierarchical Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications]()

Past research into robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, notably Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), was largely based on single formulas for individual or groups of robots. But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is utilized to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks.	 Our approach was experimentally applied to domains of robotic navigation and manipulation. The simulation demonstrated that our approach can find better solutions using less runtimes.

### [Hand It to Me Formally! Data-Driven Control for Human-Robot Handovers with Signal Temporal Logic]()

To facilitate human-robot interaction (HRI), we aim for robot behavior that is efficient, transparent, and closely resembles human actions. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formal language that enables the specification and verification of complex temporal properties in robotic systems, helping to ensure their correctness. STL can be used to generate explainable robot behaviour, the degree of satisfaction of which can be quantified by checking its STL robustness. In this work, we use data-driven STL inference techniques to model human behavior in human-human interactions, on a handover dataset. We then use the learned model to generate robot behavior in human-robot interactions. We present a handover planner based on inferred STL specifications to command robotic motion in human-robot handovers. We also validate our method in a human-to-robot handover experiment.

### [Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-Critical Control]()

Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.

### [Scalable Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Coordination under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications]()

Motion planning with simple objectives, such as collision-avoidance and goal-reaching, can be solved efficiently using modern planners. However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.

### [Planning with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications: Handling Quantifiable and Unquantifiable Uncertainty]()

This work studies the planning problem for robotic systems under both quantifiable and unquantifiable uncertainty. The objective is to enable the robotic systems to optimally fulfill high-level tasks specified by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. To capture both types of uncertainty in a unified modelling framework, we utilise Markov Decision Processes with Set-valued Transitions (MDPSTs). We introduce a novel solution technique for optimal robust strategy synthesis of MDPSTs with LTL specifications. To improve efficiency, our work leverages limit-deterministic B"uchi automata (LDBAs) as the automaton representation for LTL to take advantage of their efficient constructions. To tackle the inherent nondeterminism in MDPSTs, which presents a significant challenge for reducing the LTL planning problem to a reachability problem, we introduce the concept of a Winning Region (WR) for MDPSTs. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for computing the WR over the product of the MDPST and the LDBA. Finally, a robust value iteration algorithm is invoked to solve the reachability problem. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study involving a mobile robot operating in the hexagonal world, demonstrating promising efficiency gains.

### [Lyapunov-Certified Trajectory Tracking for Mobile Robot with a Tail Wheel: Differential-Flatness and Adaptive Backstepping Design]()

This paper proposes a trajectory tracking control law for a mobile robot with two front differential wheels and a tail wheel. The dynamics is given by mimicking Ackerman steering model for the dynamics of position and orientation, associated with the actuator dynamics of the tail wheel's angle modeled by a first-order response with respect to the robot's angular velocity. First we develop a nominal trajectory tracking control law to track a given desired trajectory by applying differential-flatness property of the unicycle model and backstepping approach to handle the actuator dynamics. The effectiveness of the trajectory tracking is demonstrated by conducting hardware robot experiment after performing system identification, which illustrates the superior performance over a benchmark method. The design is also extended to an adaptive tracking control under parameter uncertainty in the tail wheel dynamics through introducing the adaptation law of the parameters, and the performance is demonstrated in numerical simulation.

### [OPRNet: Object-Centric Point Reconstruction Network for Multimodal 3D Object Detection in Adverse Weathers]()

The development of a multimodal fusion technique utilizing LiDAR-camera data has enabled precise 3D object detection for self-driving vehicles, particularly in ideal conditions with clear weather. Nevertheless, adverse weathers such as fog, snow, and rain remain a challenge for existing multimodal methods. These conditions lead to a reduced density of point clouds as a result of laser signal occlusion and attenuation. Additionally, as the distance grows, the point cloud becomes sparser, further challenging object detection tasks. To address these problems, we introduce a point reconstruction network employing equirectangular projection tailored for multimodal 3D object detection. This network incorporates a range-constrained noise filter to remove noise caused by adverse weather and an object-centric point generator designed to flexibly generate points for distant objects. Moreover, we propose a dual 2D auxiliary module to enhance image features and support the point reconstruction. Experimental evaluations conducted on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that the suggested approach surpasses current techniques. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/jhyoon964/oprnet.

### [Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Fusion for Event-Visible Object Detection]()

Traditional visible light cameras are prone to performance degradation under varying weather and lighting conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce an event-based camera and propose a novel hierarchical spatiotemporal fusion approach for event-visible object detection. Our method enhances detection performance by integrating data from both event-based and visible light cameras. We have designed three key modules: The Gated Event Accumulation Representation module (GEAR), the Temporal Feature Selection module (TFS), and the Adaptive Fusion module (AF). GEAR and TFS enhance temporal feature fusion at both image and feature levels, while AF effectively integrates multi-modal features with low computational complexity. Our approach has been trained and validated on the publicly available DSEC-Detection dataset, achieving mAP50 and mAP50-95 scores of 67.2% and 45.6%, respectively, demonstrating superior detection performance and validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Dark-DENet: A Lightweight Enhancement Network for Low-Light Object Detection]()

Deep learning-based object detection methods have shown significant success, particularly in robotic vision tasks like autonomous navigation and object manipulation. However, their performance drops sharply in low-light con- ditions, challenging robots in poorly lit environments. To address this, we propose Dark-DENet, a lightweight detection- driven enhancement network specifically designed for low- light conditions. Dark-DENet introduces an Improved Global Enhancement Module for low-frequency components to capture multiscale features, and a multi-layer convolutional structure in the Detail Enhancement Module to enhance high-frequency components. Additionally, the Scale-Aware Pooling Fusion Module enriches the semantic information of HF components. Dark-DENet is a plug-and-play network that can be easily integrated into the backbone of various detectors for joint training. Integrated with YOLOv5 as DD-YOLO, and combined with other models like YOLO series, RT-DETR, RetinaNet, and Faster R-CNN, experimental results show Dark-DENet consistently improves detection performance across all models. It effectively enhances latent features under limited runtime, making it a robust solution for robotic vision in low-light environments.

### [CubeDN: Real-Time Drone Detection in 3D Space from Dual mmWave Radar Cubes]()

As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects, localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall 95% average precision (AP) and 85% average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

### [CA-IoU: Central-Gaussian Angle-IoU for Robust Bounding Box Regression]()

Accurate object detection depends on the precise refinement of bounding box regression. Recent advancements in bounding box regression have introduced a variety of methodologies aimed at reducing the disparity between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. The prevailing objective functions for bounding box regression typically encompass three key perspectives: 1) Intersection over Union (IoU), 2) distance between central points, and 3) aspect ratio alignment. Nonetheless, these existing loss functions encounter two primary challenges including slow convergence of the distance term and aspect ratio variation irrelevant to bounding box localization. This paper presents two novel loss terms to address these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the concept of the Integral of Central-Gaussian, a novel approach that leverages the cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from a closed-form Gaussian distribution based on the central points of bounding boxes. Secondly, we introduce an alternative aspect ratio representation by minimizing the angle between two bounding boxes in direct proportion to their IoU. We term this comprehensive loss function ``Central-Gaussian Angle-IoU" (CA-IoU), seamlessly incorporating the Integral of Central-Gaussian with angle-based IoU. Extensive experiments on various models and benchmarks for object detection highlight the superior performance of CA-IoU loss compared to existing bounding box regression methods. The source code and the corresponding trained models will be made available.

### [On Onboard LiDAR-Based Flying Object Detection]()

A new robust and accurate approach for the detection and localization of flying objects with the purpose of highly dynamic aerial interception and agile multi-robot interaction is presented in this paper. The approach is proposed for use on board of autonomous aerial vehicles equipped with a 3D LiDAR sensor. It relies on a novel 3D occupancy voxel mapping method for the target detection that provides high localization accuracy and robustness with respect to varying environments and appearance changes of the target. In combination with a proposed cluster-based multi-target tracker, sporadic false positives are suppressed, state estimation of the target is provided, and the detection latency is negligible. This makes the system suitable for tasks of agile multi-robot interaction, such as autonomous aerial interception or formation control where fast, precise, and robust relative localization of other robots is crucial. We evaluate the viability and performance of the system in simulated and real-world experiments which demonstrate that at a range of 20m, our system is capable of reliably detecting a micro-scale UAV with an almost 100% recall, 0.2m accuracy, and 20ms delay.

### [Improving Disturbance Estimation and Suppression Via Learning among Systems with Mismatched Dynamics]()

Iterative learning control (ILC) is a method for reducing system tracking or estimation errors over multiple iterations by using information from past iterations. The disturbance observer (DOB) is used to estimate and mitigate disturbances within the system, while the system is being affected by them. ILC enhances system performance by introducing a feedforward signal in each iteration. However, its effectiveness may diminish if the conditions change during the iterations. On the other hand, although DOB effectively mitigates the effects of new disturbances, it cannot entirely eliminate them as it operates reactively. Therefore, neither ILC nor DOB alone can ensure sufficient robustness in challenging scenarios. This study focuses on the simultaneous utilization of ILC and DOB to enhance system robustness. The proposed methodology specifically targets dynamically different linearized systems performing repetitive tasks. The systems share similar forms but differ in dynamics (e.g. sizes, masses, and controllers). Consequently, the design of learning filters must account for these differences in dynamics. To validate the approach, the study establishes a theoretical framework for designing learning filters in conjunction with DOB. The validity of the framework is then confirmed through numerical studies and experimental tests conducted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although UAVs are nonlinear systems, the study employs a linearized controller as they operate in proximity to the hover condition.

### [Learning Speed Adaptation for Flight in Clutter]()

Animals learn to adapt speed of their movements to their capabilities and the environment they observe. Mobile robots should also demonstrate this ability to trade-off aggressiveness and safety for efficiently accomplishing tasks. The aim of this work is to endow flight vehicles with the ability of speed adaptation in prior unknown and partially observable cluttered environments. We propose a hierarchical learning and planning system where we utilize both well-established methods of model-based trajectory generation and trial-and-error that comprehensively learns a policy to dynamically configure the speed constraint. Technically, we use online reinforcement learning to obtain the deployable policy. The statistical results in simulation demonstrate the advantages of our method over the constant speed constraint baselines and an alternative method in terms of flight efficiency and safety. In particular, the policy behaves perception awareness, which distinguish it from alternative approaches. By deploying the policy to hardware, we verify that these advantages can be brought to the real world.

### [Design, Contact Modeling, and Collision-Inclusive Planning of a Dual-Stiffness Aerial RoboT (DART)]()

Collision-resilient quadrotors have gained significant attention for operating in cluttered environments and leveraging impacts to perform agile maneuvers. However, existing designs are typically single-mode: either safeguarded by propeller guards that prevent deformation or deformable but lacking rigidity, which is crucial for stable flight in open environments. This paper introduces DART, a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT, that adapts its post-collision response by either engaging a locking mechanism for a rigid mode or disengaging it for a flexible mode, respectively. Comprehensive characterization tests highlight the significant difference in post-collision responses between its rigid and flexible modes, with the rigid mode offering seven times higher stiffness compared to the flexible mode. To understand and harness the collision dynamics, we propose a novel collision response prediction model based on the linear complementarity system theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of predicting collision forces for both the rigid and flexible modes of DART. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the model and underscore its potential to advance collision-inclusive trajectory planning in aerial robotics.

### [Learning Quadrotor Control from Visual Features Using Differentiable Simulation]()

The sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant challenge in robotics. RL requires large-scale simulation and can still cause long training times, slowing research and innovation. This issue is particularly pronounced in vision-based control tasks where reliable state estimates are not accessible. Differentiable simulation offers an alternative by enabling gradient back-propagation through the dynamics model, providing low-variance analytical policy gradients and, hence, higher sample efficiency. However, its usage for real-world robotic tasks has yet been limited. This work demonstrates the great potential of differentiable simulation for learning quadrotor control. We show that training in differentiable simulation significantly outperforms model-free RL in terms of both sample efficiency and training time, allowing a policy to learn to recover a quadrotor in seconds when providing vehicle states and in minutes when relying solely on visual features. The key to our success is two-fold. First, the use of a simple surrogate model for gradient computation greatly accelerates training without sacrificing control performance. Second, combining state representation learning with policy learning enhances convergence speed in tasks where only visual features are observable. These findings highlight the potential of differentiable simulation for real-world robotics and offer a compelling alternative to conventional RL approaches.

### [Real-Time Planning of Minimum-Time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight]()

We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.

### [Variable Time-Step MPC for Agile Multi-Rotor UAV Interception of Dynamic Targets]()

Agile trajectory planning can improve the efficiency of multi-rotor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in scenarios with combined task-oriented and kinematic trajectory planning, such as monitoring spatio-temporal phenomena or intercepting dynamic targets. Agile planning using existing non-linear model predictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it becomes increasingly computationally demanding. This reduces the prediction horizon length, which leads to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighbourhood. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by introducing variable time-steps and coupling them with the prediction horizon length. A simplified point-mass motion primitive is used to leverage the differential flatness of quadrotor dynamics and the generation of feasible trajectories in the flat output space. Based on evaluation results and experimentally validated deployment, the proposed method increases the solution quality by enabling planning for long flight segments but allowing tightly sampled maneuvering.

### [REMOTE: Real-Time Ego-Motion Tracking for Various Endoscopes Via Multimodal Visual Feature Learning]()

Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement. The project page is here: https://remote-bmxs.netlify.app.

### [Intraoperative Trocar-Based Eyeball Rotation Estimation Using Only 2D Microscope Images]()

In ophthalmic surgery, surgeons or robots manipulate a light probe and an instrument around two separated trocars following sclerotomy to achieve orbital control for eyeball pose adjustment and subsequent surgical tasks referring to microscope frames. However, current methods face significant challenges in directly extracting the eyeball pose from real-time microscope frames due to the limited microscope perspective and the darkened operating room (OR). This paper decomposes eyeball rotations only along the x and y axes. Then, a method of calculating eyeball poses using eyeball geometry and microscopic trocar positions is presented. This method is tested by simulation and a phantom system with current [-2.0, 2.8] degree error, providing assistant intraoperative eyeball status in the dark OR with extended method discussions.

### [Toward Zero-Shot Learning for Visual Dehazing of Urological Surgical Robots]()

Robot-assisted surgery has profoundly influenced current forms of minimally invasive surgery. However, in transurethral urological surgical robots, they need to work in a liquid environment. This causes vaporization of the liquid when shearing and heating is performed, resulting in bubble atomization that affects the visual perception of the robot. This can lead to the need for uninterrupted pauses in the surgical procedure, which makes the surgery take longer. To address the atomization characteristics of liquids under urological surgical robotic vision, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot dehaze method (RSF-Dehaze). Specifically, the proposed Region Similarity Filling Module (RSFM) of RSF-Dehaze significantly improves the recovery of blurred region tissues. In addition, we organize and propose a dehaze dataset for robotic vision in urological surgery (USRobot-Dehaze dataset). In particular, this dataset contains the three most common urological surgical robot operation scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to organize and propose a publicly available dehaze dataset for urological surgical robot vision. The proposed RSF-Dehaze proves the effectiveness of our method in three urological surgical robot operation scenarios with extensive comparative experiments with 20 most classical and advanced dehazing and image recovery algorithms. The proposed source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wurenkai/RSF-Dehaze .

### [Sim2Real within 5 Minutes: Efficient Domain Transfer with Stylized Gaussian Splatting for Endoscopic Images]()

Robot assisted endoluminal intervention is an emerging technique for both benign and malignant luminal lesions. With vision-based navigation, when combined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover position and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In practice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is complicated by significant texture differences. Although methods such as style transfer can be used to address this issue, they require large datasets from both source and target domains with prolonged training times. This paper proposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian splatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast training time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the first phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as differential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance related parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual content. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and depth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images. Detailed validation was performed to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method compared to that of the current state-of-the-art, highlighting the potential for intra-operative surgical navigation.

### [Advancing Dense Endoscopic Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting-Driven Surface Normal-Aware Tracking and Mapping]()

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for precise surgical interventions and robotic tasks in minimally invasive procedures. While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of 1.87±0.63 mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering. Our code will be released at github.com/lastbasket/Endo-2DTAM.

### [HFUS-NeRF: Hybrid Representation for Fast Ultrasound Reconstruction in Robotic Ultrasound System]()

Telemedicine is promising in digital healthcare management, such as supporting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound reconstruction and new view image synthesis, which can assist in diagnosis and reexamine, have significant potential in tele-ultrasound, especially integrating robotic ultrasound systems (RUSS). Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), an impressive reconstruction method, requires long training times, limiting its practicality in ultrasound. Despite NeRF variants achieving faster optimization, their performance remains confined to natural scene reconstructions. To address this limitation, we propose HFUS-NeRF, a hybrid representation method designed for fast and accurate ultrasound reconstruction. HFUS-NeRF integrates multi-resolution hash-grid and tri-plane representations to represent each sampling point of the ultrasonic wave. A unified model for sampling points from different ultrasonic probes is presented to simulate the wave's propagation through tissues, and the final ultrasound image is rendered using volume rendering. Compared with NeRF-based ultrasound reconstruction, both the hash grid and tri-plane resolutions can be scaled up more efficiently, improving reconstruction speed. Experimental results demonstrate that HFUS-NeRF enhances reconstruction quality while significantly reducing reconstruction time to mere minutes. Furthermore, we validated HFUS-NeRF’s adaptability by reconstruction using images from different types of ultrasound probes, and real-world experiments confirmed its feasibility and transferability, enabling fast ultrasound reconstruction on human subjects.

### [Mission-Oriented Gaussian Process Motion Planning for UUVs Over Complex Seafloor Terrain and Current Flows]()

We present a novel motion planning framework for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) - the first framework that applies Gaussian process motion planning to solve a 3D path planning problem for a 6-DoF robot in underwater environments. We address missions requiring UUVs to remain in close proximity to seafloor terrain, which must be achieved alongside collision avoidance. Our framework also considers the influence of current flows as part of the cost function, allowing for more accurate planning. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we compare it with the widely used RRT* and STOMP algorithms over a range of underwater environments. Our experimental results demonstrate the stability and time efficiency of our framework.

### [Word2Wave: Language Driven Mission Programming for Efficient Subsea Deployments of Marine Robots]()

This paper explores the design and development of a language-based interface for dynamic mission programming of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed "Word2Wave" (W2W) framework enables interactive programming and parameter configuration of AUVs for remote subsea missions. The W2W framework includes: (i) a set of novel language rules and command structures for efficient language-to-mission mapping; (ii) a GPT-based prompt engineering module for training data generation; (iii) a small language model (SLM)-based sequence-to-sequence learning pipeline for mission command generation from human speech or text; and (iv) a novel user interface for 2D mission map visualization and human-machine interfacing. The proposed learning pipeline adapts an SLM named T5-Small that can learn language-to-mission mapping from processed language data effectively, providing robust and efficient performance. In addition to a benchmark evaluation with state-of-the-art, we conduct a user interaction study to demonstrate the effectiveness of W2W over commercial AUV programming interfaces. Across participants, W2W-based programming required less than 10% time for mission programming compared to traditional interfaces; it is deemed to be a simpler and more natural paradigm for subsea mission programming with a usability score of 76.25. W2W opens up promising future research opportunities on hands-free AUV mission programming for efficient subsea deployments.

### [Three-Dimensional Obstacle Avoidance and Path Planning for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles Using Elastic Bands (I)]()

Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have become indispensable tools for inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR) operations in the underwater domain. The major focus and novelty of this work is collision-free autonomous navigation of UUVs in dynamically changing environments. Path planning and obstacle avoidance are fundamental concepts for enabling autonomy for mobile robots. This remains a challenge, particularly for underwater vehicles operating in complex and dynamically changing environments. The elastic band method has been a suggested method for planning collision-free paths and is based on modeling the path as a dynamic system that will continuously be reshaped based on its surroundings. This article proposes adaptations to the method for underwater applications and presents a thorough investigation of the method for 3-D path planning and obstacle avoidance, both through simulations and extensive lab and field experiments. In the experiments, the method was used by a UUV operating autonomously at an industrial-scale fish farm and demonstrated that the method was able to successfully guide the vehicle through a challenging and constantly changing environment. The proposed work has broad applications for field deployment of marine robots in environments that require the vehicle to quickly react to changes in its surroundings.

### [A Data-Driven Velocity Estimator for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Experiencing Unmeasurable Flow and Wave Disturbance]()

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) encounter significant challenges in confined spaces like ports and testing tanks, where vehicle-environment interactions, such as wave reflections and unsteady flows, introduce complex, time-varying disturbances. Model-based state estimation methods can struggle to handle these dynamics, leading to localization errors. To address this, we propose a data-driven velocity estimation approach using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network, capturing temporal dependencies and rejecting external disturbances. This velocity estimator is then integrated into a sensor fusion framework using an asynchronous Kalman filter to improve localization by fusing on-board and off-board sensor information. Experimental validation on miniature AUVs demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing accuracy for velocity and position estimation in environments with significant disturbances due to interactions between the vehicle and the environment.

### [Dynamic End Effector Trajectory Tracking for Small-Scale Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (UVMS): Modeling, Control, and Experimental Validation]()

With the ongoing miniaturization, recently, lightweight, commercial underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) have emerged that massively lower the entry barrier into underwater manipulation. Within this research field, dynamic and accurate end effector trajectory tracking is a crucial first step in developing autonomous capabilities. In this context, coupling effects between the manipulator and vehicle dynamics are expected to pose a considerable challenge. However, UVMS control strategies analyzed in detailed experimental studies are particularly rare. We present a holistic approach based on task-priority control that we describe and discuss from modeling towards extensive experimental studies, which are crucial for the notoriously hard-to-simulate underwater domain. We demonstrate this framework on the widely used platform of a BlueROV2 and an Alpha 5 manipulator. The end effector trajectory tracking is shown to be highly accurate, with < 4 cm median position error. Moreover, our experimental findings on the consideration of dynamic coupling within UVMS control motivate further research. The code is available at https://github.com/HippoCampusRobotics/uvms. A video of the results is available at https://youtu.be/IDMlI5KqlVI.

### [DeepVL: Dynamics and Inertial Measurements-Based Deep Velocity Learning for Underwater Odometry]()

This paper presents a learned model to predict the robot-centric velocity of an underwater robot through dynamics-aware proprioception. The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.

### [A Frequency-Based Attention Neural Network and Subject-Adaptive Transfer Learning for sEMG Hand Gesture Classification]()

This study introduces a novel approach for real-time hand gesture classification through the integration of a Frequency-based Attention Neural Network (FANN) with Subject-Adaptive Transfer Learning, specifically tailored for surface electromyography (sEMG) data. By utilizing the Fourier transform, the proposed methodology leverages the inherent frequency characteristics of sEMG signals to enhance the discriminative features for accurate gesture recognition. Additionally, the subject-adaptive transfer learning strategy is employed to improve model generalization across different individuals. The combination of these techniques results in an effective and versatile system for sEMG-based hand gesture classification, demonstrating promising performance in adapting individual variability and improving classification accuracy. The proposed method’s performance is evaluated and compared with established approaches using the publicity available NinaPro DB5 dataset. Notably, the proposed simple model, coupled with frequency-based attention modules, achieves accuracies of 89.56% with a quick prediction time of 5ms, showcasing its potential for dexterous control of robots and bionic hands. The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of gesture recognition systems, particularly in the domains of human-computer interaction and prosthetic control.

### [P3-PO: Prescriptive Point Priors for Visuo-Spatial Generalization of Robot Policies]()

Developing generalizable robot policies that can robustly handle varied environmental conditions and object instances remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While considerable efforts have focused on collecting large robot datasets and developing policy architectures to learn from such data, naively learning from visual inputs often results in brittle policies that fail to transfer beyond the training data. This work presents Prescriptive Point Priors for Policies or P3-PO, a novel framework that constructs a unique state representation of the environment leveraging recent advances in computer vision and robot learning to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization for robot manipulation. This representation is obtained through two steps. First, a human annotator prescribes a set of semantically meaningful points on a single demonstration frame. These points are then propagated through the dataset using off-the-shelf vision models. The derived points serve as an input to state-of-the-art policy architectures for policy learning. Our experiments across four real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 43% absolute improvement over prior methods when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, P3-PO exhibits 58% and 80% gains across tasks for new object instances and more cluttered environments respectively. Videos illustrating the robot's performance are best viewed at point-priors.github.io.

### [APA-BI: Adaptive Partition Aggregation and Bidirectional Integration for UAV-View Geo-Localization]()

The task of UAV-view geo-localization is to match a query image with database images to estimate the current geographic location of the query image. This is particularly useful in environments where GPS is not available or when the device fails. Although deep learning methods make sufficient progress in UAV-view geo-localization, they still face challenges in improving the distinguishability of features. For instance, some feature aggregation methods do not consider semantic integrity, and robust elements in the image are not given enough attention. This paper proposes a UAV-view geo-localization method (APA-BI) to tackle the above issues. Specifically, we propose an adaptive partition aggregation method to ensure feature integrity at the semantic level by increasing the receptive field of the classifier module. At the same time, we design a bidirectional integration module to further enhance feature distinguishability by extracting robust tubular topological structures from images. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that APA-BI achieves impressive retrieval accuracy and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the test results of APA-BI in real-world scenarios also show excellent performance.

### [Robo-MUTUAL: Robotic Multimodal Task Specification Via Unimodal Learning]()

Multimodal task specification is essential for enhanced robotic performance, where Cross-modality Alignment enables the robot to holistically understand complex task instructions. Directly annotating multimodal instructions for model training proves impractical, due to the sparsity of paired multimodal data. In this study, we demonstrate that by leveraging unimodal instructions abundant in real data, we can effectively teach robots to learn multimodal task specifications. First, we endow the robot with strong Crossmodality Alignment capabilities, by pretraining a robotic multimodal encoder using extensive out-of-domain data. Then, we employ two Collapse and Corrupt operations to further bridge the remaining modality gap in the learned multimodal representation. This approach projects different modalities of identical task goal as interchangeable representations, thus enabling accurate robotic operations within a well-aligned multimodal latent space. Evaluation across more than 130 tasks and 4000 evaluations on both simulated LIBERO benchmark and real robot platforms showcases the superior capabilities of our proposed framework, demonstrating significant potential in overcoming data constraints in robotic learning.

### [Model Free Method of Screening Training Data for Adversarial Datapoints through Local Lipschitz Quotient Analysis]()

It is often challenging to pick suitable data features for learning problems. Sometimes certain regions of the data are harder to learn because they are not well characterized by the data features. The challenge is amplified when resources for sensing and computation are limited and time-critical yet reliable decisions must be made. For example, a robotic system for preventing falls of elderly people needs a real-time fall predictor, with low false positive and false negative rates, using a simple wearable sensor to activate a fall prevention mechanism. Here we present a methodology for assessing the learnability of data based on the Lipschitz quotient. We develop a procedure for determining which regions of the dataset contain adversarial data points, input data that look similar but belong to different target classes. Regardless of the learning model, it will be hard to learn such data. We then present a method for determining which additional feature(s) are most effective in improving the predictability of each of these regions. This is a model-independent data analysis that can be executed before constructing a prediction model through machine learning or other techniques. We demonstrate this method on two synthetic datasets and a data set of human falls, which uses inertial measurement unit signals. For the fall dataset, we were able to identify two groups of adversarial data points and improve the predictability of each group over the baseline dataset as assessed by Lipschitz by using 2 different sets of features. This work offers a valuable tool for assessing data learnability that can be applied to not only fall prediction problems, but also other robotics applications that learn from data.

### [3D Space Perception Via Disparity Learning Using Stereo Images and an Attention Mechanism: Real-Time Grasping Motion Generation for Transparent Objects]()

Object grasping in 3D space is crucial for robotic applications. Such tasks are performed by utilizing depth map data acquired from RGB-D images or 3D point cloud data. However, these methods struggle when dealing with transparent objects, as transparency limits sensor performance when predicting depth maps. Additionally, the grasping motions are predicted without incorporating the relationship between depth data and motion information, which limits the motion’s flexibility. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose an end-to-end motion generation model using stereo RGB images, a deep-learning model that incorporates image and motion information. Furthermore, visual attention mechanisms are used for extracting task-related attention points, which is essential for building spatial cognition constructs. Real-robot experimental results confirmed that the proposed model is able to grasp transparent objects under various situations, including unseen positions, heights, and background. It was also found that the model self-organized a spatial cognition representation within its hidden states, suggesting that the integrated learning of robot motion and stable spatial attention points is important for spatial perception. Such explicit feature representations cannot be obtained via learning motion alone.

### [Making a Complete Mess and Getting Away with It: Traveling Salesperson Problems with Circle Placement Variants]()

This paper explores a variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where the agent places a circular obstacle next to each node once it visits it. Referred to as the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Circle Placement (TSP-CP), the aim is to maximize the obstacle radius for which a valid closed tour exists and then minimize the tour cost. The TSP-CP finds relevance in various real-world applications, such as harvesting, quarrying, and open-pit mining. We propose several novel solvers to address the TSP-CP, its variant tailored for Dubins vehicles, and a crucial subproblem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem on self-deleting graphs (TSP-SD). Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed solvers outperform the current state-of-the-art on related problems in solution quality.

### [Narrow Passage Path Planning Using Collision Constraint Interpolation]()

Narrow passage path planning is a prevalent problem from industrial to household sites, often facing difficulties in finding feasible paths or requiring excessive computational resources. Given that deep penetration into the environment can cause optimization failure, we propose a framework to ensure feasibility throughout the process using a series of subproblems tailored for narrow passage problem. We begin by decomposing the environment into convex objects and initializing collision constraints with a subset of these objects. By continuously interpolating the collision constraints through the process of sequentially introducing remaining objects, our proposed framework generates subproblems that guide the optimization toward solving the narrow passage problem. Several examples are presented to demonstrate how the proposed framework addresses narrow passage path planning problems.

### [Trajectory Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Costs Using Deterministic Path Integral Optimization]()

Formulating the intended behavior of a dynamic system can be challenging. Signal temporal logic (STL) is frequently used for this purpose due to its suitability in formalizing comprehensible, modular, and versatile spatio-temporal specifications. Due to scaling issues with respect to the complexity of the specifications and the potential occurrence of non-differentiable terms, classical optimization methods often solve STL-based problems inefficiently. Smoothing and approximation techniques can alleviate these issues but require changing the optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel sampling-based method based on model predictive path integral control to solve optimal control problems with STL cost functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark motion planning problems and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method efficiently solves optimal control problems with STL costs.

### [Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Conflict-Based Search and Structural-Semantic Topometric Maps]()

As industries increasingly adopt large robotic fleets, there is a pressing need for computationally efficient, practical, and optimal conflict-free path planning for multiple robots. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular method for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) due to its completeness and optimality; however, it is often impractical for real-world applications, as it is computationally intensive to solve and relies on assumptions about agents and operating environments that are difficult to realize. This article proposes a solution to overcome computational challenges and practicality issues of CBS by utilizing structural-semantic topometric maps. Instead of running CBS over large grid-based maps, the proposed solution runs CBS over a sparse topometric map containing structural-semantic cells representing intersections, pathways, and dead ends. This approach significantly accelerates the MAPF process and reduces the number of conflict resolutions handled by CBS while operating in continuous time. In the proposed method, robots are assigned time ranges to move between topometric regions, departing from the traditional CBS assumption that a robot can move to any connected cell in a single time step. The approach is validated through real-world multi-robot path-finding experiments and benchmarking simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MAPF method can be applied to real-world non-holonomic robots and yields significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to traditional CBS methods while improving conflict detection and resolution in cases of corridor symmetries.

### [Topo-Geometrically Distinct Path Computation Using Neighborhood-Augmented Graph, and Its Application to Path Planning for a Tethered Robot in 3D]()

Many robotics applications benefit from being able to compute multiple geodesic paths in a given configuration space. Existing paradigm is to use topological path planning, which can compute optimal paths in distinct topological classes. However, these methods usually require non-trivial geometric constructions which are prohibitively expensive in 3D, and are unable to distinguish between distinct topologically equivalent geodesics that are created due to high-cost/curvature regions or prismatic obstacles in 3D. In this paper, we propose an approach to compute k geodesic paths using the concept of a novel neighborhood-augmented graph, on which graph search algorithms can compute multiple optimal paths that are topo-geometrically distinct. Our approach does not require complex geometric constructions, and the resulting paths are not restricted to distinct topological classes, making the algorithm suitable for problems where finding and distinguishing between geodesic paths are of interest. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm to planning shortest traversible paths for a tethered robot in 3D with cable-length constraint.

### [Homotopy-Aware Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Cluttered Environments]()

Mobile robot navigation architectures that employ a planning algorithm to provide a single optimal path to follow are flawed in the presence of unstructured, rapidly changing environments. As the environment updates, optimal plans often oscillate around discrete obstacles, which is problematic for path following controllers that are biased to follow the planned route. A potentially better approach involves the generation of multiple plans, each optimal within their own homotopy class, to provide a more comprehensive approximation of cost to goal for a path-following controller. In this paper, we present Homotopy-Aware Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (HAEASL), which uses multiple open lists to bias search towards routes with distinct homotopy classes. Experiments are presented that measure the number, the optimality, and the diversity of solutions generated across 3,200 planning problems in 80 randomly generated environments. The performance of HAEASL is benchmarked against two previous approaches: Search-Based Path Planning with Homotopy Class Constraints (A*HC) and Homotopy-Aware RRT* (HARRT*). Experimental results demonstrate that HAEASL can generate a greater number of paths and more diverse paths than A*HC without a significant reduction of optimality. Additionally, results demonstrate that HAEASL generates a greater number of paths and ones with lower costs than HARRT*. A final demonstration of HAEASL generating multiple solutions subject to temporal, resource, and kinodynamic constraints using data collected from an off-road mobile robot illustrates the suitability of the approach for the motivating example.

### [Initial Task Allocation in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams: An Attention-Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach]()

Multi-human multi-robot teams (MH-MR) obtain tremendous potential in tackling intricate and massive missions by merging distinct strengths and expertise of individual members. The inherent heterogeneity of these teams necessitates advanced initial task allocation (ITA) methods that align tasks with the intrinsic capabilities of team members from the outset. While existing reinforcement learning approaches show encouraging results, they might fall short in addressing the nuances of long-horizon ITA problems, particularly in settings with large-scale MH-MR teams or multifaceted tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose an attention-enhanced hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that decomposes the complex ITA problem into structured sub-problems, facilitating more efficient allocations. To bolster sub-policy learning, we introduce a hierarchical cross-attribute attention (HCA) mechanism, encouraging each sub-policy within the hierarchy to discern and leverage the specific nuances in the state space that are crucial for its respective decision-making phase. Through an extensive environmental surveillance case study, we demonstrate the benefits of our model and the HCA inside.

### [Enabling Multi-Robot Collaboration from Single-Human Guidance]()

Learning collaborative behaviors is essential for multi-agent systems. Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. We instead propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans have the natural ability to take on various roles in a team. We show that by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period of time and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates, agents can effectively learn to collaborate. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.

### [Fan-Out Revisited: The Impact of the Human Element on Scalability of Human Multi-Robot Teams]()

This paper introduces a novel fan-out model that improves accuracy over previous models. The commonly used models rely on neglect time, the time an agent operates independently, which confounds both human and robot abilities. The proposed model separates neglect time into two functionally distinct concepts: the time a robot can operate self-sufficiently, and the time a human estimates the robot can do so. Previous research indicates fan-out is often overestimated. This work explains why robot ability provides an upper bound to fanout, but that actual achieved fan-out is influenced by both the human and robot abilities. We conduct a study to validate this new model and show improved performance over the two most common fan-out models. The results show that both previous models overestimate as predicted. Using the new fan-out model, we show that as the difference between human estimation and robot abilities grows, the actual fan-out will fall further from the upper bound potential fan-out. By including assessments of both the robotic and human elements, the new model provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics at play and the factors involved in scaling Human Multi-Robot Teams.

### [HARP: Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning]()

Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning integrates human expertise to accelerate agent learning and provide critical guidance and feedback in complex fields. However, many existing approaches focus on single-agent tasks and require continuous human involvement during the training process, significantly increasing the human workload and limiting scalability. In this paper, we propose HARP (Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic), a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for group-oriented tasks. HARP integrates automatic agent regrouping with strategic human assistance during deployment, enabling and allowing non-experts to offer effective guidance with minimal intervention. During training, agents dynamically adjust their groupings to optimize collaborative task completion. When deployed, they actively seek human assistance and utilize the Permutation Invariant Group Critic to evaluate and refine human-proposed groupings, allowing non-expert users to contribute valuable suggestions. In multiple collaboration scenarios, our approach is able to leverage limited guidance from non-experts and enhance performance. The project can be found at https://github.com/huawen-hu/HARP.

### [Training Human-Robot Teams by Improving Transparency through a Virtual Spectator Interface]()

After-action reviews (AARs) are professional discussions that help operators and teams enhance their task performance by analyzing completed missions with peers and professionals. Previous studies comparing different formats of AARs have focused mainly on human teams. However, the inclusion of robotic teammates brings along new challenges in understanding teammate intent and communication. Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission. The proposed VSI primarily utilizes visual feedback to review subjects’ behavior. To examine the effectiveness of VSI, we took elements from AAR to conduct our own TR, and designed a 1 × 3 between-subjects experiment with experimental conditions: TR with (1) VSI, (2) screen recording, and (3) non-technology (only verbal descriptions). The results of our experiments demonstrated that the VSI did not result in significantly better team performance than other conditions. However, the TR with VSI led to more improvement in the subjects’ SA over the other conditions.

### [Adaptive Task Allocation in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams under Team Heterogeneity and Dynamic Information Uncertainty]()

Task allocation in multi-human multi-robot (MH-MR) teams presents significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of team members, the dynamics of task execution, and the information uncertainty of operational states. Existing approaches often fail to address these challenges simultaneously, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose an adaptive task allocation method using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), incorporating initial task allocation (ITA) that leverages team heterogeneity and conditional task reallocation in response to dynamic operational states. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary state representation learning task to manage information uncertainty and enhance task execution. Through an extensive case study in large-scale environmental monitoring tasks, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach. More details are available on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/ata-hrl.

### [“Don’t Forget to Put the Milk Back!” Dataset for Enabling Embodied Agents to Detect Anomalous Situations]()

Home robots intend to make their users lives easier. Our work aims to assist in this goal by enabling robots to inform their users of dangerous or unsanitary anomalies in their home. Some examples of these anomalies include the user leaving their milk out, forgetting to turn off the stove, or leaving poison accessible to children. To move towards enabling home robots with these abilities, we have created a new dataset, which we call SafetyDetect. The SafetyDetect dataset consists of 1000 anomalous home scenes, each of which contains unsafe or unsanitary situations for an agent to detect. Our approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) alongside both a graph representation of the scene and the relationships between the objects in the scene. Our key insight is that this connected scene graph and the object relationships it encodes enables the LLM to better reason about the scene --- especially as it relates to detecting dangerous or unsanitary situations. Our most promising approach utilizes GPT-4 and pursues a classification technique where object relations from the scene graph are classified as normal, dangerous, unsanitary, or dangerous for children. This method is able to correctly identify over 90% of anomalous scenarios in the SafetyDetect Dataset. Additionally, we conduct real world experiments on a ClearPath TurtleBot where we generate a scene graph from visuals of the real world scene, and run our approach with no modification. This setup resulted in little performance loss. The SafetyDetect dataset and code will be released to the public upon this papers publication.

### [Development of Contactless Delivery Service Robot with Modular Working Platform in Isolation Wards]()

Preventing cross-infection is crucial for robots designed to assist medical staff in isolation wards during outbreaks of infectious diseases like COVID-19. This paper proposes a modular robotic system with a working platform and a mobile base to prevent cross-infection during item delivery and waste transport. An alignment structure for combining the two platforms is introduced, and a marker map and barcode-based destination input system were developed to allow medical staff without specialized robotics knowledge to use the system without additional training. The effectiveness of this robot's service was evaluated through a System Usability Scale (SUS) test with twenty medical staff working in isolation wards, achieving an average score of 77.12. This indicates a high level of usability, suggesting that this robot can significantly contribute to safe and efficient hospital operations during pandemic situations.

### [RACCOON: Grounding Embodied Question-Answering with State Summaries from Existing Robot Modules]()

Explainability is vital for establishing user trust, also in robotics. Recently, foundation models (e.g. vision-language models, VLMs) fostered a wave of embodied agents that answer arbitrary queries about their environment and their interactions with it. However, naively prompting VLMs to answer queries based on camera images does not take into account existing robot architectures which represent the robot's tasks, skills, and beliefs about the state of the world. To overcome this limitation, we propose RACCOON, a framework that combines foundation models' responses with a robot's internal knowledge. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), RACCOON selects relevant context, retrieves information from the robot's state, and utilizes it to refine prompts for an LLM to answer questions accurately. This bridges the gap between the model's adaptability and the robot's domain expertise.

### [GRACE: Generating Socially Appropriate Robot Actions Leveraging LLMs and Human Explanations]()

When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.

### [Robi Butler: Multimodal Remote Interaction with a Household Robot Assistant]()

Imagine a future when we can Zoom-call a robot to manage household chores remotely. This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.

### [AdaptBot: Combining LLM with Knowledge Graphs and Human Input for Generic-To-Specific Task Decomposition and Knowledge Refinement]()

An embodied agent assisting humans is often asked to complete new tasks, and there may not be sufficient time or labeled examples to train the agent to perform these new tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains can be used to predict a sequence of abstract actions for completing such tasks, although the agent may not be able to execute this sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge. Based on experimental evaluation in the context of cooking and cleaning tasks in simulation domains, we demonstrate that the interplay between LLM, KG, and human input leads to substantial performance gains compared with just using the LLM.

### [LCD-RIG: Limited Communication Decentralized Robotic Information Gathering Systems]()

Effective data collection in collaborative information-gathering systems relies heavily on maintaining uninterrupted connectivity. Yet, real-world communication disruptions often pose challenges to information-gathering processes. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method —a limited communication decentralized information gathering system for multiple robots to explore environmental phenomena characterized as unknown spatial fields. Our method leverages quadtree structures to ensure comprehensive workspace coverage and efficient exploration. Unlike traditional systems that depend on global and synchronous communication, our method enables robots to share local experiences within a limited transmission range and coordinate their tasks through pairwise and asynchronous communication. Information estimation is facilitated by a Gaussian Process with an Attentive Kernel, allowing adaptive capturing of crucial behavior and data patterns. Our proposed system undergoes validation through simulated scalar field studies in non-stationary environments where multiple robots explore spatial fields. Theoretical guarantees ensure the convergence of distributed area coverage and the regret bounds of distributed online scalar field mapping. We also validate the applicability of our method empirically in a water quality monitoring scenario featuring two Autonomous Surface Vehicles, tasked with constructing a spatial field.

### [Multi-Agent Path Planning in Complex Environments Using Gaussian Belief Propagation with Global Path Finding]()

Multi-agent path planning is a critical challenge in robotics, requiring agents to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions and optimizing travel efficiency. This work addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining Gaussian belief propagation with path integration and introducing a novel tracking factor to ensure strict adherence to global paths. The proposed method is tested with two different global path-planning approaches: rapidly exploring random trees and a structured planner, which leverages predefined lane structures to improve coordination. A simulation environment was developed to validate the proposed method across diverse scenarios, each posing unique challenges in navigation and communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the tracking factor reduces path deviation by 28% in single-agent and 16% in multi-agent scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in improving multi-agent coordination, especially when combined with structured global planning.

### [Olympus: A Jumping Quadruped for Planetary Exploration Utilizing Reinforcement Learning for In-Flight Attitude Control]()

Exploring planetary bodies with lower gravity, such as the moon and Mars, allows legged robots to utilize jumping as an efficient form of locomotion thus giving them a valuable advantage over traditional rovers for exploration. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents the design, simulation, and learning-based "in-flight" attitude control of Olympus, a jumping legged robot tailored to the gravity of Mars. First, the design requirements are outlined followed by detailing how simulation enabled optimizing the robot's design - from its legs to the overall configuration - towards high vertical jumping, forward jumping distance, and in-flight attitude reorientation. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning policy used to track desired in-flight attitude maneuvers is presented. Successfully crossing the sim2real gap, extensive experimental studies of attitude reorientation tests are demonstrated.

### [THAMP-3D: Tangent-Based Hybrid A* Motion Planning for Tethered Robots in Sloped 3D Terrains]()

This paper introduces a novel motion planning algorithm designed for a team of curvature-constrained tethered robots operating on sloped 3D terrains. Our approach addresses the critical issues of tether-terrain interaction, robot stability, and tether entanglement avoidance. The study focuses on a two-robot system, where stability is primarily dependent on tether tension, which is in turn limited by wheel traction. We propose a path-planning method that strategically utilizes terrain features (e.g., rocks) to augment tether tension through additional friction, thereby enhancing overall system stability. Our algorithm employs a modified tangent graph as the underlying structure for a hybrid A^* search, incorporating stability constraints throughout the planning process. The proposed method is extensively evaluated through various simulation experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in planning safe and efficient paths.

### [Deep Learning Based Topography Aware Gas Source Localization with Mobile Robot]()

Gas source localization in complex environments is critical for applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and disaster response. Traditional methods often struggle with the challenges posed by a lack of environmental topography integration, especially when interactions between wind and obstacles distort gas dispersion patterns. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach, which leverages spatial context and environmental mapping to enhance gas source localization. By integrating Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a U-Net-based model, our method predicts the likelihood of gas source locations by analyzing gas sensor data, wind flow, and topography of the environment represented by a 2D occupancy map. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a wheeled robot equipped with a photoionization detector, a LIDAR, and an anemometer, in various scenarios with dynamic wind fields and multiple obstacles. The results show that our approach can robustly locate gas sources, even in challenging environments with fluctuating wind directions, outperforming conventional methods by utilizing topography contextual information. This study underscores the importance of topographical context in gas source localization and offers a flexible and robust solution for real-world applications. Data and code are publicly available.

### [Gas Source Localization in Unknown Indoor Environments Using Dual-Mode Information-Theoretic Search]()

This paper proposes a dual-mode planner for localizing gas sources using a mobile sensor in unknown indoor spaces. The complexity of indoor environments creates constraints on search paths, leading to situations where no valid paths can be generated, which are termed as dead end in this paper. The proposed dual-mode planner is designed to effectively address the dead end problem while maintaining efficient search paths. In addition, the absence of analytical dispersion models that can be used in unknown indoor environments presents another critical issue for indoor gas source localization (GSL). To address this, we present an indoor Gaussian dispersion model (IGDM) that can analytically model indoor gas dispersion without a complete map. Finally, we establish a GSL framework for indoor environments along with real-time mapping, utilizing the dual-mode planner and IGDM. This framework is validated in indoor scenarios with the realistic gas dispersion simulator. The simulation results show the high success rate of the proposed method, its ability to reduce search time, and its computational efficiency. Furthermore, through real-world experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach as a practical solution, evidenced by its satisfactory performance

### [Online Design Optimization of Passive Exoskeletons Using Fast Biomechanics Simulation and Reinforcement Learning]()

Exoskeletons are being adopted as assistive devices in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and construction, aimed at reducing musculoskeletal loads in workers. Presently, their design process assumes the user to be quasi-static, optimizing the design parameters for reduction of human joint torques followed by fine-tuning through usability studies and physical prototyping. We present a method for optimizing passive exoskeleton designs before the physical prototyping stage for muscle effort reduction in dynamic tasks such as arm reaching and walking. We employ fast MuJoCo-based simulations of human biomechanics to compute the joint torques, muscle forces and muscle activations while executing task trajectories using pre-trained reinforcement learning models from the literature. We train another set of reinforcement learning models that minimize joint torques and muscle effort rates by varying the exoskeleton's design parameters online during the task motions. Baselines for comparison include the default designs of shoulder and walking assist exoskeletons from the literature, and designs obtained through conventional optimization techniques. In terms of muscle effort rates, the RL-based designs improved upon these baselines by an average of 3.42% and 1.96% respectively in the arm reaching task, and 6.28% and 5.81% in the walking task. Our method can be adapted to evaluate exoskeletons in real-time through motion capture, and for muscle-aware online control of powered exoskeletons.

### [Accurately Modeling the Output Torque and Stiffness of Ankle-Foot Orthoses with a Compliant Linkage Model]()

The stiffness of passive lower-limb exoskeletons and orthoses governs their assistance. A common practice in the design of these systems is to assume the stiffness of the device is determined only by the intended elastic element (e.g., spring), while the structural components, human attachments, and soft tissues are considered rigid. In practice, the mechanical behavior of orthoses is significantly affected by the compliance of these elements, which drastically impacts the assistance provided. In this work, we present a linkage model with compliant elements that can accurately predict the applied stiffness of ankle-foot orthoses, and retroactively estimate the stiffness of unintended spring elements from published data. The compliant model accurately predicted the torque trajectories of two published passive orthoses with modeled peak torques within 4% to 7% of measured values. In contrast, the rigid model greatly overestimated the peak torques, predicting 203% to 376% of the measured values. The compliant model also indicated that an onboard joint encoder could only measure 52% to 69% of the peak ankle angle recorded with motion capture. The compliant model was also used to reassess the stiffness range of a variable-stiffness orthosis, indicating that its adjustable range is likely 69% of rigid model predictions. Overall, this work highlights the need to consider how unmodeled compliance affects the mechanical behavior of orthoses and provides a foundation for further exploration.

### [Towards Neurorobotic Interface for Finger Joint Angle Estimation: A Multi-Stage CNN-LSTM Network with Transfer Learning]()

To maximize the autonomy of individuals with upper limb amputations in daily activities, leveraging forearm muscle information to infer movement intent is a promising research direction. While current prosthetic hand technologies can utilize forearm muscle data to achieve basic movements such as grasping, accurately estimating finger joint angles remains a significant challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Stage Cascade Convolutional Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory Network, where an upsampling module is introduced before the downsampling module to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we designed a transfer learning (TL) framework based on parameter freezing, where the pre-trained downsampling module is fixed, and only the upsampling module is updated with a small amount of out-of-distribution data to achieve TL. Furthermore, we compared the performance of unimodal and multimodal models, collecting surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, brightness mode ultrasound images (B-mode US images), and motion capture data simultaneously. The results show that on the validation set, the US image had the lowest error, while on the prediction set, the four-channel sEMG achieved the lowest error. The performance of the multimodal model in both datasets was intermediate between the unimodal models. On the prediction set, the average normalized root mean square error values for the four-channel sEMG, US images, and sensor fusion models across three subjects were 0.170, 0.203, and 0.186, respectively. By utilizing advanced sensor fusion techniques and TL, our approach can reduce the need for extensive data collection and training for new users, making prosthetic control more accessible and adaptable to individual needs.

### [Design, Characterization, and Validation of a Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Elbow]()

Intuitively, prostheses with user-controllable stiffness could mimic the intrinsic behavior of the human musculoskeletal system, promoting safe and natural interactions and task adaptability in real-world scenarios. However, prosthetic design often disregards compliance because of the additional complexity, weight, and needed control channels. This article focuses on designing a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) with weight, size, and performance compatible with prosthetic applications, addressing its implementation for the elbow joint. While a direct biomimetic approach suggests adopting an agonist-antagonist (AA) layout to replicate the biceps and triceps brachii with elastic actuation, this solution is not optimal to accommodate the varied morphologies of residual limbs. Instead, we employed the AA layout to craft an elbow prosthesis fully contained in the user’s forearm, catering to individuals with distal transhumeral amputations. In addition, we introduce a variant of this design where the two motors are split in the upper arm and forearm to distribute mass and volume more evenly along the bionic limb, enhancing comfort for patients with more proximal amputation levels. We characterize and validate our approach, demonstrating that both architectures meet the target requirements for an elbow prosthesis. The system attains the desired 120◦ range of motion, achieves the target stiffness range of [2, 60] N ・ m/rad, and can actively lift up to 3 kg. Our novel design reduces weight by up to 50% compared to existing VSAs for elbow prostheses while achieving performance comparable to the state of the art. Case studies suggest that passive and variable compliance could enable robust and safe interactions and task adaptability in the real world.

### [Long-Term Upper-Limb Prosthesis Myocontrol Via High-Density sEMG and Incremental Learning]()

Noninvasive human-machine interfaces such as surface electromyography (sEMG) have long been employed for controlling robotic prostheses. However, classical controllers are limited to few degrees of freedom (DoF). More recently, machine learning methods have been proposed to learn personalized controllers from user data. While promising, they often suffer from distribution shift during long-term usage, requiring costly model re-training. Moreover, most prosthetic sEMG sensors have low spatial density, which limits accuracy and the number of controllable motions. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing a novel myoelectric prosthetic system integrating a high density-sEMG (HD-sEMG) setup and incremental learning methods to accurately control 7 motions of the Hannes prosthesis. First, we present a newly designed, compact HD-sEMG interface equipped with 64 dry electrodes positioned over the forearm. Then, we introduce an efficient incremental learning system enabling model adaptation on a stream of data. We thoroughly analyze multiple learning algorithms across 7 subjects, including one with limb absence, and 6 sessions held in different days covering an extended period of several months. The size and time span of the collected data represent a relevant contribution for studying long-term myocontrol performance. Therefore, we release the DELTA dataset together with our experimental code.

### [ChatEMG: Synthetic Data Generation to Control a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Stroke]()

Intent inferral on a hand orthosis for stroke patients is challenging due to the difficulty of data collection. Additionally, EMG signals exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions, and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition, session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient session, including the use of the classifier for functional orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.

### [Language-Grounded Dynamic Scene Graphs for Interactive Object Search with Mobile Manipulation]()

To fully leverage the capabilities of mobile manipulation robots, it is imperative that they are able to autonomously execute long-horizon tasks in large unexplored environments. While large language models (LLMs) have shown emergent reasoning skills on arbitrary tasks, existing work primarily concentrates on explored environments, typically focusing on either navigation or manipulation tasks in isolation. In this work, we propose MoMa-LLM, a novel approach that grounds language models within structured representations derived from open-vocabulary scene graphs, dynamically updated as the environment is explored. We tightly interleave these representations with an object-centric action space. The resulting approach, given object detections, is zero-shot, open-vocabulary, and readily extendable to a spectrum of mobile manipulation and household robotic tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa-LLM in a novel semantic interactive search task in large realistic indoor environments. In extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we show substantially improved search efficiency compared to conventional baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, as well as its applicability to more abstract tasks. We make the code publicly available at https://moma-llm.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [Here's Your PDDL Problem File! on Using VLMs for Generating Symbolic PDDL Problem Files]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant text but lack logical reasoning abilities. They rely on statistical patterns rather than logical inference, making them unreliable for structured decision-making. Integrating LLMs with task planning can address this limitation by combining their natural language understanding with the precise, goal-oriented reasoning of planners. This paper introduces ViPlan, a hybrid system that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract high-level semantic information from visual and textual inputs while integrating classical planners for logical reasoning. ViPlan utilizes VLMs to generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful PDDL problem files from images and natural language instructions, which are then processed by a task planner to generate an executable plan. The entire process is embedded within a behavior tree framework, enhancing efficiency, reactivity, replanning, modularity, and flexibility. The generation and planning capabilities of ViPlan are empirically evaluated with simulated and real-world experiments.

### [MuST: Multi-Head Skill Transformer for Long-Horizon Dexterous Manipulation with Skill Progress]()

Robot picking and packing tasks require dexterous manipulation skills, such as rearranging objects to establish a good grasping pose, or placing and pushing items to achieve tight packing. These tasks are challenging for robots due to the complexity and variability of the required actions. To tackle the difficulty of learning and executing long-horizon tasks, we propose a novel framework called the Multi-Head Skill Transformer (MuST). This model is designed to learn and sequentially chain together multiple motion primitives (skills), enabling robots to perform complex sequences of actions effectively. MuST introduces a "progress value" for each skill, guiding the robot on which skill to execute next and ensuring smooth transitions between skills. Additionally, our model is capable of expanding its skill set and managing various sequences of sub-tasks efficiently. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that MuST significantly enhances the robot's ability to perform long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks. The accompanying video is available online.

### [CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills Using Large Language Models]()

Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating a sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in the real-world. Project website is https://iconlab.negarmehr.com/CurricuLLM/

### [PUGS: Zero-Shot Physical Understanding with Gaussian Splatting]()

Current robotic systems can understand the categories and poses of objects well. But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction. We provide extensive quantitative ablations and qualitative visualization to demonstrate the mechanism of our designs. We show the proposed methodology can help address challenging real-world grasping tasks. Our codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/EverNorif/PUGS

### [ViewInfer3D: 3D Visual Grounding Based on Embodied Viewpoint Inference]()

3D Visual Grounding (3D VG) is a fundamental task in embodied intelligence, which entails robots interpreting natural language descriptions to locate objects within 3D environments. The complexity of this task emerges as robots perceive the spatial relationships of objects differently depending on their observational viewpoints. In this work, we propose ViewInfer3D, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer embodied viewpoints, thereby avoiding incorrect observational viewpoints. To enhance the reliability and speed of reasoning from embodied viewpoints, we have designed three sub-strategies: constructing a hierarchical 3D scene graph, implementing embodied viewpoint parsing, and applying scene graph reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this framework can improve performance in 3D Visual Grounding tasks through embodied viewpoint reasoning. Our framework achieves the best performance among all zeroshot methods on the ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets, without significantly increasing inference time.

### [Image-Guided Surgical Planning for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Using CTRs: A Phantom-Based Study]()

In this paper, we validate the effectiveness of the optimal planning algorithms we have developed for devising surgical plans for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) using patient-specific Concentric-Tube Robots (CTRs). To do so, we built a life-sized phantom model of the right hemithorax, replicating the anatomy of a patient who suffered from kidney stone and underwent conventional PCNL. Two-dimensional CT scans of the phantom model and its 3D reconstruction enabled the creation of a surgical plan using our planning algorithms based on a puncture into the mid-pole of the kidney. This was compared with two other percutaneous tracts involving punctures into the lower and upper calyces for comparison. The optimal mid-pole plan achieved 84% stone coverage, significantly outperforming the lower pole (58%) and upper pole (45%) plans. These results validate the effectiveness of the algorithms and align with simulation-based findings from previous studies, which reported an average volume coverage of 81.6±19.6% in clinical cases.

### [Vision-Based Automatic Control of a Surgical Robot for Posterior Segment Ophthalmic Surgery (I)]()

In ophthalmic surgery, especially in posterior segment procedures, clinicians face significant challenges, like the inherent tremor of the surgeon’s arm, restricted visibility, and heavy reliance on the surgeon’s skills for precise control of hand-held tools during micro-surgical movements. Automatic control of robotic-assisted ophthalmic surgical systems has the potential to overcome these challenges, simplifying complex surgical procedures. This paper proposes a novel image-guided automatic control method for an Ophthalmic micro-Surgical Robot (OmSR), specifically designed for posterior segment eye surgery. The method relies on forceps shadow tracking. The paper introduces a tip detection network (Net-SR), which accurately calculates the coordinates of the Tips of Surgical Forceps (ToSF) and Tips of Shadow (ToS) to enable automatic navigation. Additionally, through the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve interpolation and speed look-ahead algorithm, dense and time-continuous data points are obtained to improve control accuracy and smoothness. The accuracy of the Net-SR network and motion of the ToSF, and the effectiveness of the proposed automatic controller are experimentally evaluated. Results demonstrate a significant 98.21% improvement in the Net-SR network accuracy over the normal keypoint detection network. The use of the speed look-ahead algorithm leads to a notable 41.7% improvement in optimal speed, and the ToSF successfully reaches the target lesion.

### [ETSM: Automating Dissection Trajectory Suggestion and Confidence Map-Based Safety Margin Prediction for Robot-Assisted Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection]()

Robot-assisted Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) improves the surgical procedure by providing a more comprehensive view through advanced robotic instruments and bimanual operation, thereby enhancing dissection efficiency and accuracy. Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with 1849 short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only 3.18. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice. The dataset and code will be made available.

### [Partial-To-Full Registration Based on Gradient-SDF for Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery]()

In computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), accurate pre-operative to intra-operative bone registration is an essential and critical requirement for providing navigational guidance. This registration process is challenging since the intra-operative 3D points are sparse, only partially overlapped with the pre-operative model, and disturbed by noise and outliers. The commonly used method in current state-of-the-art orthopedic robotic system is bony landmarks based registration, but it is very time-consuming for the surgeons. To address these issues, we propose a novel partial-to-full registration framework based on gradient-SDF for CAOS. The simulation experiments using bone models from publicly available datasets and the phantom experiments performed under both optical tracking and electromagnetic tracking systems demonstrate that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than standard benchmarks and be robust to 90% outliers. Importantly, our method achieves convergence in less than 1 second in real scenarios and mean target registration error values as low as 2.198 mm for the entire bone model. Finally, it only requires random acquisition of points for registration by moving a surgical probe over the bone surface without correspondence with any specific bony landmarks, thus showing significant potential clinical value. The code of the framework is available.

### [Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control for Volumetric Ablation in Robotic Laser Surgery]()

Laser-based surgical ablation relies heavily on surgeon involvement, restricting precision to the limits of human error and perception. The interaction between laser and tissue is governed by various laser parameters that control the laser irradiance on the tissue, including the power, distance, spot size, orientation, and exposure time. This complex interaction lends itself to robotic automation, allowing the surgeon to focus on high-level tasks, such as choosing the region and method of ablation, while the lower-level ablation plan can be handled autonomously. This paper describes a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme to plan ablation sequences for arbitrary tissue volumes. Using a steady-state point ablation model to simulate a single laser-tissue interaction, a random search technique explores the reachable state space while preserving sensitive tissue regions. The sampled MPC strategy provides an ablation sequence that accounts for parameter uncertainty without violating constraints, such as avoiding nerve bundles.

### [SuFIA-BC: Generating High Quality Demonstration Data for Visuomotor Policy Learning in Surgical Subtasks]()

Behavior cloning facilitates the learning of dexterous manipulation skills, yet the complexity of surgical environments, the difficulty and expense of obtaining patient data, and robot calibration errors present unique challenges for surgical robot learning. We provide an enhanced surgical digital twin with photorealistic human anatomical organs, integrated into a comprehensive simulator designed to generate high-quality synthetic data to solve fundamental tasks in surgical autonomy. We present SuFIA-BC: visual Behavior Cloning policies for Surgical First Interactive Autonomy Assistants. We investigate visual observation spaces including multi-view cameras and 3D visual representations extracted from a single endoscopic camera view. Through systematic evaluation, we find that the diverse set of photorealistic surgical tasks introduced in this work enables a comprehensive evaluation of prospective behavior cloning models for the unique challenges posed by surgical environments. We observe that current state-of-the-art behavior cloning techniques struggle to solve the contact-rich and complex tasks evaluated in this work, regardless of their underlying perception or control architectures. These findings highlight the importance of customizing perception pipelines and control architectures, as well as curating larger-scale synthetic datasets that meet the specific demands of surgical tasks.

### [Vegetable Peeling: A Case Study in Constrained Dexterous Manipulation]()

Recent studies have made significant progress in addressing dexterous manipulation problems, particularly in in-hand object reorientation. However, there are few existing works that explore the potential utilization of developed dexterous manipulation controllers for downstream tasks. In this study, we focus on constrained dexterous manipulation for food peeling. Food peeling presents various constraints on the reorientation controller, such as the requirement for the hand to securely hold the object after reorientation for peeling. We propose a simple system for learning a reorientation controller that facilitates the subsequent peeling task.

### [Prompt-Responsive Object Retrieval with Memory-Augmented Student-Teacher Learning]()

Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the Segment-Anything 2 model as a perception backbone to infer an object of interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and code are available at https://memory-student-teacher.github.io.

### [Implicit Articulated Robot Morphology Modeling with Configuration Space Neural Signed Distance Functions]()

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to implicitly encode precise robot morphology using forward kinematics based on a configuration space signed distance function. Our proposed Robot Neural Distance Function (RNDF) optimizes the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy for signed distance queries conditioned on the robot's configuration for each link. Compared to the baseline method, the proposed approach achieves an 81.1% reduction in distance error while utilizing only 47.6% of model parameters. Its parallelizable and differentiable nature provides direct access to joint-space derivatives, enabling a seamless connection between robot planning in Cartesian task space and configuration space. These features make RNDF an ideal surrogate model for general robot optimization and learning in 3D spatial planning tasks. Specifically, we apply RNDF to robotic arm-hand modeling and demonstrate its potential as a core platform for whole-arm, collision-free grasp planning in cluttered environments. The code and model are available at https://github.com/robotic-manipulation/RNDF.

### [A Data-Efficient Progressive Learning Framework for Robot Scooping Task]()

Robot scooping is a challenging and important task in robotic tool manipulation research due to the complex relationship between the robot, the tool, and target objects/environment. Taking into account different tools, different target objects and varying environments, the required scooping manipulation strategy usually varies greatly. Even considering a specific type of spoon, the question of how to obtain a policy model that requires less demonstration data but shows better generalization capabilities deserves further exploration. In this paper, we propose a progressive learning framework for general robot scooping tasks, which requires a limited number of demonstrations but shows promising generalization capability. We first learn a scooping policy via human demonstrations with a specific setup. We then use this as a pre-train model for reinforcement learning in a curriculum manner to achieve a scooping strategy that is generalizable to different task setups. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of the policy with a series of experiments both in simulation and on a real robot.

### [Manipulability Transfer and Tracking Control: Bridging Domain Adaptation with Predictive Feasibility]()

This paper introduces a novel framework for improving human-to-robot manipulability transfer and tracking in Learning by Demonstration. Our approach addresses key challenges, including manipulability ellipsoid (ME) domain adaptation between different kinematic structures, ME-IK feasibility checks and optimization across trajectories accounting for the robot's redundancy, and introducing a manipulability-aware control strategy. Leveraging a unified quadratic programming control with vector-field inequalities, our method enables robust tracking and optimization of manipulability, accommodating multiple demonstrations and the inherent variability in task execution. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in precise tracking and force generation compared to traditional methods, highlighting the advantages of incorporating human implicit information for more effective robot control.

### [Adaptive Contact-Rich Manipulation through Few-Shot Imitation Learning with Force-Torque Feedback and Pre-Trained Object Representations]()

Imitation learning offers a pathway for robots to perform repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more engaging and meaningful activities. However, challenges arise from the need for extensive demonstrations and the disparity between training and real-world environments. This paper focuses on contact-rich tasks like wiping with soft and deformable objects, requiring adaptive force control to handle variations in wiping surface height and the sponge's physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates real-time force-torque (FT) feedback with pre-trained object representations. This approach allows robots to dynamically adjust to previously unseen changes in surface heights and sponges' physical properties. In real-world experiments, our method achieved 96% accuracy in applying the average reference force, significantly outperforming the previous method that lacked an FT feedback loop, which only achieved 4% accuracy. To evaluate the adaptability of our approach, we conducted experiments under different conditions from the training setup, involving 40 scenarios using 10 sponges with varying physical properties and 4 types of wiping surface heights, demonstrating significant improvements in the robot's adaptability by analyzing force trajectories.

### [GS-EVT: Cross-Modal Event Camera Tracking Based on Gaussian Splatting]()

Reliable self-localization is a foundational skill for many intelligent mobile platforms. This paper explores the use of event cameras for motion tracking thereby providing a solution with inherent robustness under difficult dynamics and illumination. In order to circumvent the challenge of event camera-based mapping, the solution is framed in a cross-modal way. It tracks a map representation that comes directly from frame-based cameras. Specifically, the proposed method operates on top of gaussian splatting, a state-of-the-art representation that permits highly efficient and realistic novel view synthesis. The key of our approach consists of a novel pose parametrization that uses a reference pose plus first order dynamics for local differential image rendering. The latter is then compared against images of integrated events in a staggered coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. As demonstrated by our results, the realistic view rendering ability of gaussian splatting leads to stable and accurate tracking across a variety of both publicly available and newly recorded data sequences.

### [A Coarse-To-Fine Event-Based Framework for Camera Pose Relocalization with Spatio-Temporal Retrieval and Refinement Network]()

Most existing event-based camera pose relocalization (CPR) learning methods implicitly encode environmental information into network parameters to achieve end-to-end mapping from event stream to pose. However, these end-to-end CPR methods fail to utilize prior environmental information effectively. As the scale of the environment increases, the difficulty of this mapping relationship grows significantly, reducing the robustness of the end-to-end methods across different scenarios. To address the above issues, this paper proposes the first coarse-to-fine event-based CPR framework, which achieves a new paradigm from end-to-end pose regression network to a hierarchical approach. In the coarse localization stage, we effectively encode similarity features by incorporating the fine-grained temporal information, achieving accurate retrieval of nearby event stream. In the pose refinement stage, we present an Event Spatio-temporal Pose Refinement Network (ESPR-Net) based on the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) architecture, which is capable of learning more nuanced spatio-temporal features to achieve accurate regression of the relative pose. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison on the IJRR and M3ED dataset, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both. Notably, our method attains a significant 83% performance improvement on the outdoor M3ED dataset.

### [Digital Beamforming Enhanced Radar Odometry]()

Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in challenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip millimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention thanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low hardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems using traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer from limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the performance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing pipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it to 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal processing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically focus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring odometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems. This research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving more accurate radar odometry by simply replacing the standard FFT-based processing with the proposed pipeline. The codes are available at GitHub.

### [Fast Global Localization on Neural Radiance Field]()

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) presented a novel way to represent scenes, allowing for high-quality 3D reconstruction from 2D images. Following its remarkable achievements, global localization within NeRF maps is an essential task for enabling a wide range of applications. Recently, Loc-NeRF demonstrated a localization approach that combines traditional Monte Carlo Localization with NeRF, showing promising results for using NeRF as an environment map. However, despite its advancements, Loc-NeRF encounters the challenge of a time-intensive ray rendering process, which can be a significant limitation in practical applications. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Loc-NeRF,	which enhances efficiency and accuracy in NeRF map-based global localization. We propose a particle rejection weighting strategy that estimates the uncertainty of particles by leveraging NeRF’s inherent characteristics and incorporates them into the particle weighting process to reject abnormal particles. Additionally, Fast Loc-NeRF employs a coarse-to-fine approach, matching rendered pixels and observed images across multiple resolutions from low to high. As a result, it speeds up the costly particle update process while enhancing precise localization results. Our Fast Loc-NeRF establishes new state-of-the-art localization performance on several benchmarks, demonstrating both its accuracy and efficiency.

### [Continuous-Time Radar-Inertial and Lidar-Inertial Odometry Using a Gaussian Process Motion Prior]()

In this work, we demonstrate continuous-time radar-inertial and lidar-inertial odometry using a Gaussian process motion prior. Using a sparse prior, we demonstrate improved computational complexity during preintegration and interpolation. We use a white-noise-on-acceleration motion prior and treat the gyroscope as a direct measurement of the state while preintegrating accelerometer measurements to form relative velocity factors. Our odometry is implemented using sliding-window batch trajectory estimation. To our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate radar-inertial odometry with a spinning mechanical radar using both gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. We improve the performance of our radar odometry by 43% by incorporating an IMU. Our approach is efficient and we demonstrate real-time performance. Code for this paper can be found at: github.com/utiasASRL/steam_icp

### [NV-LIOM: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry and Mapping Using Normal Vectors towards Robust SLAM in Multifloor Environments]()

Over the last few decades, numerous LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) algorithms have been developed, demonstrating satisfactory performance across diverse environments. Most of these algorithms have predominantly been validated in open outdoor environments; however, they often encounter challenges in confined indoor settings. In such indoor environments, reliable point cloud registration becomes problematic due to the rapid changes in LiDAR scans and repetitive structural features like walls and stairs, particularly in multifloor buildings. In this paper, we present NV-LIOM, a normal vector-based LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping framework focused on robust point cloud registration designed for indoor multifloor environments. Our approach extracts the normal vectors from the LiDAR scans and utilizes them for correspondence search to enhance the point cloud registration performance. To ensure robust registration, the distribution of the normal vector directions is analyzed, and situations of degeneracy are examined to adjust the matching uncertainty. Additionally, a viewpoint-based loop closure module is implemented to avoid wrong correspondences that are blocked by the walls. The proposed method is tested through public datasets and our own dataset. To contribute to the community, the code will be made public on https://github.com/dhchung/nv_liom.

### [SALSA: Swift Adaptive Lightweight Self-Attention for Enhanced LiDAR Place Recognition]()

Large-scale LiDAR mappings and localization leverage place recognition techniques to mitigate odometry drifts, ensuring accurate mapping. These techniques utilize scene representations from LiDAR point clouds to identify previously visited sites within a database. Local descriptors, assigned to each point within a point cloud, are aggregated to form a scene representation for the point cloud. These descriptors are also used to re-rank the retrieved point clouds based on geometric fitness scores. We propose SALSA, a novel, lightweight, and efficient framework for LiDAR place recognition. It consists of a Sphereformer backbone that uses radial window attention to enable information aggregation for sparse distant points, an adaptive self-attention layer to pool local descriptors into tokens, and a multi-layer-perceptron Mixer layer for aggregating the tokens to generate a scene descriptor. The proposed framework outperforms existing methods on various LiDAR place recognition datasets in terms of both retrieval and metric localization while operating in real-time.

### [HeRCULES: Heterogeneous Radar Dataset in Complex Urban Environment for Multi-Session Radar SLAM]()

Recently, radars have been widely featured in robotics for their robustness in challenging weather conditions. Two commonly used radar types are spinning radars and phased-array radars, each offering distinct sensor characteristics. Existing datasets typically feature only a single type of radar, leading to the development of algorithms limited to that specific kind. In this work, we highlight that combining different radar types offers complementary advantages, which can be leveraged through a heterogeneous radar dataset. Moreover, this new dataset fosters research in multi-session and multi-robot scenarios where robots are equipped with different types of radars. In this context, we introduce the HeRCULES dataset, a comprehensive, multi-modal dataset with heterogeneous radars, FMCW LiDAR, IMU, GPS, and cameras. This is the first dataset to integrate 4D radar and spinning radar alongside FMCW LiDAR, offering unparalleled localization, mapping, and place recognition capabilities. The dataset covers diverse weather and lighting conditions and a range of urban traffic scenarios, enabling a comprehensive analysis across various environments. The sequence paths with multiple revisits and ground truth pose for each sensor enhance its suitability for place recognition research. We expect the HeRCULES dataset to facilitate odometry, mapping, place recognition, and sensor fusion research. The dataset and development tools are available at https://sites.google.com/view/herculesdataset.

### [NYC-Event-VPR: A Large-Scale High-Resolution Event-Based Visual Place Recognition Dataset in Dense Urban Environments]()

Visual place recognition (VPR) enables autonomous robots to identify previously visited locations, which contributes to tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in μs), and high dynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.

### [ZeroSCD: Zero-Shot Street Scene Change Detection]()

Scene Change Detection is a challenging task in computer vision and robotics that aims to identify differences between two images of the same scene captured at different times. Traditional change detection methods rely on training models that take these image pairs as input and estimate the changes, which requires large amounts of annotated data, a costly and time-consuming process. To overcome this, we propose ZeroSCD, a zero-shot scene change detection framework that eliminates the need for training. ZeroSCD leverages pre-existing models for place recognition and semantic segmentation, utilizing their features and outputs to perform change detection. In this framework, features extracted from the place recognition model are used to estimate correspondences and detect changes between the two images. These are then combined with segmentation results from the semantic segmentation model to precisely delineate the boundaries of the detected changes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ZeroSCD outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection accuracy, despite not being trained on any of the benchmark datasets, proving its effectiveness and adaptability across different scenarios.

### [SPR: Single-Scan Radar Place Recognition]()

Localization is a crucial component for the navigation of autonomous vehicles. It encompasses global localization and place recognition, allowing a system to identify locations that have been mapped or visited before. Place recognition is commonly approached using cameras or LiDARs. However, these sensors are affected by bad weather or low lighting conditions. In this paper, we exploit automotive radars to address the problem of localizing a vehicle within a map using single radar scans. The effectiveness of radars is not dependent on environmental conditions, and they provide additional information not present in LiDARs such as Doppler velocity and radar cross section. However, the sparse and noisy radar measurement makes place recognition a challenge. Recent research in automotive radars addresses the sensor's limitations by aggregating multiple radar scans and using high-dimensional scene representations. We, in contrast, propose a novel neural network architecture that focuses on each point of single radar scans, without relying on an additional odometry input for scan aggregation. We extract pointwise local and global features, resulting in a compact scene descriptor vector. Our model improves local feature extraction by estimating the importance of each point for place recognition and enhances the global descriptor by leveraging the radar cross section information provided by the sensor. We evaluate our model using nuScenes and the 4DRadarDataset, which involve 2D and 3D automotive radar sensors. Our findings illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for single-scan place recognition using automotive radars.

### [Improving Visual Place Recognition Based Robot Navigation by Verifying Localization Estimates]()

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems often have imperfect performance, affecting the `integrity' of position estimates and subsequent robot navigation decisions. Previously, SVM classifiers have been used to monitor VPR integrity. This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, presenting two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: a single-query rejection method for robot navigation to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a history-of-queries method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ≈9.8m to ≈3.1m, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ≈41% to ≈55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ≈2.0m to ≈0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate localization precision from ≈97% to ≈99%. Overall, our results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a VPR integrity monitor in real-world robotics to improve VPR localization and consequent navigation performance.

### [Shared Control for Cable Routing with Tactile Sensing]()

Multi-stage deformable linear object manipulation, such as cable routing, is the common and necessary part of human life and industry. However, autonomous robots still lack the dexterity and generalization required for these complex tasks. Direct teleoperation is an alternative approach, but the absence of reliable force and haptic feedback methods undermines its robustness and efficiency. This paper proposes a shared control method based on tactile sensing to address a multi-stage, contact-rich cable routing task. The proposed method allows human and robotic autonomy to share control of the robot platform. An action primitive vocabulary is constructed, incorporating adaptive authority allocation between human and autonomy, to generate motions for specific task stages. These allocations modulate the control weights of human and autonomy in accordance with the requirements of task stages. The method selects primitives from this vocabulary based on the tactile data and human intention. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a task involving straightening a cable and slotting it into a clip. We compare its performance with alternative methods and present that our method has a higher success rate and takes less time than direct teleoperation.

### [Whisker-Based Active Tactile Perception for Contour Reconstruction]()

Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces of three different objects.

### [CDM: Contact Diffusion Model for Multi-Contact Point Localization]()

In this paper, we propose a Contact Diffusion Model (CDM), a novel learning-based approach for multi-contact point localization. We consider a robot equipped with joint torque sensors and a force/torque sensor at the base. By leveraging a diffusion model, CDM addresses the singularity where multiple pairs of contact points and forces produce identical sensor measurements. We formulate CDM to be conditioned on past model outputs to account for the time-dependent characteristics of the multi-contact scenarios. Moreover, to effectively address the complex shape of the robot surfaces, we incorporate the signed distance field in the denoising process. Consequently, CDM can localize contacts at arbitrary locations with high accuracy. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, CDM operates at 15.97ms and, in the real world, achieves an error of 0.44cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24cm in dual-contact scenarios.

### [Force Admittance Control of an Underactuated Gripper with Full-State Feedback]()

We present admittance control and fingertip contact detection with a linkage gripper remotely driven by a pneumatic rolling diaphragm actuator. The gripper is driven by underactuated mechanisms sensorized by joint encoders in order to fully determine the gripper state. We present the modelling of the linkage and fluidic transmission, validate its ability to regulate pinch force within an RMS error well under 0.5 Newtons via admittance control, and show the ability to detect contact at targeted locations on the linkage. In addition, we demonstrate simple grasping behaviors: blindly searching for an unobstructed object and detecting object loss. Our results show that an integrative approach of instrumenting underactuated gripper mechanisms can result in a lightweight gripper that is not only mechanically adaptive but sensitive enough to react to contact events without distal sensors or vision.

### [GenTact Toolbox: A Computational Design Pipeline to Procedurally Generate Context-Driven 3D Printed Whole-Body Artificial Skins]()

Developing whole-body tactile skins for robots remains a challenging task, as existing solutions often prioritize modular, one-size-fits-all designs, which, while versatile, fail to account for the robot’s specific shape and the unique demands of its operational context. In this work, we introduce GenTact Toolbox, a computational pipeline for creating versatile whole-body tactile skins tailored to both robot shape and application domain. Our method includes procedural mesh generation for conforming to a robot’s topology, task-driven simulation to refine sensor distribution, and multi-material 3D printing for shape-agnostic fabrication. We validate our approach by creating and deploying six capacitive sensing skins on a Franka Research 3 robot arm in a human-robot interaction scenario. This work represents a shift from “one-size-fits-all” tactile sensors toward context-driven, highly adaptable designs that can be customized for a wide range of robotic systems and applications. The project website is available at https://hiro-group.ronc.one/gentacttoolbox

### [Human-Robot Collaborative Cable-Suspended Manipulation with Contact Distinction]()

The collaborative transportation of objects between humans and robots is a fundamental task in physical human-robot interaction. Most of the literature considers the rigid co-grasping of non-deformable items in which both the human and the robot directly hold the transported object with their hands. In this paper, we implement a control strategy for the collaborative manipulation of a cable-suspended platform. The latter is an articulated and partially deformable object that can be used as a base where to place the transported object. In this way, the human and the robot are not rigidly coupled, ensuring a greater flexibility in the partners' motions and a safer interaction. However, the uncertain dynamics of the platform introduces a greater possibility of unintended collisions with external objects, which must be distinguished from contacts arising when a load is placed on or removed from the platform. This paper proposes a contact detection and distinction strategy to address this challenge. The proposed cable-suspended manipulation framework is based only on force sensing at the robot end-effector, and was tested with ten users.

### [Interactive Motion Planning for a 7-DOF Robot]()

The use of robots in high-risk and extreme environments is crucial for tasks that are dangerous or inaccessible to humans and require high precision. Particularly in scenarios where the cost of failure is high, remote human teleoperation can be the preferred method of robot control due to the adaptability and high-level decision making of humans. Teleoperation brings many challenges including lack of accurate prior knowledge about the environment, limited views of the environment by on-board sensors, and especially inconsistent latency. 7-DOF (degrees of freedom) manipulators provide redundancy which can be utilized for increased flexibility in manipulation, and may be preferred to 6-DOF manipulators in many scenarios. The redundancy, however, must be considered by the teleoperation system. We present an extension to an existing Interactive Planning and Supervised Execution (IPSE) system that enables full teleoperation of a 7-DOF robot by encoding the redundant degree of freedom with a Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, which is user-manipulable via an SEW angle graph. Additionally, we introduce a novel user interface feature that encodes robot state information into a 2D image which is displayed directly on the SEW angle graph. We conduct a user-study which demonstrates that the addition of this SEW graph significantly reduces task completion time.

### [A Hybrid User Interface Combining AR, Desktop, and Mobile Interfaces for Enhanced Industrial Robot Programming]()

Robot programming for complex assembly tasks is challenging and demands expert knowledge. With Augmented Reality (AR), immersive 3D visualization can be placed in the robot’s intrinsic coordinate system to support robot programming. However, AR interfaces introduce usability challenges. To address these, we introduce a hybrid user interface (HUI) that combines a 2D desktop, a smartphone, and an AR head-mounted display (HMD) application, enabling operators to choose the most suitable device for each sub-task. The evaluation with an expert user study shows that an HUI can enhance efficiency and user experience by selecting the appropriate device for each sub-task. Generally, the HMD is preferred for tasks involving 3D content, the desktop for creating the program structure and parametrization, and the smartphone for mobile parametrization. However, the device selection depends on individual user characteristics and their familiarity with the devices.

### [Enhancing AR-To-Robot Registration Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Marker Detection Algorithms and Registration Parameters]()

Augmented Reality (AR) offers potential for enhancing human-robot collaboration by enabling intuitive interaction and real-time feedback. A crucial aspect of AR-robot integration is accurate spatial registration to align virtual content with the physical robotic workspace. This paper systematically investigates the effects of different tracking techniques and registration parameters on AR-to-robot registration accuracy, focusing on paired-point methods. We evaluate four marker detection algorithms - ARToolkit, Vuforia, ArUco, and retroreflective tracking - analyzing the influence of viewing distance, angle, marker size, point distance, distribution, and quantity. Our results show that ARToolkit provides the highest registration accuracy. While larger markers and positioning registration point centroids close to target locations consistently improved accuracy, other factors such as point distance and quantity were highly dependent on the tracking techniques used. Additionally, we propose an effective refinement method using point cloud registration, significantly improving accuracy by integrating data from points recorded between registration locations. These findings offer practical guidelines for enhancing AR-robot registration, with future work needed to assess the transferability to other AR devices and robots.

### [Sketch-MoMa: Teleoperation for Mobile Manipulator Via Interpretation of Hand-Drawn Sketches]()

To use assistive robots in everyday life, a remote control system with common devices, such as 2D devices, is helpful to control the robots anytime and anywhere as intended. Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different intentions from scene to scene, existing work requires additional modalities to set the sketches’ semantics. This requires complex operations for users and leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a teleoperation system using user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize sketches and the generated shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate that our approach effectively specifies more detailed intentions, such as how to grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment with 14 participants.

### [Closed-Loop Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation with GPT-4V]()

Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. In this work, we present COME-robot, the first closed-loop robotic system utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios. COME-robot incorporates two key innovative modules: (i) a multi-level open-vocabulary perception and situated reasoning module that enables effective exploration of the 3D environment and target object identification using commonsense knowledge and situated information, and (ii) an iterative closed-loop feedback and restoration mechanism that verifies task feasibility, monitors execution success, and traces failure causes across different modules for robust failure recovery. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world mobile and tabletop manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~25%) compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.

### [Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control]()

Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n=30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming. Video available at https://youtu.be/83kWr8zUFIQ.

### [MJPR: Multi-Modal Joint Predictive Representation in Deep Reinforcement Learning]()

Multi-modal reinforcement learning (RL) has been brought into focus due to its ability to provide complementary information from different sensors, enriching observations of agents. However, the introduction of multi-modal high-dimensional observations brings challenges to sample efficiency. There is a lack of research on how to efficiently obtain multi-modal latent states while encouraging them to generate complementary information. To address this, we propose a representation learning method, Multi-modal Joint Predictive Representation (MJPR), which utilizes multi-modal interactive information to predict future latent states. The joint prediction method achieves the representation training for modalities and promotes each modality to generate complementary information related to predictions of each other. In addition, we introduce multi-modal loss balancing to prompt training equilibrium and cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) to align the modalities for effective modal interaction. We establish the multi-modal environments in the Deepmind Control suite (DMC) and Webots and compare our method with current RL representation methods. Experimental results show that MJPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 12.0% on six subtasks in DMC environments. It outperforms advanced methods by 16.7% and 55.4% in simple tasks and complex tasks of Webots environment, respectively. Moreover, ablation experiments are established in the DMC environment to verify the importance of each module to MJPR.

### [FLEX: A Framework for Learning Robot-Agnostic Force-Based Skills Involving Sustained Contact Object Manipulation]()

Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving sustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g., drawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in textit{force space}, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics—such as joint configurations—allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting. Link: url{https://tufts-ai-robotics-group.github.io/FLEX/}

### [FLoRA: Sample-Efficient Preference-Based RL Via Low-Rank Style Adaptation of Reward Functions]()

Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) is a suitable approach for style adaptation of pre-trained robotic behavior: adapting the robot's policy to follow human user preferences while still being able to perform the original task. However, collecting preferences for the adaptation process in robotics is often challenging and time-consuming. In this work we explore the adaptation of pre-trained robots in the low-preference-data regime. We show that, in this regime, recent adaptation approaches suffer from catastrophic reward forgetting (CRF), where the updated reward model overfits to the new preferences, leading the agent to become unable to perform the original task. To mitigate CRF, we propose to enhance the original reward model with a small number of parameters (low-rank matrices) responsible for modeling the preference adaptation. Our evaluation shows that our method can efficiently and effectively adjust robotic behavior to human preferences across simulation benchmark tasks and multiple real-world robotic tasks. We provide videos of our results and source code at https://sites.google.com/view/preflora/.

### [On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards]()

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose Goal-Contrastive Rewards (GCR), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task.

### [Watch Less, Feel More: Sim-To-Real RL for Generalizable Articulated Object Manipulation Via Motion Adaptation and Impedance Control]()

Articulated object manipulation poses a unique challenge compared to rigid object manipulation as the object itself represents a dynamic environment. In this work, we present a novel RL-based pipeline equipped with variable impedance control and motion adaptation leveraging observation history for generalizable articulated object manipulation, focusing on smooth and dexterous motion during zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. To mitigate the sim-to-real gap, our pipeline diminishes reliance on vision by not leveraging the vision data feature (RGBD/pointcloud) directly as policy input but rather extracting useful low-dimensional data first via off-the-shelf modules. Additionally, we experience less sim-to-real gap by inferring object motion and its intrinsic properties via observation history as well as utilizing impedance control both in the simulation and in the real world. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed training setting with great randomization and a specialized reward system (task-aware and motion-aware) that enables multi-staged, end-to-end manipulation without heuristic motion planning. To the best of our knowledge, our policy is the first to report 84% success rate in the real world via extensive experiments with various unseen objects.

### [From Imitation to Refinement -- Residual RL for Precise Assembly]()

Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have made it easy to teach robots new tasks. However, we find that the ease of teaching comes at the cost of unreliable performance that saturates with increasing data for tasks requiring precision. The performance saturation can be attributed to two critical factors: (a) distribution shift resulting from the use of offline data and (b) the lack of closed-loop corrective control caused by action chucking (predicting a set of future actions executed open-loop) critical for BC performance. Our key insight is that by predicting action chunks, BC policies function more like trajectory "planners" than closed-loop controllers necessary for reliable execution. To address these challenges, we devise a simple yet effective method, ResiP (Residual for Precise Manipulation), that overcomes the reliability problem while retaining BC’s ease of teaching and long-horizon capabilities. ResiP augments a frozen, chunked BC model with a fully closed-loop residual policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses distribution shifts and introduces closed-loop corrections over open-loop execution of action chunks predicted by the BC trajectory planner.

### [Fast Policy Synthesis with Variable Noise Diffusion Models]()

Diffusion models have seen rapid adoption in robotic imitation learning, enabling autonomous execution of complex dexterous tasks. However, action synthesis is often slow, requiring many steps of iterative denoising, limiting the extent to which models can be used in tasks that require fast reactive policies. To sidestep this, recent works have explored how the distillation of the diffusion process can be used to accelerate policy synthesis. However, distillation is computationally expensive and can hurt both the accuracy and diversity of synthesized actions. We propose SDP (Streaming Diffusion Policy), an alternative method to accelerate policy synthesis, leveraging the insight that generating a partially denoised action trajectory is substantially faster than a full output action trajectory. At each observation, our approach outputs a partially denoised action trajectory with variable levels of noise corruption , where the immediate action to execute is noise-free, with subsequent actions having increasing levels of noise and uncertainty. The partially denoised action trajectory for a new observation can then be quickly generated by applying a few steps of denoising to the previously predicted noisy action trajectory (rolled over by one timestep). We illustrate the efficacy of this approach, dramatically speeding up policy synthesis while preserving performance across both simulated and real-world settings.

### [Adaptive Compliance Policy: Learning Approximate Compliance for Diffusion Guided Control]()

Compliance plays a crucial role in manipulation, as it balances between the concurrent control of position and force under uncertainties. Yet compliance is often overlooked by today's visuomotor policies that solely focus on position control. This paper introduces Adaptive Compliance Policy (ACP), a novel framework that learns to dynamically adjust system compliance both spatially and temporally for given manipulation tasks from human demonstrations, improving upon previous approaches that rely on pre-selected compliance parameters or assume uniform constant stiffness. However, computing full compliance parameters from human demonstrations is an ill-defined problem. Instead, we estimate an approximate compliance profile with two useful properties: avoiding large contact forces and encouraging accurate tracking. Our approach enables robots to handle complex contact-rich manipulation tasks and achieves over 50% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art visuomotor policy methods.

### [Learning Wheelchair Tennis Navigation from Broadcast Videos with Domain Knowledge Transfer and Diffusion Motion Planning]()

In this paper, we propose a novel and generalizable zero-shot knowledge transfer framework that distills expert sports navigation strategies from web videos into robotic systems with adversarial constraints and out-of-distribution image trajectories. Our pipeline enables diffusion-based imitation learning by reconstructing the full 3D task space from multiple partial views, warping it into 2D image space, closing the planning loop within this 2D space, and transfer constrained motion of interest back to task space. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned policy can serve as a local planner in conjunction with position control. We apply this framework in the wheelchair tennis navigation problem to guide the wheelchair into the ball-hitting region. Our pipeline achieves a navigation success rate of 97.67% in reaching real-world recorded tennis ball trajectories with a physical robot wheelchair, and achieve a success rate of 68.49% in a real-world, real-time experiment on a full-sized tennis court.

### [Diff-DAgger: Uncertainty Estimation with Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation]()

Recently, diffusion policy has shown impressive results in handling multi-modal tasks in robotic manipulation. However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8. We hope that this work opens up a path for efficiently incorporating expressive yet data-hungry policies into interactive robot learning settings.

### [SPOT: SE(3) Pose Trajectory Diffusion for Object-Centric Manipulation]()

We introduce SPOT, an object-centric imitation learning framework. The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

### [Imitation Learning with Limited Actions Via Diffusion Planners and Deep Koopman Controllers]()

Recent advances in diffusion-based robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in imitating multi-modal behaviors. However, these approaches typically require large quantities of demonstration data paired with corresponding robot action labels, creating a substantial data collection burden. In this work, we propose a plan-then-control framework aimed at improving the action-data efficiency of inverse dynamics controllers by leveraging observational demonstration data. Specifically, we adopt a Deep Koopman Operator framework to model the dynamical system and utilize observation-only trajectories to learn a latent action representation. This latent representation can then be effectively mapped to real high-dimensional continuous actions using a linear action decoder, requiring minimal action-labeled data. Through experiments on simulated robot manipulation tasks and a real robot experiment with multi-modal expert demonstrations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances action-data efficiency and achieves high task success rates with limited action data.

### [H3O: Hyper-Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction with Heterogeneous Supervision]()

3D occupancy prediction has recently emerged as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene understanding and provides valuable information for downstream planning in autonomous driving. Most existing methods, however, are computationally expensive, requiring costly attention-based 2D-3D transformation and 3D feature processing. In this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, named H3O, which features highly efficient architecture designs and incurs a significantly lower computational cost as compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, to compensate for the ambiguity in ground-truth 3D occupancy labels, we advocate leveraging auxiliary tasks to complement the direct 3D supervision. In particular, we integrate multi-camera depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and surface normal estimation via differentiable volume rendering, supervised by corresponding 2D labels that introduces rich and heterogeneous supervision signals. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed H3O.

### [TrackOcc: Camera-Based 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking]()

Comprehensive and consistent dynamic scene understanding from camera input is essential for advanced autonomous systems. Traditional camera-based perception tasks like 3D object tracking and semantic occupancy prediction lack either spatial comprehensiveness or temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a brand-new task, Camera-based 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking, which simultaneously addresses panoptic occupancy segmentation and object tracking from camera-only input. Furthermore, we propose TrackOcc, a cutting-edge approach that processes image inputs in a streaming, end-to-end manner with 4D panoptic queries to address the proposed task. Leveraging the localization-aware loss, TrackOcc enhances the accuracy of 4D panoptic occupancy tracking without bells and whistles. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo dataset. The code will be released for future research.

### [OCCUQ: Exploring Efficient Uncertainty Quantification for 3D Occupancy Prediction]()

Autonomous driving has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and provide numerous societal benefits. Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/OCCUQ.

### [LiDAR-BIND: Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion through Shared Latent Embeddings]()

This paper presents LiDAR-BIND, a novel sensor fusion framework aimed at enhancing the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) through a shared latent embedding space. With this method, the addition of different modalities, such as sonar and radar, into existing navigation setups becomes possible. These modalities offer robust performance even in challenging scenarios where optical sensors fail. Leveraging a shared latent representation space, LiDAR-BIND enables accurate modality prediction, allowing for the translation of one sensor's observations into another, thereby overcoming the limitations of depending solely on LiDAR for dense point-cloud generation. Through this, the framework facilitates the alignment of multiple sensor modalities without the need for large synchronized datasets across all sensors. We demonstrate its usability in SLAM applications, outperforming traditional LiDAR-based approaches under degraded optical conditions.

### [Enhancing Autonomous Navigation by Imaging Hidden Objects Using Single-Photon LiDAR]()

Robust autonomous navigation in environments with limited visibility remains a critical challenge in robotics. We present a novel approach that leverages Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) sensing using single-photon LiDAR to improve visibility and enhance autonomous navigation. Our method enables mobile robots to ``see around corners" by utilizing multi-bounce light information, effectively expanding their perceptual range without additional infrastructure. We propose a three-module pipeline: (1) Sensing, which captures multi-bounce histograms using SPAD-based LiDAR; (2) Perception, which estimates occupancy maps of hidden regions from these histograms using a convolutional neural network; and (3) Control, which allows a robot to follow safe paths based on the estimated occupancy. We evaluate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments on a mobile robot navigating an L-shaped corridor with hidden obstacles. Our work represents the first experimental demonstration of NLOS imaging for autonomous navigation, paving the way for safer and more efficient robotic systems operating in complex environments. We also contribute a novel dynamics-integrated transient rendering framework for simulating NLOS scenarios, facilitating future research in this domain.

### [Visual-Based Forklift Learning System Enabling Zero-Shot Sim2Real without Real-World Data]()

Forklifts are used extensively in various industrial settings and are in high demand for automation. In particular, counterbalance forklifts are highly versatile and are employed in diverse scenarios. However, efforts to automate these processes are lacking, primarily owing to the absence of a safe and performance-verifiable development environment. This study proposes a learning system that combines a photorealistic digital learning environment with a 1/14-scale robotic forklift environment to address this challenge. Inspired by the training-based learning approach adopted by forklift operators, we employ an end-to-end vision-based deep reinforcement learning approach. The learning is conducted in a digitalized environment created from CAD data, making it safe and eliminating the need for real-world data. In addition, we safely validate the method in a physical setting using a 1/14-scale robotic forklift with a configuration similar to that of a real forklift. We achieved a 60% success rate in pallet loading tasks in real experiments using a robotic forklift. Our approach demonstrates zero-shot sim2real with a simple method that does not require heuristic additions. This learning-based approach is considered a first step towards the automation of counterbalance forklifts.

### [Strategic System Design for High Precision in Assembly Processes of CPU]()

Robotic picking and placing played an essential role in Industrial 4.0 and have long been recognized as significant contributions to industrial processes. Various scenarios involve picking and placing parts for assembly in industrial production, such as assembling different electronic components in the manufacturing process. Those tasks require high precision to complete. However, achieving high precision in the assembly of CPUs poses a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with reflective surfaces. This paper presents a strategic system design tailored to address these challenges effectively. We focus on system device choice and optimizing the key parameters of the sensor system to strike a balance between device cost and the required precision. We use methods to construct the whole robot manipulation system, such as geometric segmentation, binocular vision with structure light projection and, based on 3D information, 6D pose estimation to construct the system. The results of our study demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of this strategic system design in industrial settings. By meeting strict system accuracy requirements, our approach contributes to advancing industry practices and growing its impact on society.

### [The Influence of Counterbalance System on the Dynamic Characterization of Heavy Industrial Robots]()

The precision of industrial robots is often limited by the relatively low stiffness of their joints, leading to positioning errors influenced by factors such as the mass and inertia of robotic links, external forces, and the counterbalance system (CBS). Counterbalance systems, typically consisting of hydropneumatic cylinders, are designed to reduce motor torque and assist in supporting heavier links. Traditionally, positioning errors in industrial robots have been corrected statically by determining pose-dependent stiffness values. However, recent numerical models incorpórate inertial effects to improve positioning error correction, making accurate inertial parameter identification essential. These parameters are typically unknown and must be determined experimentally. While methodologies for inertial parameter estimation have been extensively studied, none have accounted for the effect of the counterbalance system in this process.To address this gap, a methodology for estimating inertial parameters was applied to a heavy industrial robot, considering the influence of the counterbalance system. A comparative analysis with and without the counterbalance system showed that its inclusion improved joint torque calculation accuracy, showing the necessity of considering it in dynamic parameter characterization methodologies.

### [Deep Learning-Based Friction Compensation in Low Velocity for Enhanced Direct Teaching in Collaborative Manipulators]()

Direct teaching in collaborative manipulators, an essential method for intuitive trajectory control, faces significant challenges due to friction in robot joints. To address this, we present a novel friction compensation framework to improve direct teaching methods for robots. Our approach focuses on mitigating friction in the joints most susceptible to frictional effects, ensuring smoother and more precise motion. The proposed framework uses deep neural networks (DNN) to model the complex friction behavior. This approach circumvents the difficulties associated with traditional friction compensation model selection. We develop specific data input preprocessing algorithms that optimize friction estimation when paired with standard encoders commonly used in collaborative robots. In addition, our custom loss function is specifically designed to improve DNN training in these low-velocity regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies assessing the impact of two critical components: the preprocessing algorithms and the custom loss function. These studies provide insight into the contributions of each element to overall performance. Experimental validation using two 6-DoF collaborative robots demonstrates the practical applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

### [Fixture-Free 2D Sewing Using a Dual-Arm Manipulator System (I)]()

We propose a fixture-free 2D sewing system using a dual-arm manipulator, i.e., the seam lines of the top and bottom fabric parts are the same. The proposed 2D sewing system sews two stacked fabric parts together along a desired seam line printed on the top fabric part without the use of a fixture. In the proposed system, the set of aligned and stacked fabric parts is held by the end-effectors of the dual-arm manipulator in coordination. The dual-arm manipulator controls the motion of the fabric parts on the flat sewing table stitch by stitch in coordination, while keeping the manipulated fabric parts flat using the internal force applied to the set of fabric parts. A novel vision-based seam line tracking control is proposed to control the motion of the set of fabric parts along the printed seam line on the top fabric part. The convergence of the tracking error is analyzed for sewing along both straight and curved seam lines and is shown to be specified by the control parameters. Sewing experiments show that the tracking error converges to zero as analyzed. The sewing experiments also show that the newly proposed trajectory generation method, which synchronizes the coordinated motion of the manipulators and the motion of the sewing needle, is essential for achieving accurate sewing.

### [Improving the Collision Tolerance of High-Speed Industrial Robots Via Impact-Aware Path Planning and Series Clutched Actuation]()

Robots are more often deployed in unstructured or unpredictable environments. Particularly collisions at high speed can severely damage the drivetrains and joint bearings of robots. In order to avoid such collisions, path planners exist that adapt the robot’s original trajectory online if a collision hazard is detected. These methods require additional sensors such as cameras, are computationally costly and never flawless due to occlusions. Another approach is to incorporate a cost function that promotes collision tolerance while planning the initial trajectory. The resulting impact-aware path plan minimizes the chance of robot hardware damage if a collision would occur. Two algorithms are presented to assess collision tolerance in high-speed robots, taking into account factors such as robot pose, impact direction, and maximum intermittent loading of the gearboxes and bearings. The first algorithm is more general while the second assumes the presence of joint overload clutches that decouple upon impact. These algorithms are applied to plan an impact-aware path for a custom 6-axis series clutched actuated robot that serves as use case.

### [Full-Order Sampling-Based MPC for Torque-Level Locomotion Control Via Diffusion-Style Annealing]()

Due to high dimensionality and non-convexity, real-time optimal control using full-order dynamics models for legged robots is challenging.	Therefore, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approaches are often limited to reduced-order models. Sampling-based MPC has shown potential in nonconvex even discontinuous problems, but often yields suboptimal solutions with high variance, which limits its applications in high-dimensional locomotion. This work introduces DIAL-MPC (Diffusion-Inspired Annealing for Legged MPC), a sampling-based MPC framework with a novel diffusion-style annealing process. Such an annealing process is supported by the theoretical landscape analysis of Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) and the connection between MPPI and single-step diffusion. Algorithmically, DIAL-MPC iteratively refines solutions online and achieves both global coverage and local convergence. In quadrupedal torque-level control tasks, DIAL-MPC reduces the tracking error of standard MPPI by 13.4 times and outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) policies by 50% in challenging climbing tasks without any training. In particular, DIAL-MPC enables precise real-world quadrupedal jumping with payload. To the best of our knowledge, DIAL-MPC is the first training-free method that optimizes over full-order quadruped dynamics in real-time.

### [D(R, O) Grasp: A Unified Representation of Robot and Object Interaction for Cross-Embodiment Dexterous Grasping]()

Dexterous grasping is a fundamental yet challenging skill in robotic manipulation, requiring precise interaction between robotic hands and objects. In this paper, we present D(R,O) Grasp, a novel framework that models the interaction between the robotic hand in its grasping pose and the object, enabling broad generalization across various robot hands and object geometries. Our model takes the robot hand's description and object point cloud as inputs and efficiently predicts kinematically valid and stable grasps, demonstrating strong adaptability to diverse robot embodiments and object geometries. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant improvements in success rate, grasp diversity, and inference speed across multiple robotic hands. Our method achieves an average success rate of 87.53% in simulation in less than one second, tested across three different dexterous robotic hands. In real-world experiments using the LeapHand, the method also demonstrates an average success rate of 89%. D(R,O) Grasp provides a robust solution for dexterous grasping in complex and varied environments. The code, appendix, and videos are available on our project website at https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/drograspweb/.

### [TrofyBot: A Transformable Rolling and Flying Robot with High Energy Efficiency]()

Terrestrial and aerial bimodal vehicles have gained significant interest due to their energy efficiency and versatile maneuverability across different domains. However, most existing passive-wheeled bimodal vehicles rely on attitude regulation to generate forward thrust, which inevitably results in energy waste on producing lifting force. In this work, we propose a novel passive-wheeled bimodal vehicle called TrofyBot that can rapidly change the thrust direction with a single servo motor and a transformable parallelogram linkage mechanism (TPLM). Cooperating with a bidirectional force generation module (BFGM) for motors to produce bidirectional thrust, the robot achieves flexible mobility as a differential driven rover on the ground. This design achieves 95.37% energy saving efficiency in terrestrial locomotion, allowing the robot continuously move on the ground for more than two hours in current setup. Furthermore, the design obviates the need for attitude regulation and therefore provides a stable sensor field of view (FoV). We model the bimodal dynamics for the system, analyze its differential flatness property, and design a controller based on hybrid model predictive control for trajectory tracking. A prototype is built and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the design and the proposed controller, which achieves high energy efficiency and seamless transition between modes.

### [Geometric Design and Gait Co-Optimization for Soft Continuum Robots Swimming at Low and High Reynolds Numbers]()

Recent advancements in soft actuators have enabled soft continuum swimming robots to achieve higher efficiency and more closely mimic the behaviors of real marine animals. However, optimizing the design and control of these soft continuum robots remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a practical framework for the co-optimization of the design and control of soft continuum robots, approached from a geometric locomotion analysis perspective. This framework is based on the principles of geometric mechanics, accounting for swimming at both low and high Reynolds numbers. By generalizing geometric principles to continuum bodies, we achieve efficient geometric variational co-optimization of designs and gaits across different power consumption metrics and swimming environments. The resulting optimal designs and gaits exhibit greater efficiencies at both low and high Reynolds numbers compared to three-link or serpenoid swimmers with the same degrees of freedom, approaching or even surpassing the efficiencies of infinitely flexible swimmers and those with higher degrees of freedom.

### [ShadowTac: Dense Measurement of Shear and Normal Deformation of a Tactile Membrane from Colored Shadows]()

To robustly handle objects, robots must perceive mechanical interactions through touch with sufficient richness. New tactile sensors leverage miniature cameras to provide dense measurements of these interactions, allowing for the extraction of material properties and frictional information. Among the plethora of solutions, retrographic sensing is popular for its ability to finely resolve the shape of the object being touched. This sensor uses a reflective membrane, illuminated at a shallow angle by three RGB lights, which cast colored shadows. From the illumination pattern of the deformed membrane, both the normal deformation and fine surface details can be recovered. However, these retrographic sensors cannot detect the lateral displacement of the membrane and, therefore, overlook frictional information, which is crucial for grasping and manipulation. Embedding and tracking opaque markers has been a makeshift solution, but these markers occlude the membrane and are difficult to manufacture. In this paper, we introduce ShadowTac, a tactile sensor that combines retrographic illumination with non-intrusive markers created by colored shadows. We patterned the retrographic surface with a dense array of submillimeter dimples, which are small enough not to obstruct the view yet cast shadows large enough to be visible to the camera. ShadowTac captures a dense image of both the normal displacement field with fine details and a precise lateral displacement field by tracking the markers. Additionally, our sensor is easy to manufacture, as the dimple pattern can simply be molded. We evaluated the measurement reliability of ShadowTac and its effectiveness in estimating the incipient slip of arbitrary objects. The dense measurement of both the normal and shear deformation that the sensor captures makes it ideal for tracking dynamic interactions between robotic fingertips and manipulated objects.

### [Occlusion-Aware 6D Pose Estimation with Depth-Guided Graph Encoding and Cross-Semantic Fusion for Robotic Grasping]()

Reliable 6D pose estimation is crucial for robotic tasks but presents significant challenges in environments with occlusion. Recent approaches tend to directly predict pose parameters of object with deep neural networks, lacking the modeling ability of non-adjacent and complex relationships of surface points in occluded scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose a novel occlusion-aware 6D pose estimation framework, which uses depth-guided graph neural network (GNN) to model potential relationships from RGBD input. Two semantic information, which are mask and binary code of object, are adaptively fused to extract 2D-3D correspondence related features in an effective manner. Both enhanced graph features and fused semantic information contribute to the performance improvement of pose estimation with occlusion. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach outperforms comparative methods by 1.2% and 1.9% on LMO and YCBV datasets (up to 30% for certain objects) and its validity is also verified under real-world pose estimation test.

### [JPG-SLAM: Joint Point-Gaussian Splatting Representation for Dense Dynamic SLAM]()

This paper presents a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to provide accurate pose estimation and dynamic scene reconstruction. Our approach proposes a Joint Point-Gaussian Splatting representation, which fully integrates the robustness of isotropic feature points in pose estimation and the flexibility of anisotropic 3D Gaussians in scene representation. This system does not need to suppress the anisotropic representation of Gaussian elements, which enables the mapping module to achieve finer scene representation with lower memory consumption. Additionally, in order to enhance the adaptability of the system in dynamic environments, we introduced a dynamic region recognition module and utilized 3D Gaussian Splatting and 4D Gaussian Splatting representations to represent static and dynamic regions respectively. Furthermore, we developed a local map management strategy for Gaussian Splatting mapping, effectively reducing the memory and computational resource usage in the mapping process. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy compared to existing baselines.

### [FMCW-LIO: A Doppler LiDAR-Inertial Odometry]()

Conventional LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) or SLAM methods heavily rely on geometric features of environments, as LiDARs primarily provide range measurements instead of motion measurements. From now on, however, the situation changes thanks to the novel Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDARs. FMCW LiDARs not only offer the point range with high resolution but also capture the instant point Doppler velocity through the Doppler effect. In the letter, we propose FMCW-LIO, a novel and robust LIO, leveraging intrinsic Doppler measurements from FMCW LiDARs. To correctly exploit Doppler velocities, a motion compensation method is designed, and a Doppler-aided observation model is applied for on-manifold state estimation. Then, dynamic points can be effectively removed by the Doppler criteria, deriving more consistent geometric observations. FMCW-LIO eventually achieves accurate state estimation and static mapping, even in structure-degenerated environments. Extensive experiments in diverse scenes are performed and FMCW-LIO outperforms other algorithms on both accuracy and robustness.

### [Submodular Optimization for Keyframe Selection & Usage in SLAM]()

Keyframes are LiDAR scans saved for future reference in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), but despite their central importance most algorithms leave choices of which scans to save and how to use them to wasteful heuristics. This work proposes two novel keyframe selection strategies for localization and map summarization, as well as a novel approach to submap generation which selects keyframes that best constrain localization. Our results show that online keyframe identification and submap generation reduce the number of saved keyframes and improve per scan computation time without compromising localization performance. We also present a map summarization feature for quickly capturing environments under strict map size constraints.

### [Equivariant Filter Design for Range-Only SLAM]()

Range-only Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (RO-SLAM) is of interest in the robotics community due to its practical applications; for example, ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation in terrestrial and aerial applications and acoustic beacon localisation in marine applications. In this work, we consider a mobile robot equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a range sensor that measures distances to a collection of fixed landmarks. We derive an equivariant filter (EqF) for the RO-SLAM problem based on a symmetry Lie group that is compatible with the range measurements. The proposed filter does not require bootstrapping or initialisation of landmark positions, and demonstrates robustness to the no-prior situation. The filter is demonstrated on a real-world dataset, and it is shown to significantly outperform a state-of-the-art EKF alternative in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

### [Toward Globally Optimal State Estimation Using Automatically Tightened Semidefinite Relaxations]()

In recent years, semidefinite relaxations of common optimization problems in robotics have attracted growing attention due to their ability to provide globally optimal solutions. In many cases, it was shown that specific handcrafted redundant constraints are required to obtain tight relaxations, and thus global optimality. These constraints are formulation-dependent and typically identified through a lengthy manual process. Instead, the present article suggests an automatic method to find a set of sufficient redundant constraints to obtain tightness, if they exist. We first propose an efficient feasibility check to determine if a given set of variables can lead to a tight formulation. Second, we show how to scale the method to problems of bigger size. At no point of the process do we have to find redundant constraints manually. We showcase the effectiveness of the approach, in simulation and on real datasets, for range-based localization and stereo-based pose estimation. We also reproduce semidefinite relaxations presented in recent literature and show that our automatic method always finds a smaller set of constraints sufficient for tightness than previously considered.

### [Viewpoint-Aware Visibility Scoring for Point Cloud Registration in Loop Closure]()

Abstract—Lidar-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) encounters a substantial challenge in the form of accumulating errors, which can adversely impact its reliability. Loop closing techniques have been extensively employed to counteract this issue. Nonetheless, the loop closing conundrum remains difficult to resolve, as point clouds often exhibit partial overlap due to disparities in scanning pose (viewpoints). This renders the conventional point cloud registration such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm problematic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a two-stage viewpoint-aware point cloud registration technique that assigns suitable weights to the correspondence pairs associating two point clouds from different viewpoints. The weights account for the visibility of points from their respective viewpoint as well as from the viewpoint of the counterpart point cloud, making the registration more relying on commonly visible points from the both viewpoints. Experimental results, utilizing the KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay dataset, indicate that the proposed technique delivers more precise and robust performance compared to the baseline techniques.

### [Tension Dependent Twisted String Actuator Modelling and Efficacy Benchmarking in Force and Impedance Control]()

This study presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of Twisted String Actuators (TSA), focused on enhancing contraction modelling accuracy and establishing a baseline for TSA tension and impedance control efficacy. A novel TSA string radius function is introduced, computing effective radii for multi-strand bundles based on axial actuator tension. The proposed model was validated in physical experiments, resulting in a reduction of maximal errors between measured and simulated actuator contraction trajectories from up to 60% in established models to around 10% in our work. Additionally, the tension-dependent radius modification effectively reduced errors between the estimated and the measured bundle tension by an order of magnitude, marking an essential step towards TSA control independent of bundle tension measurements. TSA tension control was assessed based on four metrics: accuracy, precision, impact stability, and bandwidth, following ISO 9283:1998 standards. The quality of tension control was found to be dependent on bundle tension, twisting angle and strand quantity, whereas impact stability was maintained in all configurations. Joint impedance control with TSA was evaluated for perturbation stability and position control bandwidth, where the latter was enhanced with increasing joint stiffness. The presented analysis informs designers about the capabilities of TSAs in different configurations, and their respective suitability for desired applications.

### [A Novel Twisted-Winching String Actuator for Robotic Applications: Design and Validation]()

This paper presents a novel actuator system combining a twisted string actuator (TSA) with a winch mechanism. Relative to traditional hydraulic and pneumatic systems in robotics, TSAs are compact and lightweight but face limitations in stroke length and force-transmission ratios. Our integrated TSA-winch system overcomes these constraints by providing variable transmission ratios through dynamic adjustment. It increases actuator stroke by winching instead of overtwisting, and it improves force output by twisting. The design features a rotating turret that houses a winch, which is mounted on a bevel gear assembly driven by a through-hole drive shaft. Mathematical models are developed for the combined displacement and velocity control of this system. Experimental validation demonstrates the actuator's ability to achieve a wide range of transmission ratios and precise movement control. We present performance data on movement precision and generated forces, discussing the results in the context of existing literature. This research contributes to the development of more versatile and efficient actuation systems for advanced robotic applications and improved automation solutions.

### [Design and Evaluation of High-Performance Motion-Decoupled Cable Transmission Modules]()

Cable transmissions are commonly used in robotics for remote force transmission, offering a lightweight, compact, and efficient solution for transmitting high forces between input and output. However, cables in flexible compression housings (Bowden cables), exhibit high static friction, which increases exponentially with total bend angle. Alternatively, internally routed ball-bearing supported cable capstan transmissions are low friction, but complex and present challenges in routing multiple sets of cables. In this paper, we propose motion-decoupled cable transmission modules that address these challenges, occupying the middle ground, functioning as discrete-joint ball-bearing supported Bowden cables. Our rolling-plus-twist joint design decouples pairs of routed cables from changing significantly in tension, length, or friction during large angle motion of the linked transmission. Using sub-1 mm diameter high-strength synthetic cable, the transmission exhibits a maximum coupling motion of only 0.15 mm over the full range of motion of the cable-transmission mechanism, approximately 10% of pretension in combined hysteresis and friction, a transmission stiffness of 10 N/mm, weighing just 9 g per rolling joint and 5 g per twist joint. Two applications are demonstrated: cable routing alongside a robot arm for, say, gripper remote actuation, and remote needle advancement for an MRI-safe needle biopsy robot.

### [Advanced Xθ Reluctance Electromagnetic Micropositioning System for Precision Motion Control]()

This study examines a novel setup of a micropositioning trajectory manipulator in Xθ, energized by a reluctance actuator (RA) and two accompanying moving magnet actuators (MMA). The design is characterized by a C-core RA, which features asymmetrical air gaps between the mover and the stator elements when under angular θ rotation. When the stator coil is energized, a magnetic flux induces a force in the mover. Two MMAs can add force and torque dynamics to the system via solenoid and permanent magnet (PM) pairs to offer additional corrective actions. Facilitating control of a translational x and rotational θ two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) actuation system. Flexure hinges aid in the retraction force of the mover element and provide needed stiffness to the system without frictional effects. This was modeled analytically and optimized to achieve outlined performance objectives. The system was validated experimentally through triangle, and sinusoidal trajectories in open loop control. The most relevant application is scanning mirror systems where specific targeted rotational and translational trajectories can benefit light beam positioning. This system allows both translation and rotation specifications of a selected trajectory to be realized in one actuation unit, opening up more design possibilities for controlling precision positioning systems.

### [Cycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive Actuator Designs with Learning-Based Torque Estimation for Legged Robotics]()

This paper presents a novel approach through the design and implementation of Cycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive actuators for legged robotics. The cycloidal gear mechanism, with its inherent high torque density and mechanical robustness, offers significant advantages over conventional designs. By integrating cycloidal gears into the Quasi-Direct Drive framework, we aim to enhance the performance of legged robots, particularly in tasks demanding high torque and dynamic loads, while still keeping them lightweight. Additionally, we develop a torque estimation framework for the actuator using an Actuator Network, which effectively reduces the sim-to-real gap introduced by the cycloidal drive’s complex dynamics. This integration is crucial for capturing the complex dynamics of a cycloidal drive, which contributes to improved learning efficiency, agility, and adaptability for reinforcement learning.

### [Compact Modular Robotic Wrist with Variable Stiffness Capability]()

We have developed a two-degree-of-freedom robotic wrist with variable stiffness capability, designed for situations where collisions between the end-effector and the environment are inevitable. To enhance environmental adaptability and prevent physical damage, the wrist can operate in a low-stiffness mode. However, the flexibility of this mode might negatively impact stable and precise manipulation. To address this, we proposed a robotic wrist that switches between a passive low-stiffness mode for environmental adaptation and an active high-stiffness mode for precise manipulation. Initially, we developed a functional prototype that could manually switch between these modes, demonstrating the wrist's passive low-stiffness and active high-stiffness states. This prototype was designed as a lightweight, flat-type modular device, incorporating a sheet-type flexure as the motion guide and embedding all essential components, including actuators, sensors, and a control unit, into the wrist module. Based on the functional prototype, we developed an improved version to enhance durability and functionality. The resulting wrist module incorporates a three-axis F/T sensor and an impedance control system to control the stiffness. It measures 55 mm in height, weighs 200 g, and offers a 232.4-fold active stiffness variation.

### [A Natural-Neighbor-Interpolant-Based Pattern Modeling Method for Robust Decoding of the Structured Light Pattern (I)]()

Active stereo vision (ASV) computes the parallax and depth information from the coded structured light patterns. Thus, it could overcome the difficulties of measuring objects without textures and colors. However, decoding of the structured light patterns at locations of color crosstalk, specular reflection and occlusion remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a natural-neighbor-interpolant-based pattern modeling method to decode the structured light point pattern robustly. The robustness is achieved in the sense of hundred percent point segmentation completeness. Due to the hundred percent completeness, the points in the corresponding blocks are matched directly according to their indexes. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Automated Video Object Detection of Motile Cells under Microscopy]()

Video object detection (VOD) of motile cells (e.g., bacteria and sperm) under microscopy is challenging due to motion blur, sporadic out-of-focus, and pose variations. Compared with VOD in generic scenes, the lower contrast and smaller color space of microscopy imaging further introduce feature overlap between the foreground objects and the background objects (e.g., impurity cells and contaminants). Transformer-based methods have achieved great success in the VOD of generic scenes by utilizing object queries to model the inner-frame objects and the inter-frame objects. However, the appearance overlap problem in microscopy video frames significantly compromises the inter-frame query aggregation by introducing background features into the object query. To tackle this challenge, this paper reports a static-dynamic query-based VOD network that treats object queries of the current video frame and reference video frames differently. Specifically, a two-stage framework is implemented that first generates high-quality object queries of reference frames with a static Transformer decoder pre-trained on a still image dataset. The network is then trained on a per-frame annotated dataset using a dynamic Transformer decoder to model the object queries of the current frame. A Reference Query Relation Module is further proposed to enhance the reference queries for more effective aggregation with the current query. Experiments on clinically collected biopsied sperm datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Vision-Based Movement Primitives for Lunar Hazard Avoidance]()

To support sustainable infrastructure on the Moon, NASA is developing the In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Pilot Excavator (IPEx) to extract and transport lunar regolith for processing and construction. During its mission, IPEx will execute various driving patterns, primarily cycling between excavation and unloading sites, with additional maneuvers such as circular traverses around the lander and raster scans for environmental mapping. In this work, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are used to represent these patterns. We augment the DMPs with a vision-based real-time obstacle avoidance system to navigate surface hazards, such as rocks, encountered during traversal. Our approach is evaluated in a high-fidelity simulation replicating the challenging environment of the lunar south pole to demonstrate IPEx’s ability to adapt to surface hazards while fulfilling its operational tasks.

### [LAFNET: Lightweight Aerial Fire Detection Model for Onboard Edge Computing]()

Fire poses significant threats to life and property, necessitating efficient inspection and accurate identification. Although aerial computer vision algorithms hold great promise, the computational limitations of onboard platforms prevent existing algorithms from meeting high standards of accuracy and real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose an lightweight aerial fire detection model, LAFNET.

### [UDSV: Unsupervised Deep Stitching for Tractor-Trailer Surround View]()

In recent years, with the rapid development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), the demand for the precise and efficient surround view stitching system has significantly increased. Traditional stitching methods perform well in small single-unit vehicles with stable camera poses. However, the stitching quality sharply degrades when applied to large tractor-trailers due to the continuous pose changes caused by the non-rigid connection between the tractor and trailer. In detail, first, the extended length of tractor-trailers results in low overlap between cameras, making feature extraction and matching challenging. Additionally, the stitched images often appear irregular, detracting from visual quality. Besides, even if static stitching looks natural, it causes jitter in dynamic scenarios due to random feature extraction. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep stitching method for tractortrailer surround view system. We introduce a feature extraction module for tractor-trailer scenarios (FMT) to enhance feature extraction in low-overlap situations. Besides, we design a spatiotemporally consistent control point constraint strategy (STCC) to achieve spatial shape preservation and temporal smoothing effects, resulting in visually consistent and stable stitched sequences. Experimental results from both public and real dataset show that our method efficiently completes tractortrailer surround view stitching, producing well-aligned and natural panoramic images compared to previous methods.

### [Think Step by Step: Chain-Of-Gesture Prompting for Error Detection in Robotic Surgical Videos]()

Despite advancements in robotic systems and surgical data science, ensuring safe execution in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) remains challenging. Current methods for surgical error detection typically involve two parts: identifying gestures and then detecting errors within each gesture clip. These methods often overlook the rich contextual and semantic information inherent in surgical videos, with limited performance due to reliance on accurate gesture identification. Inspired by the chain-of-thought prompting in natural language processing, this letter presents a novel and real-time end-to-end error detection framework, Chain-of-Gesture (COG) prompting, integrating contextual information from surgical videos step by step. This encompasses two reasoning modules that simulate expert surgeons' decision-making: a Gestural-Visual Reasoning module using transformer and attention architectures for gesture prompting and a Multi-Scale Temporal Reasoning module employing a multi-stage temporal convolutional network with slow and fast paths for temporal information extraction. We validate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and show improvements over the state-of-the-art, achieving 4.6% higher F1 score, 4.6% higher Accuracy, and 5.9% higher Jaccard index, with an average frame processing time of 6.69 milliseconds. This demonstrates our approach's potential to enhance RMIS safety and surgical education efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/Chain-of-Gesture.

### [The Palletrone Cart: Human-Robot Interaction-Based Aerial Cargo Transportation]()

This paper presents a new cargo transportation solution based on physical human-robot interaction utilizing a novel fully-actuated multirotor platform called Palletrone. The platform is designed with a spacious upper flat surface for easy cargo loading, complemented by a rear-mounted handle reminiscent of a shopping cart. Flight trajectory control is achieved by a human operator gripping the handle and applying three-dimensional forces and torques while maintaining a stable cargo transport with zero roll and pitch attitude throughout the flight. To facilitate physical human-robot interaction, we employ an admittance control technique. Instead of relying on complex force estimation methods, like in most admittance control implementations, weintroduce a simple yet effective estimation technique based on a disturbance observer robust control algorithm. We conducted an analysisof the flight stability and performance in response to changes in system mass resulting from arbitrary cargo loading. Ultimately, we demonstrate that individuals can effectively control the system trajectory by applying appropriate interactive forces and torques. Furthermore, we showcase the performance of the system through various experimental scenarios.

### [Design of a Suspended Manipulator with Aerial Elliptic Winding]()

Art is one of the oldest forms of human expression, constantly evolving, taking new forms and using new techniques. With their increased accuracy and versatility, robots can be considered as a new class of tools to perform works of art. The STRAD (STReet Art Drone) project aims to perform a 10-meter- high painting on a vertical surface with sub-centimetric precision. To achieve this goal we introduce a new design for an aerial manipulator with elastic suspension capable of moving from one equilibrium position to another using only its thrusters and an elliptic pulley-counterweight system. A feedback linearization control law is implemented to perform fast and accurate winding and unwinding of an elastic cable.

### [Autonomous Heavy Object Pushing Using a Coaxial Tiltrotor (I)]()

Aerial physical interaction (APhI) with a multirotor-based platform such as pushing a heavy object demands generation of a sufficiently large interaction force while maintaining the stability. Such requirement can cause rotor saturation, because the rotor thrust enlarged for interaction force may leave a reduced margin for attitude stabilization. We first design an H -shaped coaxial tiltrotor that can generate a sufficiently large interaction force than a conventional multirotor. We then propose an overall framework composed of high-level robust controller and low-level control allocation for the coaxial tiltrotor to ensure robustness against uncertain motion of the unknown interacting object and to overcome the saturation issue. To guarantee the robustness at all time, we design a controller based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB). Then, we formulate a problem of computing low-level actuator inputs avoiding rotor saturation as a tractable nonlinear optimization problem, which can be solved real-time. The proposed framework is validated in extensive real-world experiments where the 3.3 kg tiltrotor successfully pushes a cart weighing up to 60 kg. An ablation study with the tiltrotor shows effectiveness of the proposed control allocation law in avoiding rotor saturation. Furthermore, a comparative experiment with a conventional multirotor shows failure in the same setting, which validates the use of the coaxial tiltrotor. An experimental video can be found at htt

### [Aerial Grasping by Multi-Limbed Flying Robot SPIDAR Based on Vectored Thrust Control]()

Delivery by aerial robots is an emerging topic in many scenarios, such as logistics, construction industry, and disaster response. Compared to the standard styles that deploy cage or sling, grasping style by gripper can handle objects in various shapes. A multi-limbed structure with distributed vectorable rotors called SPIDAR shows a higher potential to grasp large object in a three-dimensional manner. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the advanced usage of the vectored thrust forces to achieve aerial grasping by this robot. First, a vectored thrust control to avoid the aerointerference on the underwind segments (e.g., grasped object) during ﬂight is proposed. Then, an optimization-based planning method that utilizes redundant vectored thrust forces for ﬁrm grasping is developed. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ﬂight control and grasp planning by performing challenging grasping and transporting motion with a spherical object of which the diameter is 0.6m. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst to achieve multi-ﬁnger-like grasping to carry a large object in midair.

First, a computationally efficient trajectory optimization based on complementarity constraints is proposed to determine the optimal grasping time. To enable application in complex, dynamically changing environments, the future motion of the payload is predicted using a physics simulator-based model. The success of payload grasping under model uncertainties and external disturbances is formally verified through a robustness analysis method based on integral quadratic constraints. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator, and in real flight experiments using a custom-designed aerial manipulator platform.

### [Human-Aware Physical Human-Robot Collaborative Transportation and Manipulation with Multiple Aerial Robots]()

Human-robot interaction will play an essential role in various industries and daily tasks, enabling robots to effectively collaborate with humans and reduce their physical workload. This paper proposes a novel approach for physical human- robot collaborative transportation and manipulation of a cable- suspended payload with multiple aerial robots. The proposed method enables smooth and intuitive interaction between the transported objects and a human worker. In the same time, we consider distance constraints during the operations by exploiting the internal redundancy of the multi-robot transportation system. We validate the approach through extensive simulation and real-world experiments. These include scenarios where the robot team assists the human in transporting and manipulating a load, or where the human helps the robot team navigate the environment. We experimentally demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that our approach enables a quadrotor team to physically collaborate with a human in manipulating a payload in all 6 DoF in collaborative human- robot transportation and manipulation tasks.

### [VLN-KHVR: Knowledge-And-History Aware Visual Representation for Continuous Vision-And-Language Navigation]()

Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to navigate with low-level actions following natural language instructions in 3D environments. Most existing approaches utilize observation features from the current step to represent the viewpoint. However, these representations often conflate redundant and essential information for navigation, introducing ambiguity into the agent's action prediction. To address the problem of inadequate representation, we propose a Knowledge-and-History Aware Visual Representation for Continuous Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN-KHVR). The proposed approach constructs enriched visual representations tailored to navigation instructions, enhancing agents’ navigation performance. Specifically, VLN-KHVR extracts image features from the current observation, retrieves relevant knowledge in the knowledge base, and obtains the history of the navigation episode. Subsequently, the knowledge and history features are filtered to eliminate the information irrelevant to navigation instruction. These refined features are integrated with the instruction for further interaction. Finally, the aggregated features are used to guide navigation. Our model outperforms previous methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [LiteVLoc: Map-Lite Visual Localization for Image Goal Navigation]()

This paper presents LiteVLoc, a hierarchical vi-sual localization framework that uses a lightweight topo-metric map to represent the environment. The method consists of three sequential modules that estimate camera poses in a coarse-to-fine manner. Unlike dense 3D mapping methods, LiteVLoc reduces storage by avoiding geometric reconstruction. It uses a learning-based feature matcher to establish dense corre-spondences between sparse keyframes and observations, and then refines poses with a geometric solver, enabling robustness to viewpoint changes. The system assumes depth sensors or stereo camera for deployment. A novel dataset for the map-free relocalization task is also introduced. Extensive experiments including localization and navigation in both simulated and real-world scenarios have validate the system’s performance and demonstrated its precision and efficiency for large-scale de-ployment. Code and data will be made publicly available at the webpage: https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/LiteVLoc.

### [BEINGS: Bayesian Embodied Image-Goal Navigation with Gaussian Splatting]()

Image-goal navigation enables a robot to reach the location where a target image was captured, using visual cues for guidance. However, current methods either rely heavily on data and computationally expensive learning-based approaches or lack efficiency in complex environments due to insufficient exploration strategies. To address these limitations, we propose Bayesian Embodied Image-goal Navigation Using Gaussian Splatting, a novel method that formulates ImageNav as an optimal control problem within a model predictive control framework. BEINGS leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a scene prior to predict future observations, enabling efficient, real-time navigation decisions grounded in the robot’s sensory experiences. By integrating Bayesian updates, our method dynamically refines the robot's strategy without requiring extensive prior experience or data. Our algorithm is validated through extensive simulations and physical experiments, showcasing its potential for embodied robot systems in visually complex scenarios.

### [FLAF: Focal Line and Feature-Constrained Active View Planning for Visual Teach and Repeat]()

This paper presents FLAF, a focal line and feature-constrained active view planning method for tracking failure avoidance in feature-based visual navigation of mobile robots. FLAF is built on a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT&R) framework, which supports robotic applications by teaching robots to cruise various paths that fulfill many daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failures in feature-based Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM), particularly in textureless regions common in human-made environments, poses a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of VT&R. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based VSLAM system, creating an active VT&R solution that mitigates tracking failures. Our system features a Pan-Tilt Unit (PTU)-based active mounted on a mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM (AC-SLAM) operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeating phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF actively directs the camera toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points while following the learned trajectory. Experimental results in real scenarios show that FLAF significantly outperforms existing methods by accounting for feature identifiability, particularly the view angle of the features. While effectively dealing with low-texture regions in active view planning, considering feature identifiability enables our active VT&R system to perform well in challenging environments.

### [Ground-Level Viewpoint Vision-And-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments]()

Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment is still challenging. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.

### [NavTr: Object-Goal Navigation with Learnable Transformer Queries]()

This paper introduces Navigation Transformer (NavTr), a novel framework for object-goal navigation using Transformer queries to enhance the learning and representation of environment states. By integrating semantic information, object positions, and neighborhood information, NavTr creates a unified, comprehensive, and extensible state representation for the object-goal navigating task. In the framework, the Transformer queries implicitly learn inter-object relationships, which facilitates high-level understanding of the environment. Additionally, NavTr implements target-oriented supervisory signals, such as rotation rewards and spatial loss, which improve exploration efficiency in the reinforcement learning framework. NavTr outperforms popular graph-based and Attention-based methods by a large margin in terms of success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL). Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [Shape BoW: Generalized Bag of Words for Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection in Bathymetric SLAM]()

Existing bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods predominantly rely on odometry information for loop closure detection, which has a deteriorating performance when handling unreliable odometry data or conducting large-scale mapping missions. This letter introduces a novel generalized Bag of Words (BoW) named Shape BoW (S-BoW) for appearance-based loop closure detection in bathymetric SLAM. S-BoW is trained from the collection of the terrain gradient features extracted from existing bathymetric datasets and can be used in various bathymetric scenarios. We integrated the loop closure detection method using S-BoW into a feature-based bathymetric SLAM method called TTT SLAM, and we evaluated its performance against three existing bathymetric SLAM methods using two datasets. The results indicate that S-BoW not only serves as a generalized BoW but also enhances the efficiency of the integrated SLAM method, achieving accuracy comparable to the original TTT SLAM while offering a 37% speed improvement in a large-scale sea trial dataset. To the best of our knowledge, S-BoW is the first generalized BoW that can be used to realize effective appearance-based loop closure detection in bathymetric SLAM.

### [ODYSSEE: Oyster Detection Yielded by Sensor Systems on Edge Electronics]()

Oysters are an important keystone species in coastal ecosystems that provide several economic, environmental, and cultural benefits. Given the array of utilities derived from oysters, the application of autonomous robotic systems for oyster detection and monitoring grows increasingly relevant. However, current monitoring strategies for assessing oyster assemblages are mostly destructive. While manually identifying and monitoring oysters from video footage is nondestructive, is it tedious and requires expert input. An alternative to human monitoring is deploying trained object detection models on edge devices, such as the Aqua2 robot, to enable real-time monitoring of oysters directly in the field. Yet training these models to maximum efficacy requires an extensive dataset that accurately represents the domain, and it is difficult to obtain such high-quality training data due to the complications inherent to underwater environments. To address these complications, we introduce a novel method leveraging stable diffusion to generate high-quality synthetic data for the marine domain. We exploit diffusion models to create photorealistic oyster imagery, using ControlNet inputs to ensure consistency with the segmentation ground-truth mask, the geometry of the scene, and the target domain of real oyster images. This large dataset is used to train a vision model, specifically based on YOLOv10. The trained model is then deployed and tested on an edge platform, the Aqua2, in an underwater robotics system. We achieve state-of-the-art (0.657 mAP@50) for oyster detection, which can pave the way for autonomous oyster habitat monitoring and increase the efficiency of on-bottom oyster aquaculture

### [IBURD: Image Blending for Underwater Robotic Detection]()

We present an image blending pipeline, IBURD, that creates realistic synthetic images to assist in the training of deep detectors for use on underwater autonomous vehicles (AUVs) for marine debris detection tasks. Specifically, IBURD generates both images of underwater debris and their pixel-level annotations, using source images of debris objects, their annotations, and target background images of marine environments. With Poisson editing and style transfer techniques, IBURD is even able to robustly blend transparent objects into arbitrary backgrounds and automatically adjust the style of blended images using the blurriness metric of target background images. These generated images of marine debris in actual underwater backgrounds address the data scarcity and data variety problems faced by deep-learned vision algorithms in challenging underwater conditions, and can enable the use of AUVs for environmental cleanup missions. Both quantitative and robotic evaluations of IBURD demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for robotic detection of marine debris.

### [3DSSDF: Underwater 3D Sonar Reconstruction Using Signed Distance Functions]()

Underwater autonomous robotic operations require online localization and 3D mapping. Because of the absence of absolute positioning underwater, these tasks strongly rely on embedded sensors, including proprioceptive or navigation sensors — which can be fused for an odometry, — and exteroceptive sensors. One of the most popular exteroceptive sensors for underwater is the imaging sonar, which emits a large fan-shaped acoustic signal and estimates the position of the surrounding obstacles from a measure of the reflected signal. This paper addresses underwater online localization and 3D mapping using a forward looking, wide-aperture imaging sonar and vehicle’s intrinsic navigation estimates. We introduce 3DSSDF (3D Sonar Reconstruction Using Signed Distance Functions), a new localization and 3D mapping algorithm based on signed distance functions, which is evaluated in simulation and on real data, in man-made and natural environments. Comparisons to reference trajectories and maps demonstrate that, in our tests, 3DSSDF efficiently corrects navigation drift and that trajectory and map accuracy is always below 1 m and below 1% of the distanced travelled, which can be sufficient for the safe inspection of natural or artificial underwater structures.

### [Cascade IPG Observer for Underwater Robot State Estimation]()

This paper presents a novel cascade nonlinear observer framework for inertial state estimation. It tackles the problem of intermediate state estimation when external localization is unavailable or in the event of a sensor outage. The proposed observer comprises two nonlinear observers based on a recently developed iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) algorithm. It takes the inputs via an IMU preintegration model where the first observer is a quaternion-based IPG. The output for the first observer is the input for the second observer, estimating the velocity and, consequently, the position. The proposed observer is validated on a public underwater dataset and a real-world experiment using our robot platform. The estimation is compared with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). Results demonstrate that our method outperforms these methods regarding better positional accuracy and lower variance.

### [ResiVis: A Holistic Underwater Motion Planning Approach for Robust Active Perception under Uncertainties]()

Motion planning for autonomous active perception in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem, requiring real-time solutions that both maximize safety and achieve a desired behavior. In dynamic underwater environments, such as in aquaculture operations, the robots are additionally expected to deal with state and motion uncertainty and errors, dynamic and deformable obstacles, currents, and disturbances. Previous work has introduced real-time frameworks that provided safe navigation in cluttered environments, active perception in static environments, and robust navigation in uncertain dynamic environments. This paper introduces a new real-time approach called ResiVis, which leverages the best aspects of the aforementioned techniques along with a new formulation that further enhances underwater autonomy by enabling active perception of static and dynamic target objects from desired distances. The proposed method utilizes path-optimization for real-time response with constraints guaranteeing continuous collision safety, and computes paths with clearance adaptive to both the conditions of the environments and the performance of the path follower. An improved new constraint encourages observations of dynamic objects with the planner adapting to satisfy desired observation distances and their projected future positions. ResiVis is validated with challenging simulation experiments and with hardware-in-the-loop trials in real industrial-scale aquaculture facilities.

### [Energy-Optimal Asymmetrical Gait Selection for Quadrupedal Robots]()

Symmetrical gaits, such as trotting, are com- monly employed in quadrupedal robots for their simplicity and stability. However, the potential of asymmetrical gaits, such as bounding and galloping—which are prevalent in their natural counterparts at high speeds or over long distances—is less clear in the design of locomotion controllers for legged machines. In these asymmetrical gaits, the system dynamics are more complex because the front and rear leg pairs exhibit different motions, which are coupled by the rotational motion of the torso. This study systematically examines five distinct asymmetrical quadrupedal gaits on a legged robot, aiming to uncover the fundamental differences in footfall sequences and the consequent energetics across a broad range of speeds. Utilizing a full-body model of a quadrupedal robot (Unitree A1), we developed a hybrid system for each gait, incorporating the desired footfall sequence and rigid impacts. To identify the most energy-optimal gait, we applied optimal control methods, framing it as a trajectory optimization problem with specific constraints and a work-based cost of transport as an objective function. Our results show that, in the context of asymmetrical gaits, when minimizing cost of transport across the entire stride, the front leg pair primarily propels the system forward, while the rear leg pair acts more like an inverted pendulum, contributing significantly less to the energetic output. Addi- tionally, while bounding—characterized by two aerial phases per cycle—is the most energy-optimal gait at higher speeds, the energy expenditure of gaits at speeds below 1 m/s depend heavily on the robot’s specific design.

### [Bipedal Walking with Continuously Compliant Robotic Legs]()

In biomechanics and robotics, elasticity plays a crucial role in enhancing locomotion efficiency and stability. Traditional approaches in legged robots often employ series elastic actuators (SEA) with discrete rigid components, which, while effective, add weight and complexity. This paper presents an innovative alternative by integrating continuously compliant structures into the lower legs of a bipedal robot, fundamentally transforming the SEA concept. Our approach replaces traditional rigid segments with lightweight, deformable materials, reducing overall mass and simplifying the actuation design. This novel design introduces unique challenges in modeling, sensing, and control, due to the infinite dimensionality of continuously compliant elements. We address these challenges through effective approximations and control strategies. The paper details the design and modeling of the compliant leg structure, presents low-level force and kinematics controllers, and introduces a high-level posture controller with a gait scheduler. Experimental results demonstrate successful bipedal walking using this new design.

### [Optimal Torque Distribution Via Dynamic Adaptation for Quadrupedal Locomotion on Slippery Terrains]()

As legged robots continue to evolve, new control methods are being developed to provide fast, robust, accurate and computationally efficient algorithms for traversing challenging environments. This paper presents a real-time adaptive locomotion controller for quadrupeds, designed to maintain stability and controllability on various surfaces, including highly slippery terrains. The proposed approach optimizes control effort distribution based on the probability of slippage by utilizing a surface-independent adaptation layer. By balancing the robot's redundant kinematic system through rank relaxation—similar to loosening constraints in optimization problems—this method demonstrates significant performance improvements. Unlike Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, which depend on pre-trained policies and may struggle to adapt velocity tracking control across different terrains, our method rapidly adjusts to changing conditions, as validated by extensive simulation experiments.

### [Adaptive Energy Regularization for Autonomous Gait Transition and Energy-Efficient Quadruped Locomotion]()

In reinforcement learning for legged robot locomotion, crafting effective reward strategies is crucial. Predefined gait patterns and complex reward systems are widely used to stabilize policy training. Drawing from the natural locomotion behaviors of humans and animals, which adapt their gaits to minimize energy consumption, we investigate the impact of incorporating an energy-efficient reward term that prioritizes distance-averaged energy consumption into the reinforcement learning framework. Our findings demonstrate that this simple addition enables quadruped robots to autonomously select appropriate gaits—such as four-beat walking at lower speeds and trotting at higher speeds—without the need for explicit gait regularizations. Furthermore, we provide a guideline for tuning the weight of this energy-efficient reward, facilitating its application in real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through simulations and on a real Unitree Go1 robot. This research highlights the potential of energy-centric reward functions to simplify and enhance the learning of adaptive and efficient locomotion in quadruped robots.

### [Music-Driven Legged Robots: Synchronized Walking to Rhythmic Beats]()

We address the challenge of effectively controlling the locomotion of legged robots by incorporating precise frequency and phase characteristics, which is often ignored in locomotion policies that do not account for the periodic nature of walking. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a low-level phase tracker, oscillators, and a high-level phase modulator. This controller allows quadruped robots to walk in a natural manner that is synchronized with external musical rhythms. Our method generates diverse gaits across different frequencies and achieves real-time synchronization with music in the physical world. This research establishes a foundational framework for enabling real-time execution of accurate rhythmic motions in legged robots. The video and code are available at https://music-walker.github.io/.

### [Mobile-TeleVision: Predictive Motion Priors for Humanoid Whole-Body Control]()

Humanoid robots require both robust lower-body locomotion and precise upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion policy is trained and conditioned on this upper-body motion representation, ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion. We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation. With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control, operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.

### [Distributed Safe Navigation of Multi-Agent Systems Using Control Barrier Function-Based Controllers]()

This paper proposes a distributed controller synthesis framework for safe navigation of multi-agent systems. We leverage control barrier functions to formulate collision avoidance with obstacles and teammates as constraints on the control input for a state-dependent network optimization problem that encodes team formation and the navigation task. Our algorithmic solution is valid under general assumptions for nonlinear dynamics and state-dependent network optimization problems with convex constraints and strongly convex objectives. The resulting controller is distributed, satisfies the safety constraints at all times, and asymptotically converges to the solution of the state-dependent network optimization problem. We illustrate its performance in a team of differential-drive robots in a variety of complex environments, both in simulation and in hardware.

The main advantages of this approach include: (i) enforcing area occupancy constraints derived from specific task requirements; (ii) enhancing computational scalability by eliminating the need for collision avoidance constraints between robotic agents; and (iii) the ability to anticipate and avoid deadlocks between agents. The paper includes both simulations and physical experiments demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness in various representative scenarios

### [Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Collision Avoidance in Quadrotor Teams with Limited Detection Range]()

Multi-quadrotor systems face significant challenges in decentralized control, particularly with safety and coordination under sensing and communication limitations. State-of-the-art methods leverage Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees but often neglect actuation constraints and limited detection range. To address these gaps, we propose a novel decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that integrates Exponential CBFs (ECBFs) to enhance safety and optimality in multi-quadrotor systems. We provide both conservative and practical minimum bounds of the range that preserve the safety guarantees of the ECBFs. We validate our approach through extensive simulations with up to 10 quadrotors and 20 obstacles, as well as real-world experiments with 3 quadrotors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in realistic settings, highlighting its potential for reliable quadrotor teams operations.

### [SIGMA: Sheaf-Informed Geometric Multi-Agent Pathfinding]()

The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to determine the shortest and collision-free paths for multiple agents in a known, potentially obstacle-ridden environment. It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

### [An Efficient NSGA-II-Based Algorithm for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning]()

This work presents an algorithm based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve multi-objective offline Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) problems. The proposed algorithm embeds a donation-mutation operator and a multiple-parent crossover that generates solutions which maintain the longest path while minimizing the average path length. The algorithm also uses a library of elitism-selected high-fitness robot paths, and tournament-selected high min-max fitness paths, to construct high multi-objective fitness offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art NSGA-II extended with an improved Heuristic Genetic Algorithm Crossover, and we demonstrate that for different instances of the MCPP problem, the Pareto-fronts of our proposed algorithm are not dominated by any of the points of the fronts generated by the state-of-the-art NSGA-II. A comparison has also been performed in a virtual environment simulating five drones inspecting three wind turbines. Results show that our approach exhibits a higher convergence rate for higher values of the ratio between the number of points to visit and the number of drones.

### [An Iterative Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Route Planning with Resource Transportation Uncertainty and Temporal Logic Goals]()

This paper presents an iterative approach for heterogeneous multi-agent route planning in environments with unknown resource distributions. We focus on a team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.

### [Connectivity-Preserving Distributed Informative Path Planning for Mobile Robot Networks]()

This letter addresses the distributed informative path planning (IPP) problem for a mobile robot network to optimally explore a spatial field. Each robot is able to gather noisy environmental measurements while navigating the environment and build its own model of a spatial phenomenon using the Gaussian process and local data. The IPP optimization problem is formulated in an informative way through a multi-step prediction scheme constrained by connectivity preservation and collision avoidance. The shared hyperparameters of the local Gaussian process models are also arranged to be optimally computed in the path planning optimization problem. By the use of the proximal alternating direction method of multiplier, the optimization problem can be effectively solved in a distributed manner. It theoretically proves that the connectivity in the network is maintained over time whilst the solution of the optimization problem converges to a stationary point. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in synthetic experiments by utilizing a real-world dataset.

### [A Hierarchical Framework for Solving the Constrained Multiple Depot Traveling Salesman Problem]()

The Multiple Depot Traveling Salesman Problem (MDTSP) is a variant of the NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with more than one salesman to jointly visit all destinations, commonly found in task planning in multi-agent robotic systems. Traditional MDTSP overlooks practical constraints like limited battery level and inter-agent conflicts, often leading to infeasible or unsafe solutions in reality. In this work, we incorporate energy and resource consumption constraints to form the Constrained MDTSP (CMDTSP). We design a novel hierarchical framework to obtain high-quality solutions with low computational complexity. The framework decomposes a given CMDTSP instance into manageable sub-problems, each handled individually via a TSP solver and heuristic search to generate tours. The tours are then aggregated and processed through a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), which contains significantly fewer variables and constraints than the MILP for the exact CMDTSP, to form a feasible solution efficiently. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on both real-world and synthetic datasets. It reaches a mean 12.48% optimality gap and 41.7x speedup over the exact method on common instances and a 5.22%sim14.84% solution quality increase with more than 79.8x speedup over the best baseline on large instances where the exact method times out.

### [Fully Differentiable Adaptive Informative Path Planning]()

Autonomous robots can survey and monitor large environments. However, these robots often have limited computational and power resources, making it crucial to develop an efficient and adaptive informative path planning (IPP) algorithm. Such an algorithm must quickly adapt to environmental data to maximize the information collected while accommodating path constraints, such as distance budgets and boundary limitations. Current approaches to this problem often rely on maximizing mutual information using methods such as greedy algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and genetic algorithms. These methods can be slow and do not scale well to large or 3D environments. We present an adaptive IPP approach that is fully differentiable, significantly faster than previous methods, and scalable to 3D spaces. Our approach also supports continuous sensing robots, which collect data continuously along the entire path, by leveraging streaming sparse Gaussian processes.Benchmark results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach yields solutions that are on par with or better than baseline methods while being up to two orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, we showcase our adaptive IPP approach in a 3D space using a system-on-chip embedded computer with minimal computational resources. Our code is available in the SGP-Tools Python library with a companion ROS 2 package for deployment on ArduPilot-based robots.

### [Online Informative Motion Planning for Active Information Gathering of a Non-Stationary Gaussian Process]()

Information gathering focuses on designing strategies for a robot to collect data about a physical process, aiming for accurate field reconstruction. While many recent methods have been proposed to address this problem, they often assume the model of the physical process is a priori known and stationary—assumptions that rarely hold in practice. This paper presents a novel informative motion planning approach for online information gathering of a non-stationary Gaussian process. Our approach comprises two key components: an informative path planner that explores the physical field and an adaptive velocity planner that adjusts the robot's velocity profile exploiting the field's spatial variability. Additionally, we propose a path smoothing and tracking strategy to ensure continuous robot motion. Extensive simulations on a bathymetric mapping task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing superior performance in reconstructing non-stationary physical fields compared to several baseline methods.

### [REACT: Multi Robot Energy-Aware Orchestrator for Indoor Search and Rescue Critical Tasks]()

Smart factories enhance production efficiency and sustainability, but emergencies like human errors, machinery failures and natural disasters pose significant risks. In critical situations, such as fires or earthquakes, collaborative robots can assist first-responders by entering damaged buildings and locating missing persons, mitigating potential losses. Unlike previous solutions that overlook the critical aspect of energy management, in this paper we propose REACT, a smart energy-aware orchestrator that optimizes the exploration phase, ensuring prolonged operational time and effective area coverage. Our solution leverages a fleet of collaborative robots equipped with advanced sensors and communication capabilities to explore and navigate unknown indoor environments, such as smart factories affected by fires or earthquakes, with high density of obstacles. By leveraging real-time data exchange and cooperative algorithms, the robots dynamically adjust their paths, minimize redundant movements and reduce energy consumption. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of search and rescue missions in complex indoor environments, improving the exploration rate by 10% over existing methods and reaching a map coverage of 97% under time critical operations, up to nearly 100% under relaxed time constraint.

### [Multi-Agent Ergodic Exploration under Smoke-Based Time-Varying Visibility Constraints]()

In this work, we consider the problem of multi-agent informative path planning (IPP) for robots whose sensor visibility evolves over time as a consequence of a time-varying natural phenomenon. We leverage ergodic trajectory optimization (ETO), which generates paths such that the amount of time an agent spends in an area is proportional to the expected information in that area. We focus specifically on the problem of multi-agent drone search of a wildfire, where we use the time-varying environmental process of smoke diffusion to construct a sensor visibility model. This sensor visibility model is used to repeatedly calculate an expected information distribution (EID) to be used in the ETO algorithm. Our experiments show that our exploration method achieves improved information gathering over both baseline search methods and naive ergodic search formulations.

### [DiffTune-MPC: Closed-Loop Learning for Model Predictive Control]()

Model predictive control (MPC) has been applied to many platforms in robotics and autonomous systems for its capability to predict a system's future behavior while incorporating constraints that a system may have. To enhance the performance of a system with an MPC controller, one can manually tune the MPC's cost function. However, it can be challenging due to the possibly high dimension of the parameter space as well as the potential difference between the open-loop cost function in MPC and the overall closed-loop performance metric function. This paper presents DiffTune-MPC, a novel learning method, to learn the cost function of an MPC in a closed-loop manner. The proposed framework is compatible with the scenario where the time interval for performance evaluation and MPC's planning horizon have different lengths. We show the auxiliary problem whose solution admits the analytical gradients of MPC and discuss its variations in different MPC settings, including nonlinear MPCs that are solved using sequential quadratic programming. Simulation results demonstrate the learning capability of DiffTune-MPC and the generalization capability of the learned MPC parameters.

### [CaDRE: Controllable and Diverse Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios Using Real-World Trajectories]()

Simulation is an indispensable tool in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offering an efficient and safe alternative to road testing. An outstanding challenge with simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework, CaDRE, to generate realistic, diverse, and controllable safety-critical scenarios. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world scenarios, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning (RL) and sampling-based methods.

### [Certificated Actor-Critic: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Control Barrier Functions for Safe Navigation]()

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a prominent approach to designing safe navigation systems of robots. Despite their popularity, current CBF-based methods exhibit some limitations: optimization-based safe control techniques tend to be either myopic or computationally intensive, and they rely on simplified system models; conversely, the learning-based methods suffer from the lack of quantitative indication in terms of navigation performance and safety. In this paper, we present a new model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Certificated Actor-Critic (CAC), which introduces a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and well-defined reward functions derived from CBFs. We carry out theoretical analysis and proof of our algorithm, and propose several improvements in algorithm implementation. Our analysis is validated by two simulation experiments, showing the effectiveness of our proposed CAC algorithm.

### [Exact Imposition of Safety Boundary Conditions in Neural Reachable Tubes]()

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely adopted verification tool to provide safety and performance guarantees for autonomous systems. However, it involves solving a partial differential equation (PDE) to compute a safety value function, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making its direct application to large-scale systems intractable. To overcome these challenges, DeepReach,a recently proposed learning-based approach, approximates high-dimensional reachable tubes using neural networks (NNs). While shown to be effective, the accuracy of the learned solution decreases with system complexity. One of the reasons for this degradation is a soft imposition of safety constraints during the learning process, which corresponds to the boundary conditions of the PDE, resulting in inaccurate value functions. In this work, we propose ExactBC, a variant of DeepReach that imposes safety constraints exactly during the learning process by restructuring the overall value function as a weighted sum of the boundary condition and the NN output. Moreover, the proposed variant no longer needs a boundary loss term during the training process, thus eliminating the need to balance different loss terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in significantly improving the accuracy of the learned value function for four challenging reachability tasks: a rimless wheel system with state resets, collision avoidance in a cluttered environment, autonomous rocket landing, and multi-aircraft collision avoidance.

### [RelAIBotiX: Reliability Assessment for AI-Controlled Robotic Systems]()

AI-controlled robotic systems can introduce significant risks to both humans and the environment. Traditional reliability assessment methods fall short in addressing the complexities of these systems, particularly when dealing with black-box or dynamically changing control policies. The traditional approaches are applied manually and do not consider frequent software updates. In this paper, we present RelAIBotiX, a new methodology that enables dynamic and continuous reliability assessment, specifically tailored for robotic systems controlled by AI-Algorithms. RelAIBotiX is a dynamic reliability assessment framework that combines four methods: (i) Skill Detection that automatically identifies executed skills using deep learning techniques, (ii) Behavioral Analysis that creates an operational profile of the robotic system containing information about the skill execution sequence, active components for each skill, and their utilization intensity that influence their failure rate, (iii) Reliability Model Generation that automatically transforms the operational profile and reliability data of robotic hardware components into quantitative hybrid reliability models, and (iv) Reliability Model Solver for the numerical evaluation of the generated reliability models. Our evaluation included computing the reliability of the system, the probability of failure of individual skills, and component sensitivity analysis. We validated the applicability of the proposed framework in five simulative and real-world setups.

### [Adaptive Emotional Expression in Social Robots: A Multimodal Approach to Dynamic Emotion Modeling]()

Social robots have been extensively studied in recent decades, with many researchers exploring the use of modalities such as facial expressions to achieve more natural emotions in robots. Various methods have been attempted to generate and express robot emotions, including computational models that define an affect space and show dynamic emotion changes. However, the implementation of multimodal expression in previous models is ambiguous, and the generation of emotions in response to stimuli relies on heuristic methods. In this paper, we present a framework that enables robots to naturally express their emotions in a multimodal way, where the emotion can change over time based on the given stimulus values. By representing the robot’s emotion as a position in an affect space of a computational emotion model, we consider the given stimuli values as driving forces that can shift the emotion position dynamically. In order to examine the feasibility of our proposed method, a mobile robot prototype was implemented that can recognize touch and express different emotions with facial expressions and movements. The experiment demonstrated that the emotion elicited by a given stimulus is contingent upon the robot’s previous state, thereby imparting the impression that the robot possesses a distinctive emotion model. Furthermore, the Godspeed survey results indicated that our model was rated significantly higher than the baseline, which did not include a computational emotion model, in terms of anthropomorphism, animacy, and perceived intelligence. Notably, the unpredictabil ity of emotion switching contributed to a perception of greater lifelikeness, which in turn enhanced the overall interaction experience.

### [CAS: Fusing DNN Optimization & Adaptive Sensing for Energy-Efficient Multi-Modal Inference]()

Intelligent virtual agents are used to accomplish complex multi-modal tasks such as human instruction comprehension in mixed-reality environments by increasingly adopting richer, energy-intensive sensors and processing pipelines. In such applications, the context for activating sensors and processing blocks required to accomplish a given task instance is usually manifested via multiple sensing modes. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel Commit-and-Switch (CAS) paradigm that simultaneously seeks to reduce both sensing and processing energy. In CAS, we first commit to a low-energy computational pipeline with a subset of available sensors. Then, the task context estimated by this pipeline is used to optionally switch to another energy-intensive DNN pipeline and activate additional sensors. We demonstrate how CAS’s paradigm of interweaving DNN computation and sensor triggering can be instantiated principally by constructing multi-head DNN models and jointly optimizing the accuracy and sensing costs associated with different heads. We exemplify CAS via the development of the RealGIN-MH model for multi-modal target acquisition tasks, a core enabler of immersive human-agent interaction. RealGIN-MH achieves 12.9x reduction in energy overheads, while outperforming baseline dynamic model optimization approaches.

### ["Oh! It's Fun Chatting with You!" a Humor-Aware Social Robot Chat Framework]()

Humor is a key element in human interactions, essential for building connections and rapport. To enhance human-robot communication, we developed a humor-aware chat framework that enables robots to deliver contextually appropriate humor. This framework takes into account the interaction environment, and user’s profile as well as emotional state. Two GPT models are used to generate responses. The initial one, named sensor-GPT, processes contextual data from the sensor along with the user’s response and conversation history to create prompts for the second one, chat-GPT. These prompts can guide the model on how to integrate appropriate humor elements into the conversation, ensuring that the dialogue is both contextually relevant and humorous. Our experiment compared the effectiveness of humor expression between our framework and the GPT-4o model. The results demonstrate that robots using our framework significantly outperform those using GPT-4o in humor expression, extending conversations, and improving overall interaction quality.

### [Social Gesture Recognition in SpHRI: Leveraging Fabric-Based Tactile Sensing on Humanoid Robots]()

Humans are able to convey different messages using only touch. Equipping robots with the ability to understand social touch adds another modality in which humans and robots can communicate. In this paper, we present a social gesture recognition system using a fabric-based, large-scale tactile sensor integrated onto the arms of a humanoid robot. We built a social gesture dataset using multiple participants and extracted temporal features for classification. By collecting real-world data on a humanoid robot, our system provides valuable insights into human-robot social touch, further advancing the development of spHRI systems for more natural and effective communication.

### [Seeing Eye to Eye: Design and Evaluation of a Custom Expressive Eye Display Module for the Stretch Mobile Manipulator]()

Mobile manipulators - robots with a moving base and an arm for grasping objects - are becoming more common in human-populated environments, such as hospitals, warehouses, and even homes. Yet most mobile manipulators lack clear ways to communicate intent to human interlocutors in a continuous, socially acceptable, and easy-to-interpret way. One possible solution for improving mobile manipulator communication is the addition of expressive eyes. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a custom expressive LED eye module for mobile manipulators, which can display both gaze and emotional expressions. Our evaluation study (N = 32) involved a mock teamwork task alongside a Hello Robot Stretch RE2 mobile manipulator with the custom LED eye module. The results showed that both gaze and emotional expressions supported better participant performance in the task and more feelings of social closeness. Emotional eye expressions also yielded higher ratings of robot social warmth and competence. This work can inform mobile manipulator design for smoother integration into human-populated spaces.

### [UGotMe: An Embodied System for Affective Human-Robot Interaction]()

Equipping humanoid robots with the capability to understand emotional states of human interactants and express emotions appropriately according to situations is essential for affective human-robot interaction. However, enabling current vision-aware multimodal emotion recognition models for affective human-robot interaction in the real-world raises embodiment challenges: addressing the environmental noise issue and meeting real-time requirements. First, in multiparty conversation scenarios, the noises inherited in the visual observation of the robot, which may come from either 1)distracting objects in the scene or 2) inactive speakers appearing in the field of view of the robot, hinder the models from extracting emotional cues from vision inputs. Secondly, realtime response, a desired feature for an interactive system, is also challenging to achieve. To tackle both challenges, we introduce an affective human-robot interaction system called UGotMe designed specifically for multiparty conversations. Two denoising strategies are proposed and incorporated into the system to solve the first issue. Specifically, to filter out distracting objects in the scene, we propose extracting face images of the speakers from the raw images and introduce a customized active face extraction strategy to rule out inactive speakers. As for the second issue, we employ efficient data transmission from the robot to the local server to improve realtime response capability. We deploy UGotMe on a human robot named Ameca to validate its real-time inference capabilities in practical scenarios. Videos demonstrating real-world deployment are available at https://lipzh5.github.io/HumanoidVLE/

### [SCU-Hand: Soft Conical Universal Robotic Hand for Scooping Granular Media from Containers of Various Sizes]()

Automating small-scale experiments in materials science presents challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of experimental setups. This study introduces the SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed to automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to different container geometries through deformation, maintaining consistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft robotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves high flexibility while retaining the necessary rigidity for effective powder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabrication process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with a scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as materials synthesis and characterization processes.

### [VSB - Variable Stiffness Based on Bowden Cables: A Simple Mechanism for Soft Robotic Hands]()

Soft robotic hands compensate for uncertainty in perception and actuation by leveraging passive deformation in their intrinsically compliant hardware, facilitating robust and dexterous interactions with their environment. The ability to adjust the level of compliance during operation has the potential to further improve the performance of these hands by enabling novel interaction strategies. However, achieving variable stiffness mechanically typically requires significant engineering complexity, making these systems difficult to manufacture, prone to error, and expensive. We present a novel, very simple mechanism for achieving variable stiffness. This mechanism employs tendon-driven antagonistic actuation, with Bowden cables connecting elastic elements to servomotors. It supports compact actuator designs, while the Bowden cables facilitate flexible component placement within a robotic system. Following our approach, variable stiffness actuators can be easily manufactured at low-cost from readily available materials. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that our mechanism provides consistent and precise control over stiffness levels and contact torques, showcasing its potential for a broad range of applications in soft robotic systems.

### [Design and Experimental Validation of Woodwork-Inspired Soft Pneumatic Grippers]()

This paper presents a novel design concept of a pair of soft gripper hands that can establish a secure connection between them for bearing a large load with a low air pressure. The design was inspired by dovetail joints in carpentry that enable a tight, strong connection between two pieces of wood. We propose to mimic the dovetail joint mechanism by using soft robotic fingers that interlace to each other for secure connection. The work was motivated by the need for securing a connection between two soft robotic arms for holding a balance-impaired older adult in case of losing balance. First, the design principle of dovetail-like secure soft finger connection is presented, and its potential application to a portable fall prevention system is described. Details of the dovetail soft finger design, its rapid inflation method, and other implementation issues are then discussed. Through experiments of a proof-of-concept prototype, it is validated that the dovetail soft fingers can bear at least 18 kg of load with only 52 kPa of air chamber pressure filled in 250 ms of charging time. At the end, the proposed method is compared to alternative methods using a Pugh chart.

### [A Variable Stiffness and Transformable Entanglement Soft Robotic Gripper]()

For objects with complex topological and geometrical features, stochastic topological grasping can be executed without the necessity for feedback or precise planning. However, this grasping method has two significant limitations. First, the technique’s effectiveness is reduced when interacting with topologically and geometrically simple objects like spheres, cubes, and cylinders, due to the inherent variability in grasping patterns. Additionally, the method’s low stiffness restricts its ability to securely handling heavier objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an entanglement soft robotic gripper with variable stiffness and two transformed grasping modes (entanglement and clamping modes). The gripper contains three filaments, which can enhance the stiffness through the mechanism of layer jamming. Furthermore, the entanglement mode and the clamping mode, can be transformed by adjusting the working length of the filaments. The grasping performance comparison with and without variable stiffness was carried out, and the results indicated that the implementation of variable stiffness led to a 149 % increase in payload weight. Through experimental validation, we successfully employed the gripper in variable stiffness and transformed modes to grasp items with various shapes and weights. Demonstration of grasping heavier objects and transforming between two grasping modes were also conducted to showcase the adaptability and versatility of the gripper.

### [Soft Robotic Dynamic In-Hand Pen Spinning]()

Dynamic in-hand manipulation remains a challenging task for soft robotic systems that have demonstrated advantages in safe compliant interactions but struggle with high-speed dynamic tasks. In this work, we present SoftSpin, a system for dynamic spinning using a soft and compliant robotic hand. Unlike previous works that rely on quasi-static actions and precise object models, the proposed system learns to spin a pen through trial-and-error using only real-world data without requiring explicit prior knowledge of the pen’s physical attributes. With self-labeled trials sampled from the real world, the system discovers the set of pen grasping and spinning primitive parameters that enables a soft hand to spin the pen robustly and reliably. After 130 sampled actions, SoftSpin achieves 100 % success rate across three pens with different weights and weight distributions, demonstrating the system’s generalizability and robustness to changes in object properties. The results highlight the potential for soft robotic end-effectors to perform dynamic tasks including rapid in-hand manipulation. We also demonstrate that SoftSpin generalizes to spinning tools with different shapes and weights such as a brush and a screwdriver which we spin with 10/10 and 5/10 success rates respectively. Videos, data, and code are available at https://soft-spin.github.io

### [Kinetostatics and Retention Force Analysis of Soft Robot Grippers with External Tendon Routing]()

Soft robots (SR) are a class of continuum robots that enable safe human interaction with task versatility beyond rigid robots. This has resulted in their rapid adoption in a number of applications that require manipulation of delicate and irregular objects. Despite their advantages, SR grippers typically require case-specific experimental characterization for shape and gripper retention force estimation. This letter presents a kinetostatic modeling approach based on strain energy minimization subject to mechanics and geometric constraints for shape estimation of SR grippers with external tendon routing (ETR), including those with composite structures. Additionally, Castigliano's First Theorem is used to estimate the retention force of the gripper. These models are evaluated across four different ETR SR grippers. The mechanics model predicted the fingertip position and orientation with an accuracy of 1.06±0.62 mm (1.79%±1.05% of length) and 3.58°±2.82° with respect to tendon force and 0.72±0.45 mm (1.22%±0.76% of length) and 2.86°±2.11° with respect to tendon retraction. The retention force of the gripper was predicted with an average error of 0.20±0.12 N.

### [Ego-A3: Adaptive Fusion-Based Disentangled Transformer for Egocentric Action Anticipation]()

Recently, egocentric action anticipation for wearable robotics cameras has gained considerable attention due to its capability to analyze nouns and verbs from a first-person view. However, this field encounters challenges due to various uncertainties, such as action-irrelevant information and semantically fused representations of verbs and nouns. To overcome these issues, we introduce Ego-A3, designed to improve the robustness and reliability of egocentric action anticipation systems. Ego-A3 adaptively extracts action-relevant data to efficiently utilize additional information beyond visual data. Additionally, Ego-A3 produces effective disentangled representations for verbs and nouns by employing learnable verb and noun queries. Experiments on the EpicKitchens-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets demonstrate that Ego-A3 outperforms existing methods in top-1 accuracy and mean top-5 recall. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/alsgur0720/egocentric_anticipation.

### [A New Variable-Gain Sliding Mode Filter and Its Application to Velocity Filtering]()

This paper proposes a new variable gain sliding mode filter augmented by variable windowing for achieving smooth and reactive response over a broad range of input frequencies. The proposed filter can be seen as a synergistic combination of Kikuuwe et al.’s [1] sliding mode filter with varying gain and sliding surfaces and a novel varying-length moving-window algorithm. In all schemes, the estimated input speed is employed for rendering the filter parameters between low and high settings. The discrete-time algorithm of the proposed filter does not suffer from chattering due to implicit (backward) Euler method. The effectiveness of the proposed filter in achieving better trade-off between noise attenuation and signal preservation is validated in both simulation and experimental scenarios by using the velocity signal obtained by differentiation of quantized position data.

### [A Comparative Study between a Virtual Wand and a One-To-One Approach for the Teleoperation of a Nearby Robotic Manipulator]()

The prevailing and most effective approach to teleoperate a robotic arm involves a direct position-to-position mapping, imposing robotic end-effector movements that mirrors those of the user. However, due to this one-to-one mapping, the robot's motions are limited by the user's capability, particularly in translation. Drawing inspiration from head pointers utilized in the 1980s, originally designed to enable drawing with limited head motions for tetraplegic individuals, we proposed a "virtual wand" mapping which could be used by participants with reduced mobility. This mapping employs a virtual rigid linkage between the hand and the robot's end-effector. With this approach, rotations produce amplified translations through a lever arm, creating a "rotation-to-position" coupling and expanding the translation workspace at the expense of a reduced rotation space. In this study, we compare the virtual wand approach to the one-to-one position mapping through the realization of 6-DoF reaching tasks. Results indicate that the two different mappings perform comparably well, are equally well-received by users, and exhibit similar motor control behaviors. Nevertheless, the virtual wand mapping is anticipated to outperform in tasks characterized by large translations and minimal effector rotations, whereas direct mapping is expected to demonstrate advantages in large rotations with minimal translations. These results pave the way for new interactions and interfaces, particularly in disability assistance utilizing residual body movements (instead of hands) as control input. Leveraging body parts with substantial rotations could enable the accomplishment of tasks previously deemed infeasible with standard direct coupling interfaces.

### [A Novel Telelocomotion Framework with CoM Estimation for Scalable Locomotion on Humanoid Robots]()

Teleoperated humanoid robot systems have made substantial advancements in recent years, offering a physical avatar that harnesses human skills and decision-making while safeguarding users from hazardous environments. However, current telelocomotion interfaces often fail to accurately represent the robot's environment, limiting the user’s ability to effectively navigate the robot through unstructured terrain. This paper presents an initial telelocomotion framework that integrates the ForceBot locomotion interface with the small-sized humanoid robot, HECTOR V2. The framework utilizes ForceBot to simulate walking motion and estimate the user’s Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory, which serves as a tracking reference for the robot. On the robot side, a model predictive control (MPC) approach, based on a reduced-order single rigid body model, is employed to track the user’s scaled trajectory. We present experimental results on ForceBot’s CoM estimation and the robot’s tracking performance, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

### [Stiffness Regulation Co-Pilot in Bilateral Teleimpedance Control: A Preliminary User Study]()

Variable stiffness of a remote robot is crucial for a teleoperation system to deal with challenging tasks. External stiffness command interfaces have emerged as a promising solution to regulating the remote robot stiffness because of the benefits of their accuracy, ergonomics, and avoidance of the "coupling effect" that usually exists in muscle activity-based stiffness interfaces. However, the use of an external stiffness command interface requires good coordination between two limbs of an operator, which take care of the teleoperation task and the stiffness regulation task, respectively, at the same time, which is demanding for novice operators in dynamic situations necessitating agile and timely stiffness adjustments. In this paper, a new concept of Stiffness Regulation Co-pilot was proposed to facilitate the use of these interfaces. A co-pilot is a virtual agent that consists of a Stiffness Regulation Policy, which infers a reasonable stiffness regulation action from the task performance, and a feedback modality, which conveys the suggested stiffness regulation action to the operator. A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the co-pilot and the effect of different modalities of the co-pilot. The results showed that the cutaneous feedback or combined with another modality can potentially improve the task performance of the system and reduce the cognitive load of the operator compared to a teleoperation system without using the co-pilot.

### [Adaptive Neural Network Synchronous Tracking Control for Teleoperation Robots under Event-Triggered Mechanism]()

This paper proposes an adaptive neural network synchronous tracking control strategy that can be suitable for event-triggered mechanism in response to the modeling uncertainties and communication delays in bilateral teleoperation systems. Through introducing the event-triggered mechanism with the aim of reducing the network communication frequency in teleoperation system, the master and slave robots communicate with each other only when the triggering conditions are fulfilled, which enhances the efficiency of the network communication. This control strategy can guarantee the exponential convergence of the position synchronization tracking error of the master-slave robot end-effector. Moreover, the event-triggered conditions do not require any empirical design, but can be derived inversely with the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory. And the triggering time interval between two neighboring events is verified to be non-zero. It is demonstrated by utilizing the Lyapunov principle that the presented adaptive neural network control strategy ensures the final asymptotic convergence and exponential convergence of the position synchronization tracking error for master-slave robots under the designed event-triggered mechanisms. Eventually, the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control strategy are validated by comparative cases.

### [Learning Visuotactile Skills with Two Multifingered Hands]()

Aiming to replicate human-like dexterity, perceptual experiences, and motion patterns, we explore learning from human demonstrations using a bimanual system with multifingered hands and visuotactile data. Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning. Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data. Videos, code, and datasets can be found on: https://toruowo.github.io/hato

### [Learning Coordinated Bimanual Manipulation Policies Using State Diffusion and Inverse Dynamics Models]()

When performing tasks like laundry, humans naturally coordinate both hands to manipulate objects and anticipate how their actions will change the state of the clothes. However, achieving such coordination in robotics remains challenging due to the need to model object movement, predict future states, and generate precise bimanual actions. In this work, we address these challenges by infusing the predictive nature of human manipulation strategies into robot imitation learning. Specifically, we disentangle task-related state transitions from agent-specific inverse dynamics modeling to enable effective bimanual coordination. Using a demonstration dataset, we train a diffusion model to predict future states given historical observations, envisioning how the scene evolves. Then, we use an inverse dynamics model to compute robot actions that achieve the predicted states. Our key insight is that modeling object movement can help learning policies for bimanual coordination manipulation tasks. Evaluating our framework across diverse simulation and real-world manipulation setups, including multimodal goal configurations, bimanual manipulation, deformable objects, and multi-object setups, we find that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art state-to-action mapping policies. Our method demonstrates a remarkable capacity to navigate multimodal goal configurations and action distributions, maintain stability across different control modes, and synthesize a broader range of behaviors than those present in the demonstration dataset.

### [BiFold: Bimanual Cloth Folding with Language Guidance]()

Cloth folding is a complex task due to the inevitable self-occlusions of clothes, their complicated dynamics, and the disparate materials, geometries, and textures that garments can have. In this work, we learn folding actions conditioned on text commands. Translating high-level, abstract instructions into precise robotic actions requires sophisticated language understanding and manipulation capabilities. To do that, we leverage a pre-trained vision-language model and repurpose it to predict manipulation actions. Our model, BiFold, can take context into account and achieves stateof-the-art performance on an existing language-conditioned folding benchmark. To address the lack of annotated bimanual folding data, we introduce a novel dataset with automatically parsed actions and language-aligned instructions, enabling better learning of text-conditioned manipulation. BiFold attains the best performance on our dataset and demonstrates strong generalization to new instructions, garments, and environments.

### [One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning]()

We introduce One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning (ODIL), which enables dual-arm robots to learn precise and coordinated everyday tasks from just a single demonstration of the task. ODIL uses a new three-stage visual servoing (3-VS) method for precise alignment between the end-effector and target object, after which replay of the demonstration trajectory is sufficient to perform the task. This is achieved without requiring prior task or object knowledge, or additional data collection and training following the single demonstration. Furthermore, we propose a new dual-arm coordination paradigm for learning dual-arm tasks from a single demonstration. ODIL was tested on a real-world dual-arm robot, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six precise and coordinated tasks in both 4-DoF and 6-DoF settings, and showing robustness in the presence of distractor objects and partial occlusions.

### [In the Wild Ungraspable Object Picking with Bimanual Nonprehensile Manipulation]()

Picking diverse objects in the real world is a fundamental robotics skill. However, many objects in such settings are bulky, heavy, or irregularly shaped, making them ungraspable by conventional end effectors like suction grippers and parallel jaw grippers (PJGs). In this paper, we expand the range of pickable items without hardware modifications using bimanual nonprehensile manipulation. We focus on a grocery shopping scenario, where a bimanual mobile manipulator equipped with a suction gripper and a PJG is tasked with re- trieving ungraspable items from tightly packed grocery shelves. From visual observations, our method first identifies optimal grasp points based on force closure and friction constraints. If the grasp points are occluded, a series of nonprehensile nudging motions are performed to clear the obstruction. A bimanual grasp utilizing contacts on the side of the end effectors is then executed to grasp the target item. In our replica grocery store, we achieved a 90% success rate over 102 trials in uncluttered scenes, and a 66% success rate over 45 trials in cluttered scenes. We also deployed our system to a real-world grocery store and successfully picked previously unseen items. Our results highlight the potential of bimanual nonprehensile manipulation for in-the-wild robotic picking tasks. A video summarizing this work can be found at youtu.be/g0hOrDuK8jM

### [Bimanual Grasp Synthesis for Dexterous Robot Hands]()

Humans naturally perform bimanual skills to handle large and heavy objects. To enhance a robot's object manipulation capabilities, generating effective bimanual grasp poses is essential. Nevertheless, bimanual grasp synthesis for dexterous hand manipulators remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the BimanGrasp algorithm for synthesizing bimanual grasps on 3D objects. The BimanGrasp algorithm generates grasp poses by optimizing an energy function that considers grasp stability and feasibility. Furthermore, the quality of the synthesized grasps is verified using the Isaac Gym physics simulation engine. These verified grasp poses form the BimanGrasp-Dataset, which is the first synthesized bimanual dexterous hand grasp pose dataset to our knowledge. The dataset comprises over 150k verified grasps on 900 objects, facilitating the synthesis of bimanual grasps through a data-driven approach. Last, we propose a diffusion model (BimanGrasp-DDPM) trained on the BimanGrasp-Dataset. This model achieved a grasp synthesis success rate of 69.87% and significant acceleration in computational speed compared to BimanGrasp algorithm.

### [Efficient 7-DoF Grasp for Target-Driven Object in Dense Cluttered Scenes]()

Achieving a real-time precise grasp of a specified target object in densely cluttered environments is an essential capability for autonomous robot operation. Recently, considerable investigations on planar and spatial grasp have been carried out, and significant results have been obtained. However,these point cloud-based grasp prediction methods often fail to ensure that the generated grasp configurations meet the precise requirements of the task. Additionally, some of the existing grasp pipelines are too time-consuming to meet the demand for real-time robot response. In more challenging cluttered scenes,the quality of pose and gripper jaw opening estimation in highdimensional space requires further improvement. Therefore,this paper introduces a data- and model-independent and efficient method to generate 7-DoF grasp configurations for arbitrary target objects from single-view point cloud data in dense cluttered scenes. In addition, this paper proposes a grasp framework that generates the grasp configuration for the target object while reducing the time consumed during the grasp process, to enable robots to efficiently grasp target objects for designated tasks. The grasp pipeline focuses on guided regions via target detection and rapidly adjusts grasp configurations through multi-region point cloud distribution perception. Extensive real-world robot experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in grasping target objects in cluttered scenes, achieving higher success rates and reduced runtime compared to baseline methods.The realized code and video are available at https://github.com/L-tj/7DGCG.

### [Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters]()

In general, humans would grasp an object differently for different tasks, e.g., ``grasping the handle of a knife to cut'' vs. ``grasping the blade to hand over''. In the field of robotic grasp pose detection research, some existing works consider this task-oriented grasping and made some progress, but they are generally constrained by low-DoF gripper type or non-cluttered setting, which is not applicable for human assistance in real life. With an aim to get more general and practical grasp models, in this paper, we investigate a new problem named Task-Oriented 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection in Clutters (TO6DGC), which extends the task-oriented problem to a more general 6-DOF Grasp Pose Detection in Cluttered (multi-object) scenario. To this end, we construct a large-scale 6-DoF task-oriented grasping dataset, 6-DoF Task Grasp (6DTG), which features 4391 cluttered scenes with over 2 million 6-DoF grasp poses. Each grasp is annotated with a specific task, involving 6 tasks and 198 objects in total. Moreover, we propose One-Stage TaskGrasp (OSTG), a strong baseline to address the TO6DGC problem. Our OSTG adopts a task-oriented point selection strategy to detect where to grasp, and a task-oriented grasp generation module to decide how to grasp given a specific task. To evaluate the effectiveness of OSTG, extensive experiments are conducted on 6DTG. The results show that our method outperforms various baselines on multiple metrics. Real robot experiments also verify that our OSTG has a better perception of the task-oriented grasp points and 6-DoF grasp poses.

### [QuickGrasp: Lightweight Antipodal Grasp Planning with Point Clouds]()

Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final interface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become complicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the surroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods utilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure sampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning problem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization across domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the lack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic nature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application in real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach towards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to no sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp points on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector pose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for effective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An optimization-based quality metric is then used for evaluation of grasp points to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is compared with existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach Grasp pose detection (GPD) as baseline over multiple simulated objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated in real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned grasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator. The proposed approach shows better performance in terms of higher probability for force closure with a complete repeatability.

### [Behavioral Manifolds: Representing the Landscape of Grasp Affordances in Relative Pose Space]()

The use of machine learning to investigate grasp affordances has received extensive attention over the past several decades. The existing literature provides a robust basis to build upon, though a number of aspects may be improved. Results commonly work in terms of grasp configuration, with little consideration for the manner in which the grasp may be (re-)produced, from a reachability and trajectory planning perspective. We propose a different perspective on grasp affordance learning, explicitly accounting for grasp synthesis; that is, the manner in which manipulator kinematics are used to allow materialization of grasps. The approach allows to explicitly map the grasp policy space in terms of generated grasp types and associated grasp quality. Results of application to a range of objects illustrate merit of the method and highlight the manner in which it may promote a greater degree of explainability for otherwise intransparent reinforcement processes.

### [NeRF-Based Transparent Object Grasping Enhanced by Shape Priors]()

Transparent object grasping remains a persistent challenge in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of acquiring precise 3D information. Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF’s capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stable, and executable grasp predictions.

### [Center Direction Network for Grasping Point Localization on Cloths]()

Object grasping is a fundamental challenge in robotics and computer vision, critical for advancing robotic manipulation capabilities. Deformable objects, like fabrics and cloths, pose additional challenges due to their non-rigid nature. In this work, we introduce CeDiRNet-3DoF, a deep-learning model for grasp point detection, with a particular focus on cloth objects. CeDiRNet-3DoF employs center direction regression alongside a localization network, attaining first place in the perception task of ICRA 2023's Cloth Manipulation Challenge. Recognizing the lack of standardized benchmarks in the literature that hinder effective method comparison, we present the ViCoS Towel Dataset. This extensive benchmark dataset comprises 8,000 real and 12,000 synthetic images, serving as a robust resource for training and evaluating contemporary data-driven deep-learning approaches. Extensive evaluation revealed CeDiRNet-3DoF's robustness in real-world performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, including the latest transformer-based models. Our work bridges a crucial gap, offering a robust solution and benchmark for cloth grasping in computer vision and robotics.

### [How Safe Is Particle Filtering-Based Localization for Mobile Robots? an Integrity Monitoring Approach]()

Deriving safe bounds on particle filter estimate is a research problem that, if solved, could greatly benefit robots in life-critical applications, a field that is facing increasing interest as more robots are being deployed near humans. In response, this paper introduces a new fault detector and derives a performance measure for particle filter: integrity risk. Integrity risk is defined as the probability of having large estimate errors without triggering an alarm, all while considering measurement faults, unknown deterministic errors that cannot be modeled via normal white noise. In this work, the faults come in the form of incorrectly associated features when using the local nearest neighbors. Simulations and experiments assess the efficiency of the introduced safety metric. The results show that safety improves as map density increases as long as the number of particles is sufficient to shape the error distribution and the landmarks are well separated. Also, the results indicate that, when landmarks are poorly separated, particle filter is safer than Kalman filter, whereas, when landmarks are well separated, particle filter is often, but not always, safer than Kalman filter.

### [Lighthouse Localization of Miniature Wireless Robots]()

In this paper, we apply lighthouse localization, originally designed for virtual reality motion tracking, to positioning and localization of indoor robots. We first present a lighthouse decoding and tracking algorithm on a low-power wireless microcontroller with hardware implemented in a cm-scale form factor. One-time scene solving is performed on a computer using a variety of standard computer vision tech-niques. Three different robotic localization scenarios are analyzed in this work. The first is a planar scene with a single lighthouse with a four-point pre-calibration. The second is a planar scene with two light-houses that self calibrates with either multiple robots in the experiment or a single robot in motion. The third extends to a 3D scene with two lighthouses and a self-calibration algorithm. The absolute accuracy, measured against a camera-based tracking system, was found to be 7.25 mm RMS for the 2D case and 11.2 mm RMS for the 3D case, respectively. This demonstrates the viability of lighthouse tracking both for small-scale robotics and as an inexpensive and compact alternative to camera-based setups.

### [EVLoc: Event-Based Visual Localization in LiDAR Maps Via Event-Depth Registration]()

Event cameras are bioinspired sensors with some notable features, including high dynamic range and low latency, which makes them exceptionally suitable for perception in challenging scenarios such as high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To facilitate future research, both the code and the pre-trained models are made available online.

### [MambaGlue: Fast and Robust Local Feature Matching with Mamba]()

In recent years, robust matching methods using deep learning-based approaches have been actively studied and improved in computer vision tasks. However, there remains a persistent demand for both robust and fast matching techniques. To address this, we propose a novel Mamba-based local feature matching approach, called MambaGlue, where Mamba is an emerging state-of-the-art architecture rapidly gaining recognition for its superior speed in both training and inference, and promising performance compared with Transformer architectures. In particular, we propose two modules: a) MambaAttention mixer to simultaneously and selectively understand the local and global context through the Mamba-based self-attention structure and b) deep confidence score regressor, which is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture that evaluates a score indicating how confidently matching predictions correspond to the ground-truth correspondences. Consequently, our MambaGlue achieves a balance between robustness and efficiency in real-world applications. As verified on various public datasets, we demonstrate that our MambaGlue yields a substantial performance improvement over baseline approaches while maintaining fast inference speed. Our code will be available on https://github.com/url-kaist/MambaGlue.

### [ULOC: Learning to Localize in Complex Large-Scale Environments with Ultra-Wideband Ranges]()

While UWB-based methods can achieve high localization accuracy in small-scale areas, their accuracy and reliability are significantly challenged in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) based localization in such complex large-scale environments, named ULOC. First, anchors are deployed in the environment without knowledge of their actual position. Then, UWB observations are collected when the vehicle travels in the environment. At the same time, map-consistent pose estimates are developed from registering (onboard self-localization) data with the prior map to provide the training labels. We then propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on MAMBA that learns the ranging patterns of UWBs over a complex large-scale environment. The experiment demonstrates that our solution can ensure high localization accuracy on a large scale compared to the state-of-the-art. We release our source code to benefit the community at https://github.com/brytsknguyen/uloc.

### [Indoor Localization of UAVs Using Only Few Measurements by Output-Sensitive Preimage Intersection]()

We present a deterministic approach for the localization of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a known indoor environment by using only a few downward distance measurements and the corresponding odometries between measurements. For each distance measurement and odometry, we look at the preimage of that distance measurement under the downwards distance function combined with the corresponding odometry where the motion between every two measurements has four degrees of freedom: three of translation and one of azimuth change. The intersection of these preimages yields the set of all possible locations for the UAV. In this work, we present an efficient method for approximating that intersection of preimages. We perform a spatial subdivision search, which splits only voxels containing that intersection. We present a novel technique, based on geometric insights, for correctly evaluating whether a voxel indeed contains a true localization. This technique is also robust under different kinds of errors that might occur. Our method is guaranteed to contain the ground truth location, and its runtime complexity is output sensitive, in the Hausdorff dimension and measure of the resulting intersection of preimages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in various indoor scenarios, showing that it can be used to significantly decrease the uncertainty of localization when solving the kidnapped robot problem in simulation and on a physical drone. Our method can be performed in real-time. Furthermore, our method requires only a map of the environment, odometry and ToF sensors, which is advantageous in terms of cost, privacy and transmission bandwidth. Our open-source software and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/TAU-CGL/uav-fdml-public.

### [Motion Comparator: Visual Comparison of Robot Motions]()

Roboticists compare robot motions for tasks such as parameter tuning, troubleshooting, and deciding between possible motions. However, most existing visualization tools are designed for individual motions and lack the features necessary to facilitate robot motion comparison. In this paper, we follow a rigorous design process to create Motion Comparator, a web-based tool that facilitates the comprehension, comparison, and communication of robot motions. Our design process identified roboticists' needs, articulated design challenges, and provided corresponding strategies. Motion Comparator includes several key features such as multi-view coordination, quaternion visualization, time warping, and comparative designs. To demonstrate the applications of Motion Comparator, we discuss four case studies in which our tool is used for motion selection, troubleshooting, parameter tuning, and motion review.

### [Text2Robot: Evolutionary Robot Design from Text Descriptions]()

Robot design has traditionally been costly and labor-intensive. Despite advancements in automated processes, it remains challenging to navigate a vast design space while producing physically manufacturable robots. We introduce Text2Robot, a framework that converts user text specifications and performance preferences into physical quadrupedal robots. Within minutes, Text2Robot can use text-to-3D models to provide strong initializations of diverse morphologies. Within a day, our geometric processing algorithms and body-control co-optimization produce a walking robot by explicitly considering real-world electronics and manufacturability. Text2Robot enables rapid prototyping and opens new opportunities for robot design with generative models.

### [QueryCAD: Grounded Question Answering for CAD Models]()

CAD models are widely used in industry and are essential for robotic automation processes. However, these models are rarely considered in novel AI-based approaches, such as the automatic synthesis of robot programs, as there are no readily available methods that would allow CAD models to be incorporated for the analysis, interpretation, or extraction of information. To address these limitations, we propose QueryCAD, the first system designed for CAD question answering, enabling the extraction of precise information from CAD models using natural language queries. QueryCAD incorporates SegCAD, an open-vocabulary instance segmentation model we developed to identify and select specific parts of the CAD model based on part descriptions. We further propose a CAD question answering benchmark to evaluate QueryCAD and establish a foundation for future research. Lastly, we integrate QueryCAD within an automatic robot program synthesis framework, validating its ability to enhance deep-learning solutions for robotics by enabling them to process CAD models.

### [HeRo: A State Machine-Based, Fault-Tolerant Framework for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Collaboration]()

Heterogeneous robots can work together to accomplish a variety of complex tasks and have shown great potential in many fields. There are many efforts to make robot task orchestration more efficient. However, current methods still have some limitations, including the lack of a high-level abstraction for programming method and fault handling mechanism. In this paper, we design a state machine-based, fault-tolerant framework for heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration named HeRo, to effectively support the development of heterogeneous multi-robot systems. HeRo has three key techniques: (1) a state machine-based programming language to flexibly model robot behaviors and tasks; (2) a state synchronization mechanism to achieve information exchange and maintain the consistency among heterogeneous robots in distributed environments; (3) a fault detection and recovery mechanism to monitor the system's runtime states and use Large Language Model (LLM) combined with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to enable automated recovery. We evaluate the effectiveness and fault recovery capability of the framework by setting up manufacturing task and fault scenarios with varying difficulty in the ARIAC simulation environment, achieving a 100% task completion rate, with low system overhead and flexible scalability.

### [A Kinematics Optimization Framework with Improved Computational Efficiency for Task-Based Optimum Design of Serial Manipulators in Cluttered Environments]()

It is challenging to find optimum kinematic designs for non-standard robotic manipulators, e.g., medical, nuclear, and space manipulators, which are demanded to adapt to arbitrary complex tasks in constraints. Such design optimization can be modelled as a multi-dimensional non-convex optimization problem with nonlinear constrained conditions. However, it is non-trivial to ensure the essential reachability condition, i.e., the existence of continuous trajectories between demand positions for serial articulated manipulators, given complex spatial constraints, like obstacles and boundaries. Traditional solutions integrate standard motion planning or inverse kinematics algorithms within a kinematic-design optimization process, resulting in significant demand for time and computing resources. To accelerate design optimization at improved efficiency, we design a novel robust design framework built on a new kinematic design synthesis, which allows for simultaneously optimizing dimension and topology of a serial manipulator's kinematics for arbitrary tasks in constrained environments, using a generalised parametric kinematic model. Significantly, in contrast to standard solutions, we develop a novel computationally effective reachability verification method, which rapidly aborts infeasible motions by exploiting efficient collision checks, based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed design framework is verified and evaluated by comparing to baseline benchmarks. Results demonstrate the novel design framework can accelerate kinematic design optimization by an order of magnitude compared to the current state-of-the-art, and optimise link dimension and joint type simultaneously of serial robots for cluttered environments.

### [A Survey on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms]()

Connected and automated vehicles and robot swarms hold transformative potential for enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability in the transportation and manufacturing sectors. Extensive testing and validation of these technologies is crucial for their deployment in the real world. While simulations are essential for initial testing, they often have limitations in capturing the complex dynamics of real-world interactions. This limitation underscores the importance of small-scale testbeds. These testbeds provide a realistic, cost-effective, and controlled environment for testing and validating algorithms, acting as an essential intermediary between simulation and full-scale experiments. This work serves to facilitate researchers' efforts in identifying existing small-scale testbeds suitable for their experiments and provide insights for those who want to build their own. In addition, it delivers a comprehensive survey of the current landscape of these testbeds. We derive 62 characteristics of testbeds based on the well-known sense-plan-act paradigm and offer an online table comparing 23 small-scale testbeds based on these characteristics. The online table is hosted on our designated public webpage https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey, and we invite testbed creators and developers to contribute to it. We closely examine nine testbeds in this paper, demonstrating how the derived characteristics can be used to present testbeds. Furthermore, we discuss three ongoing ch

### [ACROSS: A Deformation-Based Cross-Modal Representation for Robotic Tactile Perception]()

Tactile perception is essential for human interaction with the environment and is becoming increasingly crucial in robotics. Tactile sensors like the BioTac mimic human fingertips and provide detailed interaction data. Despite its utility in applications like slip detection and object identification, this sensor is now deprecated, making many valuable datasets obsolete. However, recreating similar datasets with newer sensor technologies is both tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, adapting these existing datasets for use with new setups and modalities is crucial. In response, we introduce ACROSS, a novel framework for translating data between tactile sensors by exploiting sensor deformation information. We demonstrate the approach by translating BioTac signals into the DIGIT sensor. Our framework consists of first converting the input signals into 3D deformation meshes. We then transition from the 3D deformation mesh of one sensor to the mesh of another, and finally convert the generated 3D deformation mesh into the corresponding output space. We demonstrate our approach to the most challenging problem of going from a low-dimensional tactile representation to a high-dimensional one. In particular, we transfer the tactile signals of a BioTac sensor to DIGIT tactile images. Our approach enables the continued use of valuable datasets and data exchange between groups with different setups.

### [Learning to Double Guess: An Active Perception Approach for Estimating the Center of Mass of Arbitrary Object]()

Manipulating arbitrary objects in unstructured environments is a significant challenge in robotics, primarily due to difficulties in determining an object's center of mass. This paper introduces U-GRAPH: Uncertainty-Guided Rotational Active Perception with Haptics, a novel framework to enhance the center of mass estimation using active perception. Traditional methods often rely on singular interactions and are limited by the inherent inaccuracies of Force-Torque (F/T) sensors. Our approach circumvents these limitations by integrating a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to quantify uncertainty and guide the robotic system through multiple, information-rich interactions via grid search and ActiveNet. We demonstrate the remarkable generalizability and transferability of our method with training on a small dataset with limited variation yet still perform well on unseen complex real-world objects.

### [Learning In-Hand Translation Using Tactile Skin with Shear and Normal Force Sensing]()

Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) and tactile sensing has significantly advanced dexterous manipulation. However, these methods often utilize simplified tactile signals due to the gap between tactile simulation and the real world. We introduce a sensor model for tactile skin that enables zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of ternary shear and binary normal forces. Using this model, we develop an RL policy that leverages sliding contact for dexterous in-hand translation. We conduct extensive real-world experiments to assess how tactile sensing facilitates policy adaptation to various unseen object properties and robot hand orientations. We demonstrate that our 3-axis tactile policies consistently outperform baselines that use only shear forces, only normal forces, or only proprioception. Videos and details available on the project website.

### [Contrastive Touch-To-Touch Pretraining]()

Tactile sensors differ greatly in design, making it challenging to develop general-purpose methods for processing tactile feedback. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive self-supervised learning approach that represents tactile feedback across different sensor types. Our method utilizes paired tactile data—where two distinct sensors, in our case Soft Bubbles and GelSlims, grasp the same object in the same configuration—to learn a unified latent representation. Unlike current approaches that focus on reconstruction or task-specific supervision, our method employs contrastive learning to create a latent space that captures shared information between sensors. By treating paired tactile signals as positives and unpaired signals as negatives, we show that our model effectively learns a rich, sensor-agnostic representation. Despite significant differences between Soft Bubble and GelSlim sensors, the learned representation enables strong downstream task performance, including zero-shot and few-shot classification and pose estimation. This work provides a scalable solution for integrating tactile data across diverse sensor modalities, advancing the development of generalizable tactile representations.

### [ViTract: Robust Object Shape Perception Via Active Visuo-Tactile Interaction]()

An essential problem in robotic systems that are to be deployed in unstructured environments is the accurate and autonomous perception of the shapes of previously unseen objects. Existing methods for shape estimation or reconstruction have leveraged either visual or tactile interactive exploration techniques, or have relied on comprehensive visual or tactile information acquired in an offline manner. In this work, a novel visuo-tactile interactive perception framework - ViTract is introduced for shape estimation of unseen objects. Our framework estimates the shape of diverse objects robustly using low-dimensional, efficient, and generalizable shape primitives, which are superquadrics. The probabilistic formulation within our framework takes advantage of the complementary information provided by vision and tactile observations while accounting for associated noise. As part of our framework, we propose a novel modality-specific information gain to select the most informative and reliable exploratory action (using vision/tactile) to obtain iterative visuo/tactile information. Our real-robot experiments demonstrate superior and robust performance compared to state-of-the-art visuo-tactile-based shape estimation techniques.

### [Location and Orientation Super-Resolution Sensing with a Cost-Efficient and Repairable Barometric Tactile Sensor]()

The adoption of tactile sensors in robotics is hindered by their high cost and fragility. We designed and validated a cost-effective and robust barometric tactile sensor array, whose material cost is below 80 USD. Unlike past work, we do not mold the rubber surface over the barometers but instead keep it as a separate element, leading to a design that is easy to fabricate and repair. Machine learning techniques are applied to enhance the sensor’s localization precision, increasing the effective resolution from 6 mm (the distance between adjacent barometers) to 0.284 mm. To investigate the localization model’s robustness, we utilized an E-TRoll robotic gripper to roll differently shaped prismatic objects across the sensing surface mounted on one finger. Under these uncontrolled settings, we achieved a satisfactory real-time localization resolution of within 2.68 mm. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel practical application: The E-TRoll mimics a 1-DoF parallel gripper inferring a cube’s orientation relative to the sensor. The range of orientations is split into 4 classes, which a trained CNN-LSTM model can predict with an 86.91% five-fold cross-validated accuracy.

### [Person Re-Identification for Robot Person Following with Online Continual Learning]()

Robot person following (RPF) is a crucial capability in human-robot interaction (HRI) applications, allowing a robot to persistently follow a designated person. In practical RPF scenarios, the person can often be occluded by other objects or people. Consequently, it is necessary to re-identify the person when he/she reappears within the robot's field of view. Previous person re-identification (ReID) approaches to person following rely on a fixed feature extractor. Such an approach often fails to generalize to different viewpoints and lighting conditions in practical RPF environments. In other words, it suffers from the so-called domain shift problem where it cannot re-identify the person when his re-appearance is out of the domain modeled by the fixed feature extractor. To mitigate this problem, we propose a ReID framework for RPF where we use a feature extractor that is optimized online with both short-term and long-term experiences (i.e., recently and previously observed samples during RPF) using the online continual learning (OCL) framework. The long-term experiences are maintained by a memory manager to enable OCL to update the feature extractor. Our experiments demonstrate that even in the presence of severe appearance changes and distractions from visually similar people, the proposed method can still re-identify the person more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods.

### [HelmetPoser: A Helmet-Mounted IMU Dataset for Data-Driven Estimation of Human Head Motion in Diverse Conditions]()

Helmet-mounted wearable positioning systems are crucial for enhancing safety and facilitating coordination in industrial, construction, and emergency rescue environments. These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

### [Relevance-Driven Decision Making for Safer and More Efficient Human Robot Collaboration]()

Human brain possesses the ability to effectively focus on important environmental components, which enhances perception, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, we introduced a novel concept termed relevance for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Relevance is a dimensionality reduction process that incorporates a continuously operating perception module, evaluates cue sufficiency within the scene, and applies a flexible formulation and computation framework. In this paper, we present an enhanced two-loop framework that integrates real-time and asynchronous processing to quantify relevance and leverage it for safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC). The two-loop framework integrates an asynchronous loop, which leverages an LLM’s world knowledge to quantify relevance, and a real-time loop, which performs scene understanding, human intent prediction, and decision-making based on relevance. HRC decision-making is enhanced by a relevance-based task allocation method, as well as a motion generation and collision avoidance approach that incorporates human trajectory prediction. Simulations and experiments show that our methodology for relevance quantification can accurately and robustly predict the human objective and relevance, with an average accuracy of up to 0.90 for objective prediction and up to 0.96 for relevance prediction. Moreover, our motion generation methodology reduces collision cases by 63.76% and collision frames by 44.74% when compared with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) collision avoidance method. Our framework and methodologies, with relevance, guide the robot on how to best assist humans and generate safer and more efficient actions for HRC.

### [Back to the Cartesian: Pilot Study for Assessing Human Stiffness in 3D Cartesian Space by Transforming from Muscle Space in a Peg-In-Hole Scenario for Tele-Impedance]()

For various teleoperation tasks, position-based control is not practical. An impedance-based control is superior e.g. for handling fragile objects, like harvesting fruits or grasping a paper cup. However, only a few researchers have focused on impedance control for teleoperation. In tele-impedance, the stiffness of a human is measured and transferred to a controller of a robot. Until now, human stiffness was mostly measured either for specific joints or in 2D Cartesian space. We introduce a new way of measuring Cartesian stiffness in 3D using electromyography. Users were asked to perform a peg-in-hole task in three different orientations (0°, 45°, 90°). Meanwhile, electromyography measurements at shoulder and elbow muscle groups are performed. In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that the measured stiffness matrix in Cartesian space differed significantly across the three differently oriented peg-in-hole scenarios. This demonstrates that human stiffness could be predicted in 3D Cartesian space based on the type of task at hand.

### [Systematic Comparison of Projection Methods for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation on Fisheye Images]()

Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel FISHnCHIPS dataset, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses.

### [HuMAn – the Human Motion Anticipation Algorithm Based on Recurrent Neural Networks]()

Predicting human motion may lead to considerable advantages for human-robot interaction, particularly when precise synchronization between the robot’s motion and the user’s movement is imperative. The inherent stochastic nature of human behavior, combined with the restricted window of response, can give rise to residual and undesirable forces during interactions, potentially harming the user. Therefore, efficient prediction of human joint movements may enhance the performance of various interaction control frameworks used in wearable robots. This paper proposes the HuMAn algorithm for predicting human joint motion based on a recurrent neural network. This algorithm consists of a long-term memory network, used to interpret sequences of poses, and a prediction layer, employed to build the most likely future user poses within a specified time horizon. Network training was performed using datasets encompassing various subjects and types of motion. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as evidenced by average general prediction errors below 0.1 radians for predictive horizons of up to 500 milliseconds. Furthermore, a mean absolute error of 0.026 radians was achieved for a periodic treadmill walk. Simulation results demonstrate a large improvement in transparency control performance in a case study with an upper limb exoskeleton robot.

### [Robotic-CLIP: Fine-Tuning CLIP on Action Data for Robotic Applications]()

Vision language models have played a key role in extracting meaningful features for various robotic applications. Among these, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is widely used in robotic tasks that require both vision and natural language understanding. However, CLIP was trained solely on static images paired with text prompts and has not yet been fully adapted for robotic tasks involving dynamic actions. In this paper, we introduce Robotic-CLIP to enhance robotic perception capabilities. We first gather and label large-scale action data, and then build our Robotic-CLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on 309,433 videos (~7.4 million frames) of action data using contrastive learning. By leveraging action data, Robotic-CLIP inherits CLIP's strong image performance while gaining the ability to understand actions in robotic contexts. Intensive experiments show that our Robotic-CLIP outperforms other CLIP-based models across various language-driven robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Robotic-CLIP in real-world grasping applications.

### [In-Context Imitation Learning Via Next-Token Prediction]()

In-context imitation learning is the capability to perform novel tasks when prompted with task demonstration examples. In-Context Robot Transformer (ICRT) is a causal transformer that performs autoregressive prediction on sensorimotor trajectories, which include images, proprioceptive states, and actions. This approach supports flexible and trainingfree execution of new tasks at test time. Experiments with a Franka Emika robot demonstrate that ICRT can adapt to new environment configurations that differ from both the prompt and the training data. In a multi-task environment setup, ICRT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art robot foundation models on generalization to unseen tasks. Code, data, and appendix are available on https://icrt.dev.

### [Data Augmentation for NeRFs in the Low Data Limit]()

Current methods based on Neural Radiance Fields fail in the low data limit, particularly when training on incomplete scene data. Prior works augment training data only in next-best-view applications, which lead to hallucinations and model collapse with sparse data. In contrast, we propose adding a set of views during training by rejection sampling from a posterior uncertainty distribution, generated by combining a volumetric uncertainty estimator with spatial coverage. We validate our results on partially observed scenes; on average, our method performs 39.9% better with 87.5% less variability across established scene reconstruction benchmarks, as compared to state of the art baselines. We further demonstrate that augmenting the training set by sampling from any distribution leads to better, more consistent scene reconstruction in sparse environments. This work is foundational for robotic tasks where augmenting a dataset with informative data is critical in resource-constrained, a priori unknown environments. Videos and source code are available at https://murpheylab.github.io/low-data-nerf .

### [Generalizable Imitation Learning through Pre-Trained Representations]()

In this paper, we leverage self-supervised vision transformer models and their emergent semantic abilities to improve the generalization abilities of imitation learning policies. We introduce DVK, an imitation learning algorithm that leverages rich pre-trained Visual Transformer patch-level embeddings to obtain better generalization when learning through demonstrations. Our learner sees the world by clustering appearance features into groups associated with semantic concepts, forming stable keypoints that generalize across a wide range of appearance variations and object types. We demonstrate how this representation enables generalized behaviour by evaluating imitation learning across a diverse dataset of object manipulation tasks. To facilitate further study of generalization in Imitation Learning, all of our code for the method and evaluation, as well as the dataset, is made available.

### [Beyond Sight: Finetuning Generalist Robot Policies with Heterogeneous Sensors Via Language Grounding]()

Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSe is able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.

### [Simultaneous Geometry and Pose Estimation of Held Objects Via 3D Foundation Models]()

Humans have the remarkable ability to use held objects as tools to interact with their environment. For this to occur, humans internally estimate how hand movements affect the object's movement. We wish to endow robots with this capability. We contribute methodology to jointly estimate the geometry and pose of objects grasped by a robot, from RGB images captured by an external camera. Notably, our method transforms the estimated geometry into the robot's coordinate frame, while not requiring the extrinsic parameters of the external camera to be calibrated. Our approach leverages 3D foundation models, large models pre-trained on huge datasets for 3D vision tasks, to produce initial estimates of the in-hand object. These initial estimations do not have physically correct scales and are in the camera's frame. Then, we formulate, and efficiently solve, a coordinate-alignment problem to recover accurate scales, along with a transformation of the objects to the coordinate frame of the robot. Forward kinematics mappings can subsequently be defined from the manipulator's joint angles to specified points on the object. These mappings enable the estimation of points on the held object at arbitrary configurations, enabling robot motion to be designed with respect to coordinates on the grasped objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a robot manipulator holding a diverse set of real-world objects.

### [Gradient Descent-Based Task-Orientation Robot Control Enhanced with Gaussian Process Predictions]()

This paper proposes a novel force-based task-orientation controller for interaction tasks with environmental orientation uncertainties. The main aim of the controller is to align the robot tool along the main task direction (e.g., along screwing, insertion, polishing, etc.) without the use of any external sensors (e.g., vision systems), relying only on end-effector wrench measurements/estimations. We propose a gradient descent-based orientation controller, enhancing its performance with the orientation predictions provided by a Gaussian Process model. Derivation of the controller is presented, together with simulation results (considering a probing task) and experimental results involving various re-orientation scenarios, i.e., i) a task with the robot in interaction with a soft environment, ii) a task with the robot in interaction with a stiff and inclined environment, and iii) a task to enable the assembly of a gear into its shaft. The proposed controller is compared against a state-of-the-art approach, highlighting its ability to re-orient the robot tool even in complex tasks (where the state-of-the-art method fails).

### [Model-Free Inverse H-Infinity Control for Imitation Learning (I)]()

This paper proposes a data-driven model-free inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm tailored for solving an inverse H_infty control problem. In the problem, both an expert and a learner engage in H_infty control to reject disturbances and the learner's objective is to imitate the expert's behavior by reconstructing the expert's performance function through IRL techniques. Introducing zero-sum game principles, we first formulate a model-based single-loop IRL policy iteration algorithm that includes three key steps: updating the policy, action, and performance function using a new correction formula and the standard inverse optimal control principles. Building upon the model-based approach, we propose a model-free single-loop off-policy IRL algorithm that eliminates the need for initial stabilizing policies and prior knowledge of the dynamics of expert and learner. Also, we provide rigorous proof of convergence, stability, and Nash optimality to guarantee the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we showcase the efficiency of our algorithm through simulations and experiments, highlighting its advantages compared to the existing methods.

### [Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception Via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction]()

Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception — the robot’s internal sensing capabilities — and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.

### [Reservoir Computing Encodes Physical Adaptations for Reinforcement Learning]()

Adapting reinforcement learning (RL) policies to various robot body configurations is a significant challenge for creating flexible autonomous systems. This study presents a novel framework that integrates Reservoir Computing (RC) with the First-Order Reduced and Controlled Error (FORCE) learning rule to enhance policy adaptability in RL. The RC serves as a dynamic feature extractor, capturing temporal dependencies by pre-training on state transitions generated through random actions. This pre-training acts as regularization, reducing variance and preventing overfitting to specific configurations Subsequently, the control policy network is trained on a limited set of body variations using the enriched features from the RC. Experimental results across three distinct environments demonstrate that the proposed RC+FORCE framework significantly improves policy performance and adaptability to unseen robot configurations compared to traditional reinforcement learning through domain randomization. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining RC-based feature extraction with FORCE-based training in developing robust RL agents.

### [Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for All-Layer DNN-Based Adaptive Control with Stability Guarantees]()

A critical goal of adaptive control is enabling robots to rapidly adapt in dynamic environments. Recent studies have developed a meta-learning-based adaptive control scheme, which uses meta-learning to extract nonlinear features (represented by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)) from offline data, and uses adaptive control to update linear coefficients online. However, such a scheme is fundamentally limited by the linear parameterization of uncertainties and does not fully unleash the capability of DNNs. This paper introduces a novel learning-based adaptive control framework that pretrains a DNN via self-supervised meta-learning (SSML) from offline trajectories and online adapts the full DNN via composite adaptation. In particular, the offline SSML stage leverages the time consistency in trajectory data to train the DNN to predict future disturbances from history, in a self-supervised manner without environment condition labels. The online stage carefully designs a control law and an adaptation law to update the full DNN with stability guarantees. Empirically, the proposed framework significantly outperforms (19-39%) various classic and learning-based adaptive control baselines, in challenging real-world quadrotor tracking problems under large dynamic wind disturbance.

### [Residual Policy Learning for Perceptive Quadruped Control Using Differentiable Simulation]()

First-order Policy Gradient (FoPG) algorithms such as Backpropagation through Time and Analytical Policy Gradients leverage local simulation physics to accelerate policy search, significantly improving sample efficiency in robot control compared to standard model-free reinforcement learning. However, FoPG algorithms can exhibit poor learning dynamics in contact-rich tasks like locomotion. Previous approaches address this issue by alleviating contact dynamics via algorithmic or simulation innovations. In contrast, we propose guiding the policy search by learning a residual over a simple baseline policy. For quadruped locomotion, we find that the role of residual policy learning in FoPG-based training (FoPG RPL) is primarily to improve asymptotic rewards, compared to improving sample efficiency for model-free RL. Additionally, we provide insights on applying FoPG's to pixel-based local navigation, training a point-mass robot to convergence within seconds. Finally, we showcase the versatility of FoPG RPL by using it to train locomotion and perceptive navigation end-to-end on a quadruped in minutes.

### [METDrive: Multimodal End-To-End Autonomous Driving with Temporal Guidance]()

Multimodal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system’s understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.

### [Generalizing Motion Planners with Mixture of Experts for Autonomous Driving]()

Large real-world driving datasets have sparked significant research into various aspects of learning-based motion planners for autonomous driving. These include data augmentation, model architecture, reward design, training strategies, and planner pipelines. In this paper, we review and benchmark previous methods. Experiments show that many of these approaches have limited generalization abilities in planning performance due to overly complex designs or training paradigms. Experiments further reveal that as models are appropriately scaled, many designs become redundant. Therefore, we introduce StateTransformer-2 (STR2), a scalable, decoder-only motion planner. STR2uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a mix-of-experts (MoE) causal transformer architecture. The MoE backbone addresses modality collapse and reward balancing by expert routing during training. Extensive experiments on the NuPlan dataset show that our method generalizes better than previous approaches across different test sets and closed-loop simulations. We evaluate its scalability on billions of real-world urban driving scenarios, demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements as both data and model size grow.

### [Low-Rank Adaptation-Based All-Weather Removal for Autonomous Navigation]()

All-weather image restoration (AWIR) is crucial for reliable autonomous navigation under adverse weather conditions. AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

### [Stands on Shoulders of Giants: Learning to Lift 2D Detection to 3D with Geometry-Driven Objectives]()

3D detection of vehicles is an essential component for autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, collecting the supervised training data for learning 3D vehicle detectors would be costly (e.g. utilization of expensive LiDAR sensors) and labor-intensive (for human annotation). In comparison to 3D detection, 2D object detection has achieved a well-developed status, boosting stable and robust performance with widespread application in numerous fields, thanks to the large scale (i.e. amount of samples) of existing training datasets of 2D object detection. Hence, in our work, we propose to realize 3D detection via leveraging the robustness of 2D detectors and developing a network that lifts 2D detections to 3D. With the flexibility of building upon various backbone models (e.g. the models which take image regions detected by 2D detector as inputs to predict their corresponding 3D bounding boxes, or the existing monocular 3D detection models which have the intermediate output of 2D bounding boxes), we propose several geometry-driven objectives, including projection consistency loss, geometry depth loss, and opposite bin loss, to improve the training upon 2D-to-3D lifting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed geometry-driven objectives not only contribute to the superior results of 3D detection but also provide better generalizability across datasets.

### [LidarDM: Generative LiDAR Simulation in a Generated World]()

We present LidarDM, a novel LiDAR generative model capable of producing realistic, layout-aware, physically plausible, and temporally coherent LiDAR videos. LidarDM stands out with two unprecedented capabilities in LiDAR generative modeling: (i) LiDAR generation guided by driving scenarios, offering significant potential for autonomous driving simulations, and (ii) 4D LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling the creation of realistic and temporally coherent sequences. At the heart of our model is a novel integrated 4D world generation framework. Specifically, we employ latent diffusion models to generate the 3D scene, combine it with dynamic actors to form the underlying 4D world, and subsequently produce realistic sensory observations within this virtual environment. Our experiments indicate that our approach outperforms competing algorithms in realism, temporal coherency, and layout consistency. We additionally show that LidarDM can be used as a generative world model simulator for training and testing perception models.

### [RenderWorld: World Model with Self-Supervised 3D Label]()

End-to-end autonomous driving with vision-only is not only more cost-effective compared to LiDAR-vision fusion but also more reliable than traditional methods. To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and use world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, lead- ing to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.

### [Dynamic Spring-Charging Locomotion Enabled by Mechanical Intelligence]()

Repetitive subtasks of locomotion are offloaded from a conventional computer-actuator-sensor set-up to automatic mechanical processes. The subtasks considered are: (1) when out-of-contact with the environment, move a leg to a ready position in preparation for contact, and (2) when contact is detected, push off the ground. Using conventional closed loop control, subtask (1) would be accomplished by programming logic and a feedback loop onto a computer- motor-encoder system, and subtask (2) would be accomplished by sensing contact, then commanding the leg motor to push- off via programmed computer logic. We demonstrate how to transition this programmed logic from a computer processor to a mechanical processor. The mechanical processor as an example of mechanical intelligence performs preprogrammed actions based on combinations of components states, some of which are internal and some that interact with the environment. Because signals are not digital, but rather mechanical quantities of energy, position, and force; transitioning to a mechanical processor enables a third subtask not possible by the computer alone: that is, (3) the accumulation of elastic energy while out-of-contact with the environment, and its automatic release upon contact for a more powerful push-off motion. Migrating processing out of the computer allows for faster responses to dynamic events, and instantiates a high-powered reflex triggered by ground contact.

### [Deep Learning-Based End-To-End Framework for Unified Locomotion on Powered Prostheses]()

We present an end-to-end control framework for powered prostheses using temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to map onboard sensor inputs directly to torque and position outputs. Unlike traditional hierarchical controllers that require extensive manual tuning, our approach offers a user-independent, deep learning-based solution for dynamic locomotion. Using data from 17 participants across five walking modes (i.e. level-ground, ramps, stairs), we trained two TCN models, validated via leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Our models achieved torque RMSEs of 0.126 Nm/kg at the ankle and 0.348 Nm/kg at the knee, and position RMSEs of 2.87° and 5.64°, respectively. Corresponding R² values were 0.56 (ankle) and 0.54 (knee) for the torque model, and 0.66 (ankle) and 0.87 (knee) for the position model. The results suggest that TCNs can replicate impedance-based control outputs, taking a step closer to real-world deployability of powered prostheses.

### [A Wheel-Gripper: Multifunctional End-Effector for Wheel-Legged Robots]()

Manipulation with legs on multi-pedal robots is not a new concept, but it has rarely been considered on wheel-legged robots due to their mechanical structure. This paper presents a mechanism that transitions between a wheel and a gripper, allowing wheel-legged robots to perform manipulation tasks with their legs. The mechanism uses the same motor for both wheeled locomotion and gripping, and no new actuator is needed for transitioning. It is capable of storing small objects, liquid, or soil while still functioning as a wheel. Our analysis showed that those distinctive modes corresponded to the factors of the complex kinematics polynomials of the mechanism. The two modes exist because the polynomials that govern the mechanism's kinematics factor. That is to say, its overall motion is the union of two lower degree irreducible components. A single-leg platform was built to demonstrate its ability to grasp objects and collect water or soil samples, and explore its capability as a contact force sensor through experiments. Such a design could enable wheel-legged robots to perform more diverse loco-manipulation tasks without installing additional limbs.

### [AIKIDO: Combining Inverse Kinematics and Rigid Constrained Dynamics for Online Collision Avoidance]()

Artificial potential fields are used for safety in operational space control by generating repulsive forces near obstacles. They have significant limitations, like causing oscillations near obstacles or at high speeds, affecting dynamics away from unsafe areas, and needing extensive tuning to prevent local minima. Our proposed approach, AIKIDO, aims to maximise motion accuracy and minimise tuning effort, according to the principle that the collision scene geometry, plus the definition of a clearance value, naturally encodes in maximal coordinates safe and unsafe configurations and control inputs. Our key insight is that we can leverage iterative dynamics to test control inputs before applying them to the real system. In our method, the clearance value acts as an exact configurable (even at runtime) safety margin, which defines exactly the minimum allowable distance between collision shapes (e.g., a link and an obstacle). In a receding horizon fashion, we can iteratively predict near-future feasible states adhering closely to control inputs, up to necessary corrections (distance constraints). Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate unmatched motion accuracy in the proximity of obstacles and self-collisions, which enables our method to exhibit superior performance in challenging, general-purpose, arm positioning tasks.

### [HARMONIC: Human-AI Robotic Team Member Operating with Natural Intelligence and Communication]()

This poster introduces HARMONIC, a cognitive-robotic architecture that integrates the LEIA cognitive framework with general-purpose robot control systems applied to human-robot teaming (HRT). We also present a cognitive strategy for robots that incorporates metacognition, natural language communication, and explainability capabilities required for collaborative partnerships in HRT. Through our preliminary simulation experiments involving a joint search task performed by a heterogeneous team of a UGV, a drone, and a human operator, we demonstrate the system's ability to coordinate actions between robots with heterogeneous capabilities, adapt to complex scenarios, and facilitate natural human-robot communication. Evaluation results show that robots using the LEIA architecture within the HARMONIC framework can reason about plans, goals, and team member attitudes while providing clear explanations for their decisions, which are essential prerequisites for realistic human-robot teaming.

### [Enabling Seamless Teleoperation by Means of Shared Autonomy]()

Sharing control with an autonomous controller is a promising approach to reduce the operator's workload and enhance performance in the execution of complex tasks. To assist the operator, the autonomous controller must predict their intention, by monitoring biological signals. In natural manipulation, eye movements play an anticipatory role, making gaze a meaningful signal for decoding human intent. However, the role of gaze in teleoperation remains unclear. We investigated this by analyzing gaze behavior during a teleoperated task, finding that participants directed their gaze toward task-relevant areas, with fixations also on the hand or the moving object. Once the user’s intention is inferred, the robot should assist by autonomously executing actions such as grasping. To this end, we propose a human-inspired reasoning algorithm that reasons about the optimal grasping strategy. The agreement between the decisions of our reasoning algorithm and human behavior in grasping was assessed through a questionnaire in which participants expressed their preferences on how to grasp objects. A significant alignment was observed across most tested conditions. The observed misalignments highlight the importance of balancing the principles that guide human grasping with the needs of robots. In conclusion, by combining the prediction of the human intention with a human-inspired reasoning algorithm for grasp selection, we aim to enhance the collaboration between human operators and robots.

### [Enhancing Sim-To-Real Transfer in High Gear Ratio Quadruped Robot Via Short-Term Temporal Information]()

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based robot control has emerged as a promising approach. However, the transition between simulation and real situations remains a critical challenge, especially for robots equipped with high-speed actuators. To address this issue, we integrate an ideal BLDC motor model into the simulation and introduce Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) that accumulates multiple observations over time. The motor modeling allows us to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, and the TDNN allows the policy to implicitly learn the internal nonlinearities of the actuators. In addition, we introduce an estimator network that simultaneously predicts the robot’s terrain height, foot-ground contact state, and body linear velocity. By combining this estimator with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture and concurrently training it, the trained policy demonstrates that the robot can climb stairs of 17 cm in height and descend stairs of up to 27.5 cm, demonstrating an effective transition from simulation to real situations.

### [Phasing through the Flames: Rapid Motion Planning with the AGHF PDE for Arbitrary Objective Functions and Constraints]()

The generation of optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems under constraints remains computationally challenging due to the need to simultaneously satisfy dynamic feasibility, input limits, and task-specific objectives while searching over high-dimensional spaces. Recent approaches using the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) have demonstrated promising results, generating dynamically feasible trajectories for complex systems like the Digit V3 humanoid within seconds. These methods efficiently solve trajectory optimization problems over a two-dimensional domain by evolving an initial trajectory to minimize control effort. However, these AGHF approaches are limited to a single type of optimal control problem (i.e., minimizing the integral of squared control norms) and typically require initial guesses that satisfy constraints to ensure satisfactory convergence. These limitations restrict the potential utility of the AGHF PDE especially when trying to synthesize trajectories for robotic systems. This paper generalizes the AGHF formulation to accommodate arbitrary cost functions, significantly expanding the classes of trajectories that can be generated. This work also introduces a Phase 1 - Phase 2 Algorithm that enables the use of constraint-violating initial guesses while guaranteeing satisfactory convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comparative evaluations.

### [Heuristic Graphs for Path Planning in Obstacle Fields]()

A kinematic (turn-radius-constrained) vehicle captures the relevant dynamics for global path planning around obstacle fields for many applications. More advanced trajectory optimizers can also use these paths as their initial guess. However, state-of-the-art heuristic graph planners ignore U-turn arcs which may result from the turn radius constraint of the vehicle and sampling-based graphs optimize the path very slowly. These heuristic graphs rapidly find the globally optimal path in cases where the vehicle’s turn radius is large compared to its environment.

### [A Torque-Dense Low-Impedance Powered Knee Exoskeleton with Torque-Sensitive Actuation and Direct Ball-Screw Drive]()

Powered exoskeletons aim to improve human mobility by assisting the user’s biological limbs with robotic actuators. However, conventional robotic actuators with a fixed transmission ratio suffer from an inherent trade-off between motor size, output inertia, and output torque. Therefore, powered exoskeletons utilizing conventional actuators are typically heavy and loud with high joint impedance or lack sufficient torque and power to meaningfully assist the user in challenging activities. These drawbacks significantly diminish the net benefit of wearing powered exoskeletons, limiting their clinical success. In this poster, we present a powered knee exoskeleton that combines a direct-ball screw drive with a variable transmission in a novel torque-sensitive actuator. Benchtop experiments confirm the actuator’s high torque density, low impedance, and quiet operation. Preliminary able-bodied human subject testing verifies the ability of the exoskeleton to provide a significant portion of the user’s biological torque and power in multiple activities. By enabling lightweight, quiet, and powerful exoskeletons, the proposed actuation concept has the potential to improve the clinical benefits of powered knee exoskeletons.

### [Modeling Underactuated Swimmers in Granular Fluid Using Geometric Mechanics]()

Geometric mechanics provides valuable insights into how biological and robotic systems use changes in shape to move by mechanically interacting with their environment. This perspective produced an approach for obtaining simplified data-driven models for locomotion systems directly from motion tracking data. Here we focus on the locomotion of under-actuated robotic systems with passive shape degrees of freedom (DoF), interacting with a granular fluid - a regime we intentionally selected because it is hard to model.	We compared four modeling approaches, predicting body velocity both within gait and across gaits. Switching our model from a phase dependent linear model to a manifold learning approach reduced velocity prediction error by 55% but required 6 times as much data; including the passive DoF in the models reduced prediction errors by 4%. These improvements compound, and yield overall R^2 values above 90%, demonstrating that our data-driven geometric mechanics models for locomotion systems can produce highly predictive models even where no first principles equations of motion are known.

### [Towards an Understanding of Robotic Bin-Picking Throughput]()

NIST leads and supports multiple efforts to develop standards for 3D imaging systems used for industrial automation through ASTM subcommittee E57.23 on Industrial 3D Machine Vision Systems. One of these standards aims to measure the performance of robotic bin-picking systems and NIST has established a testbed with six different bin-picking systems that use a variety of technologies. A working group led by industry experts, is formulating the metrics, artifacts, and test methods to evaluate bin-picking systems. NIST is supporting this effort by performing tests, analyzing data, and developing artifacts. The effort has proposed definitions for terms such as bin-picking vision system, robot cycle time, vision cycle time (VCT), total cycle time (TCT), and bin-picking throughput. NIST conducted tests to understand the effects on a bin-picking system’s throughput of task parameters such as part count, bin depth, part position in bin, part location in FoV, and part geometry/complexity, while keeping vision system parameters constant. Preliminary results based on a representative 3D imaging system show that VCT increases when part number > 10, is not correlated to bin depth or part location, and has slight correlation with robot position and access within a bin. Results also showed that TCT and throughput are strongly correlated with part complexity/symmetry.

### [Design and Implementation of a Low-Profile Hip Exoskeleton for Ergonomics Assistance in Lifting and Ambulation]()

Workplace injuries cost the United States over 160 billion dollars annually. Of these workplace injuries, approximately 29% are musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Previous research has shown that both passive and active exoskeletons can reduce muscle activation for a wide variety of tasks, increase lifting endurance, and decrease the risk of MSDs. Passive exoskeletons tend to be low-profile but have less ability to adapt to multiple movements and use cases, whereas powered exoskeletons can be controlled to benefit multiple movements at the expense of larger size. Here, we propose the design of a low-profile and high torque-density, powered hip and back support exoskeleton to assist with ergonomics in a range of workplace tasks. By assisting the lower back and hips, we aim to reduce muscle effort in lifting tasks, reduce the risk of MSD, and reduce the exertion required for ambulation. According to dynamic simulations, our proposed actuator achieves torques up to 34 Nm of hip torque, representing approximately 35% of the biological torque required for squatting/lifting movement for an average US male. The actuator can also provide up to 31%, 87%, and 35% of the torque required for walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, respectively. The actuator is compatible with exoskeleton interfaces from the on-market IX Back Air (SuitX, USA), which allows for easy donning and doffing. The device adds just 2.8 cm laterally to the body and does not interfere with sitting.

### [A Structurally Decoupled Capacitive Sensing Unit for a Compact Six-Axis FT Sensor]()

A capacitive-type force/torque sensor (FTS) is particularly advantageous for compact and miniature designs. However, miniaturizing the sensor introduces several challenges, such as imbalanced sensitivity that leads to increased coupling errors and a reduced electrode area, which degrades sensing performance and measurement sensitivity. Typically, a six-axis FTS requires at least six electrode components, each dedicated to independently detecting force and torque along normal and shear directions. However, distinguishing and placing electrodes for normal and shear detection becomes spatially inefficient and impractical in miniaturized designs. To address these limitations, we propose a structurally decoupled compliant structure. This structure enables independent measurement along four axes—three for force and one for torque. Furthermore, we present a simplified capacitive sensing approach that does not require the separation of electrodes by direction. Instead, flat electrodes are attached directly to the compliant structure. By isotropically arranging these sensing components, an assembled compact sensing unit capable of six-axis force-torque measurement is realized. This paper presents the proposed capacitive sensing unit's design concept and simulation results.

### [A Lightweight, Fully Integrated Ankle Exoskeleton with High-Torque Density Series-Elastic Actuation]()

Powered ankle exoskeletons have the potential to improve mobility by assisting the ankle joint during ambulation. To achieve this goal, ankle exoskeletons must provide substantial assistive torque in a small and lightweight form. Unfortunately, most exoskeletons are too heavy and bulky for practical application. They often lack protective covers and require wearing a backpack with wires running down the user’s legs, lessening their robustness and utility in the real world. This poster presents a lightweight and compact powered ankle exoskeleton with fully integrated and enclosed actuation, batteries, and electronics. The proposed design features a linear series-elastic actuator (SEA), achieving high torque/power density while enabling high-fidelity closed-loop torque control. The proposed ankle exoskeleton was investigated using a variable stiffness impedance controller with three healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The results of benchtop experiments show a -3 dB bandwidth exceeding 19 Hz. The results of experiments with healthy subjects show a torque density of 37 Nm/kg and a power density of 81.5 W/kg. Experiments with one stroke subject demonstrate that exoskeleton assistance results in more normative ankle and knee kinematics and increases foot clearance. This compact and lightweight ankle exoskeleton design satisfies practical requirements for real-world use while providing sufficient torque density to improve mobility.

### [Data-Driven Contact-Aware Control Method for Real-Time Deformable Tool Manipulation: A Case Study in the Environmental Swabbing]()

Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM) remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the complexities of developing suitable model-based control strategies. Deformable Tool Manipulation (DTM) further complicates this task by introducing additional uncertainties between the robot and its environment. While humans effortlessly manipulate deformable tools using touch and experience, robotic systems struggle to maintain stability and precision. To address these challenges, we present a novel State-Adaptive Koopman LQR (SA-KLQR) control framework for real-time deformable tool manipulation, demonstrated through a case study in environmental swab sampling for food safety. This method leverages Koopman operator-based control to linearize nonlinear dynamics while adapting to state-dependent variations in tool deformation and contact forces. A tactile-based feedback system dynamically estimates and regulates the swab tool’s angle, contact pressure, and surface coverage, ensuring compliance with food safety standards. Additionally, a sensor-embedded contact pad monitors force distribution to mitigate tool pivoting and deformation, improving stability during dynamic interactions. Experimental results validate the SA-KLQR approach, demonstrating accurate contact angle estimation, robust trajectory tracking, and reliable force regulation. The proposed framework bridging the gap between data-driven learning and optimal control in robotic interaction tasks.

### [Variable Size and Variable Stiffness Particles for Reconfigurable Granular Metamaterials]()

Soft robots can achieve exceptional adaptability through tunable morphological and mechanical properties. Incorporating materials with dynamically adjustable characteristics can enhance this versatility further. Granular metamaterials, consisting of discrete particles with individually variable properties, offer a promising approach to bulk property adaptation by adjusting the properties of constituent particles. This work introduces variable size and variable stiffness (VS 2 ) particles, in which both particle size and stiffness are independently modulated through concentric pneumatic chambers. We characterize the achievable workspace, mapping particle responses to independent chamber inflation. To demonstrate their use in a granular assembly, we arrange an array of VS 2 particles in a 2D hexagonal packing and validate that behavior in packed configurations aligns with free-space characterizations. This study establishes a foundation for adaptive granular materials and provides a platform for further computational and experimental exploration of granular metamaterials with tunable properties.

### [LatentBKI: Open-Dictionary Continuous Mapping in Visual-Language Latent Spaces with Quantifiable Uncertainty]()

This paper introduces a novel probabilistic mapping algorithm, LatentBKI, which enables open-vocabulary mapping with quantifiable uncertainty. Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. LatentBKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). LatentBKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular Matterport3D and Semantic KITTI datasets, demonstrating that LatentBKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.

### [Dynamic Parabolic CBF: Collision Avoidance in Multiple Dynamic Obstacle Environments]()

The safe navigation of nonholonomic robots in environments filled with dynamic obstacles requires control strategies that not only guarantee collision-free trajectories but also adapt to real-time changes. In this work, we introduce a novel Control Barrier Function candidate-the Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF)-designed for the kinematic bicycle model. Unlike traditional approaches such as the collision cone-based CBF (C3BF), which relies on a fixed geometric safety boundary and can become overly conservative under high obstacle density, the DPCBF dynamically adjusts the safe set. By redefining safety in a rotated coordinate frame where the x-axis aligns with the relative position vector between the robot and an obstacle, the DPCBF employs a parabolic function whose curvature and translation are tuned according to the current relative distance and velocity. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the DPCBF outperforms the conventional C3BF by maintaining feasibility within the quadratic programming (QP) formulation under scenarios with both static and multiple moving obstacles. The adaptive nature of the parabolic safe set allows the robot to respond effectively to varying collision risks, ensuring fewer QP infeasibilities and more reliable navigation towards the goal.

### [Automatic Cognitive Fatigue Assessment Using Wearable Physiological Sensors During Human-Robot Interaction]()

As assistive robots increasingly support Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), real-time Cognitive Fatigue (CF) assessment is crucial for safety and performance in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Existing approaches often lack multimodal sensing, continuous estimation, or adaptive mechanisms. This study presents a novel framework for automatic CF assessment using data from wearable physiological sensors, such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA), collected from 16 participants while performing collaborative ADL tasks with a mobile manipulator. CF was induced via N-back tasks and validated using the Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F). Machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were applied using the epoch-based pipeline. RFR achieved the highest accuracy in predicting the VAS-F score using only ECG data (R² = 0.89, RMSE = 4.13) and by combining ECG and EDA data (R² = 0.89, RMSE = 4.85). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of continuous CF estimation with wearable sensors. This offline modeling serves as a foundation for integrating real-time adaptation in assistive robotics, enabling personalized and safer HRI.

### [Using VR As an Evaluation Tool for Robot-To-Human Communication in Underwater Tasks]()

Working underwater presents many challenges for human divers; however, the assistance of an underwater robot has the potential to reduce risks by collaborating with a diver and reducing the workload. This work presents a virtual reality (VR) application that simulates a BlueROV2, an underwater robot, to implement and evaluate an underwater robot-to-human interaction scenario, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of communication underwater while collaborating on an inspection and manipulation task. The use of VR allows for more repeatable assessments of robotic performance, with lower risks associated to human users, while providing a level of immersion in the task that compares to humans being underwater wearing goggles. By developing an immersive VR game, combined with Wizard-of-Oz techniques which allow for structured scenarios where the robot can be triggered to interrupt at varying points in the collaboration task, the effects of attention-grabbing strategies and the choices of signal set on human performance can be assessed, as well as the robot’s ability to redirect a human collaborator in underwater tasks.

Addressing key challenges—such as object detection, spatial localization, precision landing, adaptive gripping, and stable airborne transport—the system integrates a rotating camera, servo-driven shovels, and an onboard computer running a deep learning-based detection model. Through synchronized motion and iterative multi-angle analysis, the system accurately identifies, assesses, and retrieves target objects. Experimental validation demonstrates reliable performance in detecting, grasping, weighing, and transporting various items. This work lays the foundation for advanced aerial manipulation, expanding the potential of drones in remote search, recovery, and logistics applications.

### [Quantitative Evaluation Method of the Performance of a Robotic Hand with Reduced Degrees of Freedom]()

Robotic hands inspired by human anatomy are being developed in various forms to perform diverse manipulation tasks. However, faithfully replicating the human hand—comprising complex structures and numerous degrees of freedom (DoFs)—leads to increased manufacturing cost and complexity. In practice, not all DoFs are necessary for every task, and simplified designs often omit or couple certain joints to enhance efficiency. Designing such hands requires a careful balance between task capability and mechanical simplicity, which in turn calls for a quantitative framework to guide DoF configuration based on task requirements. In this study, we propose a method for quantitatively analyzing the task performance of robotic hands with reduced DoFs. By introducing a joint-task matrix that captures the contribution of individual joints to specific tasks, and deriving a joint coupling matrix to reveal dependencies between joints, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate hand configurations. This enables decision-making based on quantitative evaluation when designing simplified robotic hands tailored to specific functional needs.

### [Preliminary Results for the Estimation of Minimum Stride Frequency for Frontal Plane Stability]()

The stability of bipedal system during walking or running depends on both the sagittal and frontal plane dynamics. In the frontal plane, the stability is affected by the hip offset, to the extent that adjusting stride time can lead to stable oscillations without active control, which can reduce the control effort and energy expenditure. However, there is limited understanding of how key parameters—such as mass, stiffness, leg length, and hip width—affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analying how individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the minimum stride frequency required for stable locomotion. Stability is evaluated through eigenvalue analysis of the linearized Poincaré map. We propose a method to predict the minimum stride frequency for various models, and compare predicted stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models, showing a maximum error of approximately 1%.

### [Lazy-DaSH: Lazy Approach for Hypergraph-Based Multi-Robot Task and Motion Planning]()

We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than twice the number of robots and objects while achieving an order of magnitude faster planning when applied to a multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH ensures efficient query performance by utilizing a hierarchical constraint feedback mechanism, effectively conveying motion feasibility to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in two scenarios, demonstrating its scalability with increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback.

### [Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion Via Trajectory Optimization and Symbolic Repair]()

We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.

### [FALA: Formally Augmented Language Agent]()

Recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied task planning has yielded impressive results in unconstrained environments. However, their inherent unreliability—particularly due to hallucinated or inconsistent action predictions—remains a significant challenge. In contrast, formal planning methods offer strong reliability guarantees through explicit logical representations of the environment, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity of open-world tasks. This work explores the complementary strengths of these paradigms. We introduce the Formally Augmented Language Agent (FALA), a hybrid task planning framework that defers to formal methods when possible for robust decision-making, and invokes LLM reasoning only when symbolic representations fall short. This principled integration yields both high reliability and flexibility. We evaluate FALA extensively on the ALFRED benchmark for embodied task planning, achieving a 99% task completion rate using GPT-4o—substantially outperforming prior methods in both accuracy and robustness. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that the addition of FALA's Precondition Verification and Domain Independent Planner to a zero-shot LLM agent significantly improves overall planning performance by an average of ~40% and ~60%, respectively, across 7 different LLM backbones on the ALFRED benchmark. We believe this work represents a major step towards more efficient and reliable LLM planning

### [Solving for Constraint Manifolds Using Neural Networks]()

Constrained motion planning requires robots to satisfy certain conditions, such as keeping a cup upright, while completing a task. Solving for connected regions in the configuration space that satisfy these constraints can be very difficult as the functions used to model these constraints can be highly nonlinear and computationally expensive. Current state-of-the-art methods build piecewise-linear approximations of constraint manifolds to model valid configurations, and additional steps are taken to ensure connectivity between neighboring linear approximations. However, these numerical continuation methods have several drawbacks: they are numerically sensitive, they are incapable of handling inequality constraints, and they have several parameters that are difficult to properly tune. To solve these problems, the proposed method uses a neural network-based approach to learn constraint functions and compute continuous representations of constraint manifolds. The neural network is first decomposed into many different linear output regions. Then, each of these regions is checked to determine whether the constraint function can be satisfied within the given region. The proposed method finally produces a set of polytopes that represent valid configurations for the given constraint.

### [Recent Field Test Results of MoonBots for Moon Base Construction]()

The author’s research group has been conducting an advanced project under Japan's Moonshot R&D Program, aiming to develop a heterogeneous, collaborative multi-robot system for lunar resource exploration and outpost construction. The system features modular robots with reconfigurable mechanical components, enabling adaptive functions and efficient reuse. Plug-and-play AI controllers are being developed to allow each robot to autonomously recognize its configuration and coordinate tasks based on situational context. To validate the concept, field tests using “MoonBots” were conducted at a lunar analog site on JAXA’s Sagamihara campus. Although composed of relatively simple modules—namely “Wheel” and “Arm” units—MoonBots demonstrated diverse capabilities such as self-assembly, rough terrain traversal, material transport, and structural deployment, through modular reconfiguration. Development of the AI system is ongoing, with a focus on achieving real-time coordination, fault tolerance, and dynamic task allocation. Pre-deployment simulations and sim-to-real transfer techniques have accelerated progress and improved reliability. Results confirm the feasibility and scalability of modular, intelligent robot teams for future lunar base construction. The up-to-date results are presented in the late breaking poster session.

### [In-Plane Manipulation of Soft Micro-Fiber with Ultrasonic Transducer Array and Microscope]()

Noncontact manipulation of soft micro-fibers has great potential in advanced manufacturing, materials science, and biomedical engineering. However, current noncontact manipulation techniques primarily focus on objects with regular shapes, e.g., solid particles, cells, or droplets, with fewer solutions available for manipulating flexible and elongated structures. In this paper, an automated ultrasonic manipulation system is introduced for in-plane soft micro-fiber manipulation, which mainly consists of an ultrasonic transducer array and a microscope. A real-time trap generation algorithm is designed to manipulate the micro-fibers by the visual feedback from microscope. An adequate theoretical analysis is also provided for explanation of the deformation behavior of micro-fiber under external forces. The system is capable of precise in-plane positioning and motion trajectory planning to micro-fiber end, and in-plane morphological reshaping to the micro-fiber. Experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed system for the in-plane manipulation of soft micro-fibers. Finally, the system was showcased by the practical application of material property characterization.

### [A Complete and Bounded-Suboptimal Algorithm for a Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem with Obstacles in 3D]()

The moving target traveling salesman problem with obstacles (MT-TSP-O) seeks an obstacle-free trajectory for an agent that intercepts a given set of moving targets, each within a specified time windows, and returns to the agent's starting position. Each target moves with a constant velocity within its time windows, and the agent has a speed limit no smaller than any target's speed. We present FMC*-TSP, the first complete and bounded-suboptimal algorithm for the MT-TSP-O, and results for an agent whose configuration space is in R^3. Our algorithm interleaves a high-level search and a low-level search where the high-level search solves a generalized traveling salesman problem with time windows (GTSP-TW) to find a sequence of targets and corresponding time windows for the agent to visit. Given such a sequence, the low-level search then finds an associated agent trajectory. To solve the low-level planning problem, we develop a new algorithm called FMC*, which finds a shortest path on a graph of convex sets (GCS) via implicit graph search and pruning techniques specialized for problems with moving targets. We test FMC*-TSP on 280 problem instances with up to 40 targets and demonstrate its smaller median runtime than a baseline based on prior work.

### [Physics-Aware Robotic Palletization with Online Masking Inference]()

The efficient planning of stacking boxes, especially in the online setting where the sequence of item arrivals is unpredictable, remains a critical challenge in modern warehouse and logistics management. Existing solutions often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world applications. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by employing action space masking to direct the RL policy towards valid actions. Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for manual heuristic design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our learned task planner in a real-world robotic palletizer, validating its practical applicability in operational settings.

### [Image-Based Compliance Control for Robotic Steering of a Ferromagnetic Guidewire]()

Robotic steering of magnetic guidewires has shown great potential in accelerating endovascular interventions, enhancing the success rate of time-sensitive surgeries such as stroke treatment. Incomplete state feedback of the guidewire from 2D perspective images and unknown interactions with the surrounding vessel wall raise challenges in modeling and steering control. These two factors, however, are commonly overlooked by existing works. In this paper, 2D perspective images of the guidewire, which comply with prevalent medical imaging modalities, are used as the only feedback. A model-based external force observer is proposed that allows the guidewire to perceive the unknown interactions, and a compliance controller is subsequently designed to handle the external force while steering the guidewire. Experiments conducted in a human-sized phantom demonstrate how the compliance controller preserves stability and safety by adapting to the estimated external force.

### [AutoPeel: Adhesion-Aware Safe Peeling Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Wound Care]()

Chronic wounds, including diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and ulcers secondary to venous hypertension, affects more than 6.5 million patients and a yearly cost of more than 25 billion in the United States alone.Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.

The system features a lightweight, actuator-decoupled exoskeleton for shaping motion and providing kinesthetic feedback, along with a vision system and feedback-controlled treadmill for gait analysis. Experiments conducted under anesthesia and in awake conditions demonstrated effective control with minimal interference to natural gait. Dynamic time warping distance and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between joint angles from natural gait and those from rats wearing both passive and active exoskeleton component. The knee joint showed a low DTW distance and high correlation regardless of conditions, while all three joint displayed a greater maximum value from natural gait when the active component was engaged. These results provide valuable insights into the physiological impacts of wearable robotics in animal models, advancing sensorimotor rehabilitation technologies.

### [Stable Tracking of Eye Gaze Direction During Ophthalmic Surgery]()

Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in confined surgical spaces, such as retinal surgery. Despite significant advancements in developing vision- and force-based control methods for these robots, preoperative navigation remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting consistency and increasing uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges such as dependence on additional sensor devices, occlusion issues in surgical environments, and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the need for landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under varying lighting and shadow conditions. The proposed method achieves an average error of 0.58 degrees in estimating eye orientation and an average error of 2.08 degrees in controlling the robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

### [Introspective Loop Closure for SLAM with 4D Imaging Radar]()

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows mobile robots to navigate without external positioning systems or pre-existing maps. Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.

### [Range-Based 6-DoF Monte Carlo SLAM with Gradient-Guided Particle Filter on GPU]()

This paper presents range-based 6-DoF Monte Carlo SLAM with a gradient-guided particle update strategy. While non-parametric state estimation methods, such as particle filters, are robust in situations with high ambiguity, they are known to be unsuitable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a particle update strategy that improves the sampling efficiency by using the gradient information of the likelihood function to guide particles toward its local maxima. Additionally, we introduce a keyframe-based map representation that represents the global map as a set of past frames (i.e., keyframes) to mitigate memory consumption. The keyframe poses for each particle are corrected using a simple loop closure method to maintain trajectory consistency. The combination of gradient information and keyframe-based map representation significantly enhances sampling efficiency and reduces memory usage compared to traditional RBPF approaches. To process a large number of particles (e.g., 100,000 particles) in real-time, the proposed framework is designed to fully exploit GPU parallel processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits extreme robustness to state ambiguity and can even deal with kidnapping situations, such as when the sensor moves to different floors via an elevator, with minimal heuristics.

### [Distributed Certifiably Correct Range-Aided SLAM]()

Reliable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are necessary for safety-critical autonomous navigation. In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.

### [CoVoxSLAM: GPU Accelerated Globally Consistent Dense SLAM]()

A dense SLAM system is essential for mobile robots, as it provides localization and allows navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance, and decision making in unstructured environments. Due to increasing computational demands, the use of GPUs in dense SLAM is expanding. In this work, we present coVoxSLAM, a novel GPU-accelerated volumetric SLAM system that takes full advantage of the parallel processing power of the GPU to build globally consistent maps even in large-scale environments. It was deployed on different platforms (discrete and embedded GPUs) and compared with the state-of-the-art. The results obtained using public datasets show that coVoxSLAM delivers a significant performance improvement considering execution times while maintaining accurate localization. The presented system is available as an open-source system on GitHub: https://github.com/lrse-uba/coVoxSLAM.

### [Radar4VoxMap: Accurate Odometry from Blurred Radar Observations]()

Compared to conventional 3D radar, the 4D imaging radar provides additional height data and finer resolution measurements. Moreover, compared to LiDAR sensors, 4D imaging radar is more cost-effective and offers enhanced durability against challenging weather conditions. Despite these advantages, radar-based localization systems face several challenges, including limited resolution, leading to scattered object recognition and less precise localization. Additionally, existing methods that form submaps from filtered results can accumulate errors, leading to blurred submaps and reducing the accuracy of the SLAM and odometry. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Radar4VoxMap, a novel approach designed to enhance radar-only odometry. The method includes an RCS-weighted voxel distribution map that improves registration accuracy. Furthermore, fixed-lag optimization with the graph is used to optimize both the submap and pose, effectively reducing cumulative errors. The proposed method has shown strong performance on open datasets. The code is available at: url{https://github.com/ailab-hanyang/Radar4VoxMap

### [GenZ-ICP: Generalizable and Degeneracy-Robust LiDAR Odometry Using an Adaptive Weighting]()

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based odometry has been widely utilized for pose estimation due to its use of high-accuracy range measurements and immunity to ambient light conditions. However, the performance of LiDAR odometry varies depending on the environment and deteriorates in degenerative environments such as long corridors. This issue stems from the dependence on a single error metric, which has different strengths and weaknesses depending on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel iterative closest point (ICP) method called GenZ-ICP. We revisited both point-to-plane and point-topoint error metrics and propose a method that leverages their strengths in a complementary manner. Moreover, adaptability to diverse environments was enhanced by utilizing an adaptive weight that is adjusted based on the geometrical characteristics of the surroundings. As demonstrated in our experimental evaluation, the proposed GenZ-ICP exhibits high adaptability to various environments and resilience to optimization degradation in corridor-like degenerative scenarios by preventing ill-posed problems during the optimization process. Our code is available at https://github.com/cocel-postech/genz-icp.

### [Free-Init: Scan-Free, Motion-Free, and Correspondence-Free Initialization for Doppler LiDAR-Inertial Systems]()

Robust initialization is crucial for online systems. In the letter, a high-frequency and resilient initialization framework is designed for LiDAR-inertial systems, leveraging both inertial sensors and Doppler LiDAR. The innovative FMCW Doppler LiDAR opens up a novel avenue for robotic sensing by capturing not only point range but also Doppler velocity via the intrinsic Doppler effect. By fusing point-wise Doppler velocity with inertial measurements under non-inertial kinematics, the proposed framework, Free-Init, eliminates reliance on motion undistortion of LiDAR scans, excitation motions, and map correspondences during the initialization phase. Free-Init is also plug-and-play compatible with typical LiDAR-inertial systems and is versatile to handle a wide range of initial motions when the system starts, including stationary, dynamic, and even violent motions. The embedded Doppler-inertial velocimeter ensures fast convergence and high-frequency performance, delivering outputs exceeding 10 kHz. Comprehensive experiments on diverse platforms and across myriad motion scenes validate the framework's effectiveness. The results demonstrate the superior performance of Free-Init, highlighting the necessity of fast, resilient, and dynamic initialization for online systems.

### [Development of a 2-DOF Singularity-Free Spherical Parallel Remote Center of Motion Mechanism with Extensive Range of Motion]()

In this paper, we report the development of an innovative two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) spherical parallel remote center of motion mechanism (SPRCMM), which can offer a wide range of movement in both DOFs without encountering singularities. To facilitate the design process, the paper briefly reviews the existing spherical joints, including serial and parallel structures with and without the remote center of motion (RCM). Aiming at combining the advantages of these existing spherical joints, this paper proposes a novel design that utilizes the parallelogram mechanism to form a parallel RCM mechanism without using universal or spherical joints. Forward and inverse kinematics were constructed using the product of the exponentials. Moreover, space and closed Jacobians were derived, accompanied by manipulability in the available workspace for the mechanism. The prototype of the 2-DOF SPRCMM was built and experimentally evaluated. The experimental results confirm that the singularity-free motion of the two DOFs of the mechanism in a wide range is feasible, and the root mean squared errors in the trajectory tracking of the mechanism in most states were less than 10% of the motion range.

### [Highly Dynamic Physical Interaction for Robotics: Design and Control of an Active Remote Center of Compliance]()

Robot interaction control is often limited to low dynamics or low flexibility, depending on whether an active or passive approach is chosen. In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times. We introduce further our control approach as well as the integration in the robot controller. Finally, we analyze ARCC on different industrial benchmarks like peg-in-hole, top-hat rail assembly and contour following problems and compare it against the state of the art, to highlight the dynamic and flexibility. The proposed system is especially suited if the application requires a low cycle time combined with a sensitive manipulation.

### [Pinto: A Latched Spring Actuated Robot for Jumping and Perching]()

Arboreal environments challenge current robots but are deftly traversed by many familiar animals such as squirrels. We present a small, 450 g robot "Pinto" developed for tree-jumping, a behavior seen in squirrels but rarely in legged robots: jumping from the ground onto a vertical tree trunk. We develop a powerful and lightweight latched series-elastic actuator using a twisted string and carbon fiber springs. We consider the effects of scaling down conventional quadrupeds and experimentally show how storing energy in a parallel-elastic fashion using a latch increases jump energy compared to series-elastic or springless strategies. By switching between series and parallel-elastic modes with our latched 5-bar leg mechanism, Pinto executes energetic jumps as well as maintains continuous control during shorter bounding motions. We also develop sprung 2-DoF arms equipped with spined grippers to grasp tree bark for high-speed perching following a jump.

### [D3-ARM: High-Dynamic, Dexterous and Fully Decoupled Cable-Driven Robotic Arm]()

Cable transmission enables motors of robotic arm to operate lightweight and low-inertia joints remotely in various environments, but it also creates issues with motion coupling and cable routing that can reduce arm's control precision and performance. In this paper, we present a novel motion decoupling mechanism with low-friction to align the cables and efficiently transmit the motor's power. By arranging these mechanisms at the joints, we fabricate a fully decoupled and lightweight cable-driven robotic arm called D3-Arm with all the electrical components be placed at the base. Its 776 mm length moving part boasts six degrees of freedom (DOF) and only 1.6 kg weights. To address the issue of cable slack, a cable-pretension mechanism is integrated to enhance the stability of long-distance cable transmission. Through a series of comprehensive tests, D3-Arm demonstrated 1.29 mm average positioning error and 2 kg payload capacity, proving the practicality of the proposed decoupling mechanisms in cable-driven robotic arm.

### [Design of an Articulated Modular Caterpillar Using Spherical Linkages]()

Articulation between body segments of small insects and animals is a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion. Implementing this kind of motion in a compact robot is usually not tractable due to limitations in small actuator technologies. In this work, we concede full 3-DOF control and instead select a one degree-of-freedom curve in SO(3) to articulate segments of a caterpillar robot. The curve is approximated with a spherical four-bar, which is synthesized through optimal rigid body guidance. We specify the desired SO(3) motion using discrete task positions, then solve for candidate mechanisms by computing all roots of the stationary conditions using numerical homotopy continuation. A caterpillar robot prototype demonstrates the utility of this approach. This synthesis procedure is also used to design prolegs for the caterpillar robot. Each segment contains two DC motors and a shape memory alloy, which is used for latching and unlatching between segments. The caterpillar robot is capable of walking, steering, object manipulation, body articulation, and climbing.

### [Generative-AI-Driven Jumping Robot Design Using Diffusion Models]()

Recent advances in foundation models are significantly expanding the capabilities of AI models. As part of this progress, this paper introduces a robot design framework that uses a diffusion model approach for generating 3D mesh structures. Specifically, we focus on generating directly fabricable robot structures that require no post-processing guided by human-imposed design constraints. Our approach can find the optimal design of the robot by optimizing or composing embedding vectors of the model. The efficacy of the framework is validated through an application to design, fabricate, and evaluate a jumping robot. Our solution is an optimized jumping robot with a 41% increase in jump height compared to the state-of-the-art design. Additionally, when the robot is augmented with an optimized foot, it can land reliably with a success ratio of 88% in contrast to the 4% success ratio of the base robot.

### [A Hessian for Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods in Nonlinear Least Squares]()

This paper proposes a novel Hessian approximation for Maximum a Posteriori estimation problems in robotics involving Gaussian mixture likelihoods. Previous approaches manipulate the Gaussian mixture likelihood into a form that allows the problem to be represented as a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. The resulting Hessian approximation used within NLS solvers from these approaches neglects certain nonlinearities. The proposed Hessian approximation is derived by setting the Hessians of the Gaussian mixture component errors to zero, which is the same starting point as for the Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation for NLS, and using the chain rule to account for additional nonlinearities. The proposed Hessian approximation results in improved convergence speed and uncertainty characterization for simulated experiments, and similar performance to the state of the art on real-world experiments. A method to maintain compatibility with existing solvers, such as ceres, is also presented. Accompanying software and supplementary material can be found at https://github.com/decargroup/hessian_sum_mixtures.

### [Unveiling the Depths: A Multi-Modal Fusion Framework for Challenging Scenarios]()

Monocular depth estimation from RGB images plays a pivotal role in 3D vision. However, its accuracy can deteriorate in challenging environments such as nighttime or adverse weather conditions. While long-wave infrared cameras offer stable imaging in such challenging conditions, they are inherently low-resolution, lacking rich texture and semantics as delivered by the RGB image. Current methods focus solely on a single modality due to the difficulties to identify and integrate faithful depth cues from both sources. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that identifies and integrates dominant cross-modality depth features with a learning-based framework. Concretely, we independently compute the coarse depth maps with separate networks by fully utilizing the individual depth cues from each modality. As the advantageous depth spreads across both modalities, we propose a novel confidence loss steering a confidence predictor network to yield a confidence map specifying latent potential depth areas. With the resulting confidence map, we propose a multi-modal fusion network that fuses the final depth in an end-to-end manner. Harnessing the proposed pipeline, our method demonstrates the ability of robust depth estimation in a variety of difficult scenarios. Experimental results on the challenging MS^2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

### [Explore the LiDAR-Camera Dynamic Adjustment Fusion for 3D Object Detection]()

Camera and LiDAR serve as informative sensors for accurate and robust autonomous driving systems. However, these sensors often exhibit heterogeneous natures, resulting in distributional modality gaps that present significant challenges for fusion. To address this, a robust fusion technique is crucial, particularly for enhancing 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic adjustment technology aimed at aligning modal distributions and learning effective modality representations to enhance the fusion process. Specifically, we propose a triphase domain aligning module. This module adjusts the feature distributions from both the camera and LiDAR, bringing them closer to the ground truth domain and minimizing differences. Additionally, we explore improved representation acquisition methods for dynamic fusion, which includes modal interaction and specialty enhancement. Finally, an adaptive learning technique that merges the semantics and geometry information for dynamical instance optimization. Extensive experiments in the nuScenes dataset present competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be released in the future.

### [Bridging Spectral-Wise and Multi-Spectral Depth Estimation Via Geometry-Guided Contrastive Learning]()

Deploying depth estimation networks in the real world requires high-level robustness against various adverse conditions to ensure safe and reliable autonomy. For this purpose, many autonomous vehicles employ multi-modal sensor systems, including an RGB camera, NIR camera, thermal camera, LiDAR, or Radar. They mainly adopt two strategies to use multiple sensors: modality-wise and multi-modal fused inference. The former method is flexible but memory-inefficient, unreliable, and vulnerable. Multi-modal fusion can provide high-level reliability, yet it needs a specialized architecture. In this paper, we propose an effective solution, named align-and-fuse strategy, for the depth estimation from multi-spectral images. In the align stage, we align embedding spaces between multiple spectrum bands to learn shareable representation across multi-spectral images by minimizing contrastive loss of global and spatially aligned local features with geometry cues. After that, in the fuse stage, we train an attachable feature fusion module that can selectively aggregate the multi-spectral features for reliable and robust prediction results. Based on the proposed method, a single-depth network can achieve both spectral-invariant and multi-spectral fused depth estimation while preserving reliability, memory efficiency, and flexibility.

### [VAIR: Visuo-Acoustic Implicit Representations for Low-Cost, Multi-Modal Transparent Surface Reconstruction in Indoor Scenes]()

Mobile robots operating indoors must be prepared to navigate challenging scenes that contain transparent surfaces. This paper proposes a novel method for the fusion of acoustic and visual sensing modalities through implicit neural represen- tations to enable dense reconstruction of transparent surfaces in indoor scenes. We propose a novel model that leverages generative latent optimization to learn an implicit representation of indoor scenes consisting of transparent surfaces. We demonstrate that we can query the implicit representation to enable volumetric rendering in image space or 3D geometry reconstruction (point clouds or mesh) with transparent surface prediction. We evaluate our method’s effectiveness qualitatively and quantitatively on a new dataset collected using a custom, low-cost sensing platform featuring RGB-D cameras and ultrasonic sensors. Our method exhibits significant improvement over state-of-the-art for transparent surface reconstruction.

### [CDMFusion: RGB-T Image Fusion Based on Conditional Diffusion Models Via Few Denoising Steps in Open Environments]()

Multi-modal fusion can improve perceptual robustness and accuracy by fully utilizing multi-source sensor data. Current RGB-T fusion methods still falter with adverse illumination and weather. Recent advances in generative methods have shown the ability to enhance and restore visible images in adverse conditions. However, the fusion of RGB-T based on generative methods has not been studied in depth, due to limited attention given to the degradation of multi-modal features under challenging circumstances. Motivated by this observation, we propose CDMFusion, a three-branch conditional diffusion model that achieves fusion with dynamically enhancing multi-modal features and suppressing high-frequency interference. Specifically, we achieve feature-preserving fusion through three branches and establish a dynamic gating prediction module to adjust the enhancement of multi-modal features adaptively. In addition, considering the high time cost of existing diffusion models for generating fused images, we propose a skip patrol mechanism to achieve accelerated high-quality generation with no need for additional training. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves excellent performance in multiple datasets. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/yangluojie/CDMFusion.

### [UniBEVFusion: Unified Radar-Vision BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection]()

4D millimeter-wave (MMW) radar, which provides both height information and dense point cloud data over 3D MMW radar, has become increasingly popular in 3D object detection. In recent years, radar-vision fusion models have demonstrated performance close to that of LiDAR-based models, offering advantages in terms of lower hardware costs and better resilience in extreme conditions. However, many radar-vision fusion models treat radar as a sparse LiDAR, underutilizing radar-specific information. Additionally, these multi-modal networks are often sensitive to the failure of a single modality, particularly vision. To address these challenges, we propose the Radar Depth Lift-Splat-Shoot (RDL) module, which integrates radar-specific data into the depth prediction process, enhancing the quality of visual Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) features. We further introduce a Unified Feature Fusion (UFF) approach that extracts BEV features across different modalities using shared module. To assess the robustness of multi-modal models, we develop a novel Failure Test (FT) ablation experiment, which simulates vision modality failure by injecting Gaussian noise. We conduct extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4D datasets. The results demonstrated that our proposed Unified BEVFusion (UniBEVFusion) network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TJ4D dataset, with improvements of 3.96% in 3D and 4.17% in BEV object detection accuracy.

### [A Generalized Thrust Estimation and Control Approach for Multirotors Micro Aerial Vehicles]()

This paper addresses the problem of thrust estimation and control for the rotors of small-sized multirotors Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Accurate control of the thrust generated by each rotor during flight is one of the main challenges for robust control of quadrotors. The most common approach is to approximate the mapping of rotor speed to thrust with a simple quadratic model. This model is known to fail under non-hovering flight conditions, introducing errors into the control pipeline. One of the approaches to modeling the aerodynamics around the propellers is the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT). Here, we propose a novel BEMT-based closed-loop thrust estimator and control to eliminate the laborious calibration step of finding several aerodynamic coefficients. We aim to reuse known values as a baseline and fit the thrust estimate to values closest to the real ones with a simple test bench experiment, resulting in a single scaling value. A feedforward PID thrust control was implemented for each rotor, and the methods were validated by outdoor experiments with two multirotor UAV platforms: 250mm and 500mm. A statistical analysis of the results showed that the thrust estimation and control provided better robustness under aerodynamically varying flight conditions compared to the quadratic model.

### [Trajectory Planning and Control for Differentially Flat Fixed-Wing Aerial Systems]()

Efficient real-time trajectory planning and control for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles is challenging due to their non-holonomic nature, complex dynamics, and the additional uncertainties introduced by unknown aerodynamic effects. In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in generating trajectories across various flight conditions, including wind disturbances.

### [Safe Quadrotor Navigation Using Composite Control Barrier Functions]()

This paper introduces a safety filter to ensure collision avoidance for multirotor aerial robots. The proposed formalism leverages a single Composite Control Barrier Function from all position constraints acting on a third-order nonlinear representation of the robot's dynamics. We analyze the recursive feasibility of the safety filter under the composite constraint and demonstrate that the infeasible set is negligible. The proposed method allows computational scalability against thousands of constraints and, thus, complex scenes with numerous obstacles. We experimentally demonstrate its ability to guarantee the safety of a quadrotor with an onboard LiDAR, operating in both indoor and outdoor cluttered environments against both naive and adversarial nominal policies.

### [The Spinning Blimp: Design and Control of a Novel Minimalist Aerial Vehicle Leveraging Rotational Dynamics and Locomotion]()

This paper presents the Spinning Blimp, a novel lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial vehicle designed for low-energy stable flight. Using an oblate spheroid helium balloon for buoyancy, the vehicle achieves minimal energy consumption while maintaining prolonged airborne states. The unique and low-cost design employs a passively arranged wing coupled with a propeller to induce a spinning behavior, providing inherent pendulum-like stabilization. We propose a control strategy that takes advantage of the continuous revolving nature of the spinning blimp to control translational motion. The cost-effectiveness of the vehicle makes it highly suitable for a variety of applications, such as patrolling, localization, air and turbulence monitoring, and domestic surveillance. Experimental evaluations affirm the design's efficacy and underscore its potential as a versatile and economically viable solution for aerial applications.

### [One Net to Rule Them All: Domain Randomization in Quadcopter Racing across Different Platforms]()

In high-speed quadcopter racing, finding a single controller that works well across different platforms remains challenging. This work presents the first neural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain randomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The effectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across different platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real transfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed. Despite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain randomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI controllers that can adapt to any platform.

### [Modeling and Control of Aerial Robot SERPENT: A Soft Structure Incorporated Multirotor Aerial Robot Capable of In-Flight Flexible Deformation]()

This paper introduces a novel method for controlling multirotor aerial robots connected by passive flexible elements. Despite the growing popularity of multirotor aerial robots, their real-world applications remain limited due to difficulties adapting to complex environments. Soft robotics, due to their inherent flexibility, offer a potential solution, though research on integrating flexible elements into aerial robots is still in the early stages. In this study, we propose control methods for a system where multiple aerial robots are interconnected with passive flexible elements. These robotic systems enhance adaptability, enabling tasks like object manipulation. We model the flexible parts using the piecewise constant strain (PCS) model, which allows for model-based closed-loop control and stabilizes various configurations of the system. Through simulations and experiments, we validated that the proposed method achieves both stable flight and flexible deformation. Notably, we succeeded in maintaining stable flight, which was not possible with traditional methods, and demonstrated both positional controllability and the ability of the flexible parts to bend dynamically during flight.

### [Embodying Compliant Touch on Drones for Aerial Tactile Navigation]()

Aerial robots are a well-established solution for environmental surveying, exploration, and inspection, thanks to their superior maneuverability and agility. Nowadays, the algorithms that provide these capabilities rely on GNSS and Vision, which are obstructed in some environments of interest, e.g., indoors and underground or in smoke and dust. In similar conditions, animals rely on the sense of touch and compliant responses to interactions embodied in the body morphology. This way, they can navigate safely using tactile cues by feeling the environment surrounding them. In this work, we take inspiration from the natural example and propose an approach that allows a quadrotor to navigate using tactile information from the environment. We propose to endow a conventional quadrotor with a novel robotic finger that embodies compliance and sensing capabilities. We complete this design with a navigation approach that generates new waypoints based on the robotic finger's contact information to follow the unknown environment. The overall system's evaluation shows successful, repeatable results in 36 flight experiments with various relative angles between the drone and a planar surface.

### [Adaptive Learning for Hybrid Visual Odometry]()

Hybrid visual odometry methods achieve state-of-the-art performance by fusing both data-based deep learning networks and rule-based localization approaches. However, these methods also suffer from deep learning domain gap problems, which leads to an accuracy drop of the hybrid visual odometry approach when new type of data is considered. This paper is the first to explore a practical solution to this problem. Indeed, the deep learning network in the hybrid visual odometry predicts the stereo disparity with fixed searching space. However, the disparity distribution is unbalanced in stereo images acquired in different environments. We propose an adaptive network structure to overcome this problem. Secondly, the rule-based localization module has a robust performance by online optimizing the camera pose in test data, which motivates us to introduce test-time training machine learning method for improving the data-based part of the hybrid visual odometry.

### [SOLVR: Submap Oriented LiDAR-Visual Re-Localisation]()

This paper proposes SOLVR, a unified pipeline for learning based LiDAR-Visual re-localisation which performs place recognition and 6-DoF registration across sensor modalities. We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place.

### [SSF: Sparse Long-Range Scene Flow for Autonomous Driving]()

Scene flow enables an understanding of the motion characteristics of the environment in the 3D world. It gains particular significance in the long-range, where object-based perception methods might fail due to sparse observations far away. Although significant advancements have been made in scene flow pipelines to handle large-scale point clouds, a gap remains in scalability with respect to long-range. We attribute this limitation to the common design choice of using dense feature grids, which scale quadratically with range. In this paper, we propose Sparse Scene Flow (SSF), a general pipeline for long-range scene flow, adopting a sparse convolution based backbone for feature extraction. This approach introduces a new challenge: a mismatch in size and ordering of sparse feature maps between time-sequential point scans. To address this, we propose a sparse feature fusion scheme, that augments the feature maps with virtual voxels at missing locations. Additionally, we propose a range-wise metric that implicitly gives greater importance to faraway points. Our method, SSF, achieves state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse2 dataset, demonstrating strong performance in long-range scene flow estimation. Our source code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/SSF.

### [BoxMap: Efficient Structural Mapping and Navigation]()

While humans can successfully navigate using abstractions, ignoring details that are irrelevant to the task at hand, most of the existing approaches in robotics require detailed environment representations which consume a significant amount of sensing, computing, and storage; these issues become particularly important in resource-constrained settings with limited power budgets. Deep learning methods can learn from prior experience to abstract knowledge from novel environments, and use it to more efficiently execute tasks such as frontier exploration, object search, or scene understanding. We propose BoxMap, a Detection-Transformer-based architecture that takes advantage of the structure of the sensed partial environment to update a topological graph of the environment as a set of semantic entities (rooms and doors) and their relations (connectivity). The predictions from low-level measurements can be leveraged to achieve high-level goals with lower computational costs than methods based on detailed representations. As an example application, we consider a robot equipped with a 2-D laser scanner tasked with exploring a residential building. Our BoxMap representation scales quadratically with the number of rooms (with a small constant), resulting in significant savings over a full geometric map. Moreover, our high-level topological representation results in 30.9% shorter trajectories in the exploration task with respect to a standard method. Code is available at: bit.ly/3F6w2Yl.

### [UncAD: Towards Safe End-To-End Autonomous Driving Via Online Map Uncertainty]()

End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction, and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a 1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%. Codes, pre-trained models, and demo videos can be accessed at https://github.com/pengxuanyang/UncAD.

### [Multi-Floor Zero-Shot Object Navigation Policy]()

Object navigation in multi-floor environments presents a formidable challenge in robotics, requiring sophisticated spatial reasoning and adaptive exploration strategies. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on single-floor scenarios, overlooking the complexities introduced by multi-floor structures. To address these challenges, we first propose a Multi-floor Navigation Policy (MFNP) and implement it in Zero-Shot object navigation tasks. Our framework comprises three key components: (i) Multi-floor Navigation Policy, which enables an agent to explore across multiple floors; (ii) Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning in the navigation process; and (iii) Inter-Floor Navigation, ensuring efficient floor transitions. We evaluate MFNP on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Matterport 3D (MP3D) datasets, both include multi-floor scenes. Our experiment results demonstrate that MFNP significantly outperforms all the existing methods in Zero-Shot object navigation, achieving higher success rates and improved exploration efficiency. Ablation studies further highlight the effectiveness of each component in addressing the unique challenges of multi-floor navigation. Meanwhile, we conducted real-world experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our policy. Upon deployment of MFNP, the Unitree quadruped robot demonstrated successful multi-floor navigation and found the target object in a completely unseen environment. By introducing MFNP, we offer a new paradigm for tackling complex, multi-floor environments in object navigation tasks, opening avenues for future research in visual-based navigation in realistic, multi-floor settings.

### [Fed-EC: Bandwidth-Efficient Clustering-Based Federated Learning for Autonomous Visual Robot Navigation]()

Centralized learning requires data to be aggregated at a central server, which poses significant challenges in terms of data privacy and bandwidth consumption. Federated learning presents a compelling alternative, however, vanilla Federated Learning methods deployed in robotics aim to learn a single global model across robots that works ideally for all. But in practice one model may not be well suited for robots deployed in various environments. This paper proposes Federated-EmbedCluster (Fed-EC), a clustering-based federated learning framework that is deployed with vision based autonomous robot navigation in diverse outdoor environments. The framework addresses the key federated learning challenge of deteriorating model performance of a single global model due to the presence of non-IID data across real-world robots. Extensive real-world experiments validate that Fed-EC reduces the communication size by 23x for each robot while matching the performance of centralized learning for goal-oriented navigation and outperforms local learning. Fed-EC can transfer previously learnt models to new robots that join the cluster.

### [Using a Distance Sensor to Detect Deviations in a Planar Surface]()

We investigate methods for determining if a planar surface contains geometric deviations (e.g. protrusions, objects, divots, or cliffs) using only an instantaneous measurement from a miniature optical time-of-flight sensor. The key to our method is to utilize the entirety of information encoded in raw time-of-flight data captured by off-the-shelf distance sensors. We provide an analysis of the problem in which we identify the key ambiguity between geometry and surface photometrics. To overcome this challenging ambiguity, we fit a Gaussian mixture model to a small dataset of planar surface measurements. This model implicitly captures the expected geometry and distribution of photometrics of the planar surface and is used to identify measurements that are likely to contain deviations. We characterize our method on a variety of surfaces and planar deviations across a range of scenarios. We find that our method utilizing raw time-of-flight data outperforms baselines which use only derived distance estimates. We build an example application in which our method enables mobile robot obstacle and cliff avoidance over a wide field-of-view.

### [Narrowing Your FOV with SOLiD: Spatially Organized and Lightweight Global Descriptor for FOV-Constrained LiDAR Place Recognition]()

We often encounter limited FOV situations due to various factors such as sensor fusion or sensor mount in real-world robot navigation. However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released. Also, the supplementary materials of our descriptor are available at https://sites.google.com/view/lidar-solid.

### [Spatially Constrained and Deeply Learned Bilateral Structural Intensity-Depth Registration Autonomously Navigates a Flexible Endoscope]()

Endoscope tracking is commonly utilized to provide surgeons with in-body camera poses and visual fields during invasive procedures. The fundamental aspect of endoscopic navigation lies in precisely and continuously tracing the position and orientation of the endoscope within monocular endoscopic video sequences in a preoperative data space. This work proposes a new spatially constrained and deeply learned bilateral structural intensity-depth 2D-3D registration framework for autonomously navigating a flexible endoscope. Concretely, a novel bilateral structural intensity-depth similarity function is defined to tackle the deficiency of using image intensity, while a cross-domain monocular depth estimation model trained on virtual image data is used to accurately predict real image dense depth. Additionally, a spatial constraint is introduced to precisely reinitialize an optimizer to reduce accumulative tracking errors. We validate our method on clinical data, with the experimental results showing that our method significantly outperforms current vision-based navigation methods. Particularly, the average of position and orientation errors were reduced from (4.59mm, 9.22degree) to (1.65mm, 4.67degree).

### [E2B: A Single Modality Point-Based Tracker with Event Cameras]()

High-speed object tracking holds significant relevance across robotic domains, such as drones and autonomous driving. Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras are equipped with the ability to capture object motion information at exceptionally high temporal resolution with relatively low power consumption and remain immune from motion-blurring effects. Regrettably, many existing methods adopt a frame-based approach by stacking events into Event Frame, which overlooks the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events. This approach is reliant on the pre-training backbone and reaches a performance plateau but demands unrealistically large networks and high power consumption, rendering it impractical for real-time applications in battery-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective single-modality tracker using Point Cloud representation named E2B (Event to Box). By directly handling the raw output of event cameras without dataformat transformation, E2B leverages events' coordinate guidance to accurately map Event Cloud features to 2D bounding boxes. Moreover, E2B incorporates the pyramid structure into the multi-stage feature extraction architecture to effectively track objects across diverse scales. In the experiments, E2B performs outstandingly on two large-scale and one synthetic event-based tracking datasets, covering both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as rigid and non-rigid objects.

### [F²R²: Frequency Filtering-Based Rectification Robustness Method for Stereo Matching]()

Most stereo matching networks assume that the stereo images are perfectly rectified, ignoring the perturbation of extrinsic parameters due to collisions, mechanical vibrations, and thermal expansion. This leads to poor rectification robustness in real-world stereo systems. That is, even minor rectification errors can lead to failure, making stereo systems unreliable for long-term autonomous operation in complex environments. In this paper, we are the first to propose a frequency filtering-based rectification robustness (F²R²) method for stereo matching, which aims to enhance the robustness of existing stereo networks to rectification errors. Specifically, we propose a sensitive frequency filter (SFF) to remove components susceptible to rectification errors within the frequency domain. SFF achieves the filtering through the learning-based adaptive filtering mask (AFM) guided by the spatial-frequency mapping modulation mask (SFM). Moreover, we build the matching feature reconstruction module (MFRM) to recover the features lost during filtering to benefit cost aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on simulated datasets and self-collected data validate that our method can significantly enhance the rectification robustness of stereo matching networks.

### [VisTune: Auto-Tuner for UAVs Using Vision-Based Localization]()

This paper presents VisTune, a method for automatic controller tuning, specifically designed for UAVs using vision-based localization for position control. In contrast to existing methods that involve flying the UAV manually to collect the data for system identification and tuning, our approach leverages relay-based system identification and tuning that autonomously generates stable oscillations, without the need for stabilizing controller. The whole process concludes within few seconds. Prior work in vision-based position control of the UAVs often ignores the delay from the perception pipeline, which is quite significant and results in suboptimal tuning and poor control performance. Our approach accounts for perception delay and addresses practical issues, such as varying delays due to varying computation requirements and inevitable estimation errors, which pose challenges in applying relay-based identification and tuning. Typically, VBL system introduces over 100 ms delay, compared to less than 20 ms delay when motion capture system is used. Moreover, we show that the perception delay identified by VisTune can be effectively used to temporally advance the feedforward acceleration signal to achieve better tracking performance. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the tuned controllers on a trajectory tracking task, reaching speed up to 2.1 m/s with RMS control error of only 0.054 m while under wind disturbance of 5 m/s we report RMSE of 0.116 m. A video of experiments is available at https://youtu.be/hJoT8bn0K0o

### [GeMuCo: Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model for Body Schema Learning]()

Humans can autonomously learn the relationship between sensation and motion in their own bodies, estimate and control their own body states, and move while continuously adapting to the current environment. On the other hand, current robots control their bodies by learning the network structure described by humans from their experiences, making certain assumptions on the relationship between sensors and actuators. In addition, the network model does not adapt to changes in the robot's body, the tools that are grasped, or the environment, and there is no unified theory, not only for control but also for state estimation, anomaly detection, simulation, and so on. In this study, we propose a Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model (GeMuCo), in which the robot itself acquires a body schema describing the correlation between sensors and actuators from its own experience, including model structures such as network input/output. The robot adapts to the current environment by updating this body schema model online, estimates and controls its body state, and even performs anomaly detection and simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to tool-use co

### [SplatSim: Zero-Shot Sim2Real Transfer of RGB Manipulation Policies Using Gaussian Splatting]()

Sim2Real transfer, particularly for manipulation policies relying on RGB images, remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the significant domain shift between synthetic and real-world visual data. In this paper, we propose SplatSim, a novel framework that leverages Gaussian Splatting as the primary rendering primitive to reduce the Sim2Real gap for RGB-based manipulation policies. By replacing traditional mesh representations with Gaussian Splats in simulators, SplatSim produces highly photorealistic synthetic data while maintaining the scalability and cost-efficiency of simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by training manipulation policies within SplatSim and deploying them in the real world in a zero-shot manner, achieving an average success rate of 86.25%, compared to 97.5% for policies trained on real-world data.

### [SR-AIF: Solving Sparse-Reward Robotic Tasks from Pixels with Active Inference and World Models]()

Although research has produced promising results demonstrating the utility of active inference (AIF) in Markov decision processes (MDPs), there is relatively less work that builds AIF models in the context of environments and problems that take the form of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In POMDP scenarios, the agent must infer the unobserved environmental state from raw sensory observations, e.g., pixels in an image. Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate.

### [Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning]()

Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.

### [Chain-Of-Modality: Learning Manipulation Programs from Multimodal Human Videos with Vision-Language-Models]()

Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data --- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

### [VertiCoder: Self-Supervised Kinodynamic Representation Learning on Vertically Challenging Terrain]()

We present VertiCoder, a self-supervised representation learning approach for robot mobility on vertically challenging terrain. Using the same pre-training process, VertiCoder can handle four different downstream tasks, including forward kinodynamics learning, inverse kinodynamics learning, behavior cloning, and patch reconstruction with a single representation. VertiCoder uses a TransformerEncoder to learn the local context of its surroundings by random masking and next patch reconstruction. We show that VertiCoder achieves better performance across all four different tasks compared to specialized End-to-End models with 77% fewer parameters. We also show VertiCoder's comparable performance against state-of-the-art kinodynamic modeling and planning approaches in real-world robot deployment. These results underscore the efficacy of VertiCoder in mitigating overfitting and fostering more robust generalization across diverse environmental contexts and downstream vehicle kinodynamic tasks.

### [Correspondence Learning between Morphologically Different Robots Via Task Demonstrations]()

We observe a large variety of robots in terms of their bodies, sensors, and actuators. Given the commonalities in the skill sets, teaching each skill to each different robot independently is inefficient and not scalable when the large variety in the robotic landscape is considered. If we can learn the correspondences between the sensorimotor spaces of different robots, we can expect a skill that is learned in one robot can be more directly and easily transferred to other robots. In this paper, we propose a method to learn correspondences hakan{among two or more robots that may have different morphologies. To be specific, besides robots with similar morphologies with different degrees of freedom, we show that a fixed-based manipulator robot with joint control and a differential drive mobile robot can be addressed within the proposed framework. To set up the correspondence among the robots considered, an initial base task is demonstrated to the robots to achieve the same goal. Then, a common latent representation is learned along with the individual robot policies for achieving the goal.} After the initial learning stage, the observation of a new task execution by one robot becomes sufficient to generate a latent space representation pertaining to the other robots to achieve the same task. We verified our system in a set of experiments where the correspondence between robots is learned (1) when the robots need to follow the same paths to achieve the same task, (2) when the robots need to follow different trajectories to achieve the same task, and (3) when complexities of the required sensorimotor trajectories are different for the robots. We also provide a proof-of-the-concept realization of correspondence learning between a real manipulator robot and a simulated mobile robot.

### [Planning-Oriented Cooperative Perception among Heterogeneous Vehicles]()

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) based cooperative perception enhances autonomous driving by overcoming single-agent perception limitations such as occlusions, without relying on extensive infrastructure. However, most existing methods have two key limitations. They treat cooperative perception in isolation, with little consideration for downstream tasks such as planning, leading to poor coordination and inefficient planning decisions. They also assume perception model homogeneity across all vehicles, which can be impractical among vehicles from different manufacturers. To bridge such gaps, we propose Scout, an early-fusion framework for planning-oriented cooperative perception among vehicles of heterogeneous models. Specifically, we formalize a notion of emph{Deltatheta-Risk Increment Distribution (RID)} to capture the distribution of the risk increment by incomplete perception to the current trajectory plan, and define a Priority Index (PI) metric for prioritizing cooperative perception on riskier regions. We develop algorithms to estimate emph{Delta theta-RID} and PI at run-time with theoretical bounds. Empirical results demonstrate that Scout surpasses state-of-the-art methods and strong baselines on challenging benchmarks, achieving higher success rates with only 3-10% of their communication volume.

### [TaskExp: Enhancing Generalization of Multi-Robot Exploration with Multi-Task Pre-Training]()

We aim to develop a general multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policy that enables a group of robots to efficiently explore large-scale, unknown environments with random pose initialization. Existing MARL-based multi-robot exploration methods face challenges in reliably mapping observations to actions in large-scale scenarios and lack of zero-shot generalization to unknown environments. To this end, we propose a generic multi-task pre-training algorithm (termed TaskExp) to enhance the generalization of learning-based policies. In particular, we design a decision-related task to guide the policy to focus on valuable subspaces of the action space, improving the reliability of policy mapping. Moreover, two perception-related tasks--Location Estimation and Map Prediction--are designed to enhance the zero-shot capability of the policy by guiding it to extract general invariant features from unknown environments. With TaskExp pre-training, our policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning-based methods in large-scale scenarios and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance in unseen environments. Furthermore, TaskExp can also be easily integrated to improve the existing learning-based multi-robot exploration methods.

### [WcDT: World-Centric Diffusion Transformer for Traffic Scene Generation]()

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for autonomous driving trajectory generation by harnessing the complementary strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (a.k.a., diffusion models) and transformers. Our proposed framework, termed the "World-centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that is used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems.

### [Hybrid Decentralization for Multi-Robot Orienteering with Mothership-Passenger Systems]()

We present a hybrid centralized-decentralized planning algorithm for a multi-robot system made up of a single Mothership robot and multiple Passenger robots. In this system, the Passenger robots execute tasks while the Mothership provides support. This paper addresses the challenge of planning Passenger robot movements, framing it as a Stochastic Multi-Agent Orienteering Problem (SMOP) complicated by factors like stochastic operational efforts and disruptive events. We optimize the task completion efficiency of the system by combining centralized solutions from the Mothership with local plans from Passengers to enhance system resilience. Our contributions include defining the SMOP, developing a distributed solution using decentralized Monte Carlo tree search, presenting a hybrid algorithm that integrates centralized plans into the distributed framework, and evaluating the algorithm’s performance in simulation using real-world data. Our results show that our hybrid approaches outperform fully centralized and fully distributed algorithms in dynamic and disruptive scenarios with up to 26.6% increase in task completion efficiency over baseline methods.

### [Communication-Aware Iterative Map Compression for Online Path-Planning]()

This paper addresses the problem of optimizing communicated information among heterogeneous, resource-aware robot teams to facilitate their navigation. In such operations, a mobile robot compresses its local map to assist another robot in reaching a target within an uncharted environment. The primary challenge lies in ensuring that the map compression step balances network load while transmitting only the most essential information for effective navigation. We propose a communication framework that sequentially selects the optimal map compression in a task-driven, communication-aware manner. It introduces a decoder capable of iterative map estimation, handling noise through Kalman filter techniques. The computational speed of our decoder allows for a larger compression template set compared to previous methods, and enables applications in more challenging environments. Specifically, our simulations demonstrate a remarkable 98% reduction in communicated information, compared to a framework that transmits the raw data, on a large Mars inclination map and an Earth map, all while maintaining similar planning costs. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces computational time compared to the state-of-the-art approach.

### [DiffCP: Ultra-Low Bit Collaborative Perception Via Diffusion Model]()

Collaborative perception (CP) is emerging as a promising solution to the inherent limitations of stand-alone intelligence. However, current wireless communication systems are unable to support feature-level and raw-level collaborative algorithms due to their enormous bandwidth demands. In this paper, we propose DiffCP, a novel CP paradigm that utilizes a diffusion model to efficiently compress the sensing information of collaborators. By incorporating both geometric and semantic conditions into the generative model, DiffCP enables feature-level collaboration with an ultra-low communication cost, advancing the practical implementation of CP systems. This paradigm can be seamlessly integrated into existing CP algorithms to enhance a wide range of downstream tasks. Through extensive experimentation, we investigate the trade-offs between communication, computation, and performance. Numerical results demonstrate that DiffCP can significantly reduce communication costs by 14.5-fold while maintaining the same performance as the state-of-the-art algorithm.

### [APF-CPP: An Artificial Potential Field Based Multi-Robot Online Coverage Path Planning Approach]()

Multi-robot coverage planning has gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called APF-CPP (Artificial Potential Field Based Multi-Robot Online Coverage Path Planning) to enhance the collaboration of multi-robot systems to accomplish coverage tasks in unknown dynamic environments. Our approach presents a unique coverage policy that leverages the concept of artificial potential field (APF). In contrast to the conventional APF-based path planning methods that directly generate paths based on the field gradient, we utilize the APF to derive coverage policies for individual robots within a multi-robot system to achieve efficient task allocation and maintain regular coverage patterns. We have developed a policy update mechanism that allows the system to adapt its task allocation policy based on real-time conditions while minimizing the impact caused by policy changes. To better handle dead-end conditions, we use the APF concept to allocate tasks better during the dead-end recovery process. We also show that our algorithm has a low computational complexity and guarantees complete coverage in a finite time. We conduct extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches and validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing approaches and confirm the effectiveness and robustness of real-world implementation.

### [Exact Wavefront Propagation for Globally Optimal One-To-All Path Planning on 2D Cartesian Grids]()

This paper introduces an efficient mathcal{O}(n) compute and memory complexity algorithm for globally optimal path planning on 2D Cartesian grids. Unlike existing marching methods that rely on approximate discretized solutions to the Eikonal equation, our approach achieves exact wavefront propagation by pivoting the analytic distance function based on visibility. The algorithm leverages a dynamic-programming subroutine to efficiently evaluate visibility queries. Through benchmarking against state-of-the-art any-angle path planners, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both speed and accuracy, particularly in cluttered environments. Notably, our method inherently provides globally optimal paths to all grid points, eliminating the need for additional gradient descent steps per path query. The same capability extends to multiple starting positions. We also provide a greedy version of our algorithm as well as open-source C++ implementation of our solver.

### [ICBSS: An Improved Algorithm for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding]()

The Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding (MCPF) problem is a generalized version of the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, in which each agent must collectively visit multiple intermediate target locations on the way to their final destinations. The state-of-the-art approach for addressing MCPF, known as Conflict-Based Steiner Search (CBSS) cite{DBLP:journals/trob/RenRC23}, leverages K-best joint sequences to create multiple search trees, and employs CBS-like search to resolve collisions for each tree. Despite its optimality guarantee, CBSS is computationally burdensome due to the duplicated collision resolutions across multiple trees and the computation of the K-best joint sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm called Improved Conflict-Based Steiner Search (ICBSS), aiming at expediting CBSS by replacing the multi trees with a single conflict tree (CT), which can be implemented by interleaving the time-dependent traveling salesman algorithm to compute the optimal joint path for agents under the newly generated constraints in each CT vertex. Additionally, we introduce a sub-optimal variant of ICBSS, which improves computational efficiency at the expense of solution optimality. Empirical results show that ICBSS outperforms state-of-the-art MCPF algorithms on a variety of MAPF instances.

### [Escaping Local Minima: Hybrid Artificial Potential Field with Wall-Follower for Decentralized Multi-Robot Navigation]()

We tackle the challenge of decentralized multi-robot navigation in environments with nonconvex obstacles, where complete environmental knowledge is unavailable. While reactive methods like Artificial Potential Field (APF) offer simplicity and efficiency, they suffer from local minima, causing robots to become trapped due to their lack of global environmental awareness. Other existing solutions either rely on inter-robot communication, are limited to single-robot scenarios, or struggle to navigate nonconvex obstacles effectively. Our proposed method enables collision-free navigation using only local sensor and state information without a map. By incorporating a wall-following (WF) behavior into the APF approach, our method allows robots to escape local minima, even in the presence of nonconvex and dynamic obstacles including other robots. We introduce two algorithms for switching between APF and WF: a rule-based system and an encoder network trained on expert demonstrations. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantially higher success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to overcome the limitations of local minima in complex environments.

### [Heterogeneous Exploration and Monitoring with Online Free-Space Ellipsoid Graphs]()

This paper proposes a heterogeneous teaming solution to the problem of target discovery and monitoring in unknown, non-convex environments. The team consists of two types of agents: agile agents with sensors capable of mapping their surroundings and slower agents that are capable of monitoring or servicing discovered targets. We propose an exploration algorithm that utilizes the IRIS algorithm to generate a graph decomposition from collision free ellipses contained within the environment. This graph is passed to the monitoring agents who execute polynomial complexity assignment and touring algorithms to generate high quality path plans which service all discovered targets. Our algorithmic structure allows the team to solve the problems of exploration, target discovery, assignment, and monitoring within unknown, non-convex environments efficiently using limited information. The performance of our proposed method is verified through batch simulations and complexity analysis.

### [Wavelet-Based Distributed Coverage for Heterogeneous Agents]()

We develop a coverage approach for heterogeneous agents that leverages the different sensing and motion capabilities of a team. Coverage performance is measured using ergodicity, which when optimized balances exploitation versus exploration, where areas of interest are indicated with an information metric. Prior work uses spectral decomposition of a spatial map of information to guide a set of heterogeneous agents, each with different sensor and motion models, to optimize coverage. This work leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the information map rather than the Fourier transform typically applied to ergodic search and demonstrates the importance of selecting a suitable wavelet family to use, based on the information map being explored. Further a sequence of wavelets is used for decomposition to overcome dependency on selecting one suitable wavelet family. Our experimental results show that using wavelet families well-suited to the specific information map for information map decomposition leads to, on average, 43% improvement over a baseline method in terms of a standard coverage metric (ergodicity), while using a well-sequenced set of wavelets for decomposition leads to a 65% improvement in coverage performance across multiple types of information maps.

### [Multi-Agent Obstacle Avoidance Using Velocity Obstacles and Control Barrier Functions]()

Velocity Obstacles (VO) methods form a paradigm for collision avoidance strategies among moving obstacles and agents. While VO methods perform well in simple multi-agent environments, they do not guarantee safety and can show overly conservative behavior in common situations. In this paper, we propose to combine a VO strategy for guidance with a Control Barrier Function approach for safety, which overcomes the overly conservative behavior of VOs and formally guarantees safety. We validate our method in a baseline comparison study, using second-order integrator and car-like dynamics. Results support that our method outperforms the baselines with respect to path smoothness, collision avoidance, and success rates.

### [VALG: Vision-Based Adaptive Laser Gripper for Model-Free Pose Control of Floating Objects at Air-Liquid Interface]()

Non-contact manipulation at the air-liquid interface holds significant potential for applications in microrobotics, non-invasive assembly, and biochemistry analysis. However, achieving simultaneous position and orientation (pose) control of floating objects remains a considerable challenge, particularly for adaptive control without prior modeling of the objects. Here, we introduce the Vision-based Adaptive Laser Gripper (VALG) system addressing these challenges. By leveraging the distributed thermocapillary flow induced by patterned laser scanning, a pose control strategy based on the equidistant contour scanning laser is proposed and validated. The proposed system relies solely on visual recognition to generate adaptive laser grippers, which achieve static equilibrium to simultaneously constrain the position and orientation of the floating objects. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the VALG system in independent position and orientation control, coupled pose control, and path following. The VALG system facilitates smooth, precise, fast, and adaptive pose control of generalized floating objects, establishing it as a universal and versatile platform for non-contact manipulation at the air-liquid interface.

### [Interactive OT Gym: A Reinforcement Learning-Based Interactive Optical Tweezer (OT)-Driven Microrobotics Simulation Platform]()

Optical tweezers (OT) offer unparalleled capabilities for micromanipulation with submicron precision in biomedical applications. However, controlling conventional multi-trap OT to achieve cooperative manipulation of multiple complex-shaped microrobots in dynamic environments poses a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Interactive OT Gym, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based simulation platform designed for OT-driven microrobotics. Our platform supports complex physical field simulations and integrates haptic feedback interfaces, RL modules, and context-aware shared control strategies tailored for OT-driven microrobot in cooperative biological object manipulation tasks. This integration allows for an adaptive blend of manual and autonomous control, enabling seamless transitions between human input and autonomous operation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our platform using a cell manipulation task. Experimental results show that our shared control system significantly improves micromanipulation performance, reducing task completion time by approximately 67% compared to using pure human or RL control alone and achieving a 100% success rate. With its high fidelity, interactivity, low cost, and high-speed simulation capabilities, Interactive OT Gym serves as a user-friendly training and testing environment for the development of advanced interactive OT-driven micromanipulation systems and control algorithms.

### [Model-Based Robotic Cell Aspiration: Tackling the Impact of Air Segment]()

Cell aspiration is a common micro-manipulation technique for cell transfer, particularly in textit{in vitro} fertilization (IVF) procedures. The minuscule volume of a cell (pL) and limited damping provided by the medium make it challenging to accurately and quickly aspirate a cell to the desired position inside the micropipette. Experienced clinicians intentionally insert an air segment inside the micropipette in advance to make the aspiration easier. Nevertheless, the unclear damping effects and the varying initial length of the air segment in each aspiration pose difficulties for most operators. Inadequate judgment and response may lead to overshoot or even loss of the cell. This paper constructs a nonlinear dynamics model to elucidate the cell motion inside a micropipette containing an inserted air segment. The model reveals the impact of the air segment. A model-based controller is designed to facilitate the accurate aspiration of human sperm to a desired position, incorporating an estimated initial length of the air segment. Experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of both the model and the controller involving various initial air segment lengths. The results demonstrated a 100% success rate in 50 sperm aspiration experiments, achieving an average positional accuracy within pm2 pixels and an average settling time of 5.89 seconds.

### [Efficient Optimization of a Permanent Magnet Array for a Stable 2D Trap]()

Untethered magnetic manipulation of biomedical millirobots has a high potential for minimally invasive surgical applications. However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory. The algorithm demonstrates high scalability by optimizing the angles for 100 magnets in under three seconds. Moreover, the optimization workflow can be adapted to optimize a permanent magnet array to achieve the desired force vector fields.

### [Real-Time 3D MPI-Based Navigation Scheme for Microrobots with Flexible Field Free Point Trajectories and Virtual FFP Intuitive Manipulation]()

Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI)-based navigation shows significant potential for accurately guiding microrobots to desired target locations. Existing MPI-based navigation systems have been limited to two-dimensional planar movements due to increased computational load and a lack of efficient 3D actuator schemes. So we introduce a real-time 3D MPI-based navigation scheme for microrobot, utilizing a flexible field-free point (FFP) trajectory scanning scheme and 3D virtual FFP (vFFP) intuitive manipulation. The FFP trajectory is chosen flexibly to enhance temporal resolution. A virtual FFP force model for actuator function, with high potential for interactive manipulation, is used to linearize the magnetic force concerning the relative positions of microrobot and the actual FFP. The proposed concept has been validated using the available 3D amplitude modulation MPI system with a 90 mm bore size and a 4 T/m/µ0 gradient. By employing a flexible FFP trajectory, the MPI system can achieve an image sampling rate of up to 4 Hz for a 3D Field of View of 60  40  60 mm³, enabling real-time MPI-based navigation. Furthermore, the proposed navigation control strategy can reach any target outlet within the 3D blood model with a low mean error in vFFP linearization of less than 5%.

### [3D Noncontact Micro-Particle Manipulation with Acoustic Robot End-Effector under Microscope]()

As an essential component of noncontact manipulation, acoustic manipulation has achieved great success in multidisciplinary research and applications. Although acoustic tweezers have made advancements in manipulating particles in air, handling individual particles with high precision in water remains challenging and inadequately addressed due to the difficulty in precisely characterizing and calibrating acoustic robot end-effectors from a robotic perspective. In this paper, we present a vision-based automated noncontact particle manipulation approach using an acoustic robot end-effector, which achieves precise and reliable particle manipulation in 3D space. Specifically, visual feedback is incorporated for microparticle localization, and a dynamic acoustic field modulation method is proposed for controlling the end-effector. The invisible robot end-effector is localized and characterized through hydrophone scanning. The proposed vision solution is capable of automated trapping and precise translation of micro-particles suspended in a water-based environment and is applicable to particles with both negative and positive impedance contrast against the medium. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach towards automated noncontact particle manipulation with an acoustic robot end-effector

### [Dynamic Collaborative Workspace Based on Human Interference Estimation for Safe and Productive Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Collaborative robots that operate safely close to workers without fences have attracted attention, but few examples of such human-robot collaboration (HRC) have been seen in factories. The main reason is the difficulty in balancing safety and productivity. Current fenceless HRC systems stop the robot when a human enters the collaborative workspace (C) where both human and robot can work to ensure safety, which ISO/TS15066 regulates. The robot stops even when the human is far enough away, so productivity is drastically decreased (FCW, Fixed C). If a system could identify the human-work area, designate it as a no-entry space in C for the robot (C^P), and dynamically set the closed C (C^C) with shrinking C by C^P, productivity would improve thanks to enabling the robot to work in C^C and safety would be ensured thanks to allowing the human to continue working in C^P. In this study, we propose a new concept of a dynamic collaborative workspace (DCW) that dynamically sets C^C and C^P based on the human’s predicted trajectory. It also provides visual and auditory prompts to enable the human to understand DCW states, i.e., when a human enters C, C is changed, and the robot is in emergency mode. We compared four HRC systems using a real robot arm: two conventional FCW ones with and without fences and two proposed DCW ones with and without a state indicator and found that the proposed system with a state indicator has the best productivity and ensures the same level of safety as the conventional system with fences.

### [Next-Best-Trajectory Planning of Robot Manipulators for Effective Observation and Exploration]()

Visual observation of objects is essential for many robotic applications, such as object reconstruction and manipulation, navigation, and scene understanding. Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy’s effectiveness.

### [Open-Nav: Exploring Zero-Shot Vision-And-Language Navigation in Continuous Environment with Open-Source LLMs]()

Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.

### [Integrating Field of View in Human-Aware Collaborative Planning]()

In human-robot collaboration (HRC), it is crucial for robot agents to consider humans' knowledge of their surroundings. In reality, humans possess a narrow field of view (FOV), limiting their perception. However, research on HRC often overlooks this aspect and presumes an omniscient human collaborator. Our study addresses the challenge of adapting to the evolving subtask intent of humans while accounting for their limited FOV. We integrate FOV within the human-aware probabilistic planning framework. To account for large state spaces due to considering FOV, we propose a hierarchical online planner that efficiently finds approximate solutions while enabling the robot to explore low-level action trajectories that enter the human FOV, influencing their intended subtask. Through user study with our adapted cooking domain, we demonstrate our FOV-aware planner reduces human's interruptions and redundant actions during collaboration by adapting to human perception limitations. We extend these findings to a virtual reality kitchen environment, where we observe similar collaborative behaviors.

### [Improving Human-Robot Collaboration Via Computational Design]()

When robots enter our day-to-day lives, the shared space surrounding humans and robots is critical for facilitating Human-Robot collaboration. The design of shared space should satisfy humans' preferences and robots' efficiency. This work uses the kitchen as an example to illustrate the importance of good space designs in enhancing collaboration. Given the kitchen boundary, food stations, counters, andrecipes, the proposed method determines the optimal placement of stations and counters that meet the requirements of kitchen design rules and improve performance. The key technical challenge is that the optimization method usually evaluates thousands of designs, and each evaluation analyzes the traffic flow of the space, which must solve many motion planning problems. To address this technical challenge, we use a decentralized motion planner that can solve multi-agent motion planning efficiently. Our results indicate that optimized kitchen designs can provide noticeable performance improvement to Human-Robot collaboration.

The proposed angle measurement model and external torque measurement model are evaluated by rigorous experiments. The experimental results indicate that the designed mechanism shows excellent repeatability and accuracy. The average error for all angles is less than 1 degree, and the average maximum relative error for torque is 4.43%.

### [BODex: Scalable and Efficient Robotic Dexterous Grasp Synthesis Using Bilevel Optimization]()

Robotic dexterous grasping is important for interacting with the environment. To unleash the potential of data-driven models for dexterous grasping, a large-scale, high-quality dataset is essential. While gradient-based optimization offers a promising way for constructing such datasets, previous works suffer from limitations, such as inefficiency, strong assumptions in the grasp quality energy, or limited object sets for experiments. Moreover, the lack of a standard benchmark for comparing different methods and datasets hinders progress in this field. To address these challenges, we develop a highly efficient synthesis system and a comprehensive benchmark with MuJoCo for dexterous grasping. We formulate grasp synthesis as a bilevel optimization problem, combining a novel lower-level quadratic programming (QP) with an upper-level gradient descent process. By leveraging recent advances in CUDA-accelerated robotic libraries and GPU-based QP solvers, our system can parallelize thousands of grasps and synthesize over 49 grasps per second on a single 3090 GPU. Our synthesized grasps for Shadow, Allegro, and Leap hands all achieve a success rate above 75% in simulation, with a penetration depth under 1 mm, outperforming existing baselines on nearly all metrics. Compared to the previous large-scale dataset, DexGraspNet, our dataset significantly improves the performance of learning models, with a success rate from around 40% to 80% in simulation. Real-world testing of the trained model on the Shadow Hand achieves an 81% success rate across 20 diverse objects.

### [Canonical Representation and Force-Based Pretraining of 3D Tactile for Dexterous Visuo-Tactile Policy Learning]()

Tactile sensing plays a vital role in enabling robots to perform fine-grained, contact-rich tasks. However, the high dimensionality of tactile data, due to the large coverage on dexterous hands, poses significant challenges for effective tactile feature learning, especially for 3D tactile data, as there are no large standardized datasets and no strong pretrained backbones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel canonical representation that reduces the difficulty of 3D tactile feature learning and further introduces a force-based self-supervised pretraining task to capture both local and net force features, which are crucial for dexterous manipulation. Our method achieves an average success rate of 78% across four fine-grained, contact-rich dexterous manipulation tasks in real-world experiments, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness compared to other methods. Further analysis shows that our method fully utilizes both spatial and force information from 3D tactile data to accomplish the tasks. The videos can be viewed at https://3dtacdex.github.io.

### [Dynamic Compact Consensus Tracking for Aerial Robots]()

Existing one-stream trackers have attracted widespread attention. However, they are not applicable in realtime UAV tracking systems due to substantial computational overhead, especially when dynamic templates are introduced. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dynamic Compact Consensus Tracker (DC2T), constructed by stacking modules that each consists of a Compact Token Encoder (CTE) and Dynamic Consensus Attention (DCA). Unlike traditional methods that convert images into a large number of tokens, the CTE, inspired by ”superpixel”, extracts a compact set of representative tokens from both initial and dynamic templates, eliminating the need for a large token set. This strategic reduction in the number of compact tokens markedly decreases the computational load of CTE, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent attention operations. To achieve near-linear complexity of the DCA, compact dynamic template tokens (as keys) are re-queried by search tokens (as queries) to perform dynamic consensus on the aggregated tokens (as values). This arrangement seamlessly incorporates dynamic spatio-temporal features into the DCA while avoiding the computational burden typically associated with dynamic templates. With the aim of further enhancing the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, a direct control network is crafted to seamlessly incorporate the prediction of high-level control values into the tracking network, ensuring a cohesive and efficient interaction with the controller. Comprehensive experiments and real-world evaluations have proven DC2T’s superior performance, accompanied by a significant reduction in FLOPs. Furthermore, we have conducted experiments that demonstrate the tracker’s ability to integrate seamlessly with other technologies such as SLAM and detection, enabling precise tracking of arbitrary objects. The tracker code will be released in https://github.com/xiaolousun/refine-pytracking.git.

### [CGTrack: Cascade Gating Network with Hierarchical Feature Aggregation for UAV Tracking]()

Recent advancements in visual object tracking have markedly improved the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, which is a critical component in real-world robotics applications. While the integration of hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these issues, we in this paper introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which combines both explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing feature representation. Based on this, we design a novel Lightweight Gated Center Head (LGCH) that utilizes gating mechanisms to decouple target-oriented coordinates from previously expanded features, which contain dense local discriminative information. Extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that CGTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while running fast.

### [Tracking Everything in Robotic-Assisted Surgery]()

Accurate tracking of tissues and instruments in videos is crucial for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS), as it enables the robot to comprehend the surgical scene with precise locations and interactions of tissues and tools. Traditional keypoint-based sparse tracking is limited by featured points, while flow-based dense two-view matching suffers from long-term drifts. Recently, the Tracking Any Point (TAP) algorithm was proposed to overcome these limitations and achieve dense accurate long-term tracking. However, its efficacy in surgical scenarios remains untested, largely due to the lack of a comprehensive surgical tracking dataset for evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce a new annotated surgical tracking dataset for benchmarking tracking methods for surgical scenarios, comprising real-world surgical videos with complex tissue and instrument motions. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAP-based algorithms on this dataset and reveal their limitations in challenging surgical scenarios, including fast instrument motion, severe occlusions, and motion blur, etc. Furthermore, we propose a new tracking method, namely SurgMotion, to solve the challenges and further improve the tracking performance. Our proposed method outperforms most TAP-based algorithms in surgical instruments tracking, and especially demonstrates significant improvements over baselines in challenging medical videos.

Vision-Language MOT is a critical tracking problem that has recently garnered increasing attention. It aims to track objects based on human language commands, displacing the traditional use of templates or pre-set information from training sets in conventional tracking tasks. However, a key challenge remains in understanding why language is used for tracking, hindering further development. In this paper, we introduce Language-Guided MOT, a unified task framework, and LaMOT, a corresponding large-scale benchmark, which encompasses diverse scenarios and language descriptions and comprises 1,660 sequences from 4 different datasets. The purpose of LaMOT is to unify various Vision-Language MOT tasks while providing a standardized evaluation platform. To ensure high-quality annotations, we manually assign appropriate descriptive texts to each target in every video and conduct careful inspection and correction. To our knowledge, LaMOT is the first benchmark dedicated to Language-Guided MOT. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective tracker, termed LaMOTer. By establishing a unified task framework, providing challenging benchmarks, and offering insights for future algorithm design and evaluation, we expect to contribute to the advancement of research in Vision-Language MOT. We will release the data at https://github.com/Nathan-Li123/LaMOT.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage has rapidly increased leading to an effort to accurately and efficiently track UAVs. Many existing approaches utilize YOLO, a state-of-the art object detection model, in conjunction with object tracking algorithms to detect and follow UAVs in real-time. However, these systems typically focus on a single method, without considering alternative tracking methods. In this paper, we present an experimental comparison of multiple object tracking algorithms integrated with YOLOv8, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their performance in UAV tracking scenarios. First, the model size was optimized to determine the best balance between speed and accuracy. Then, various tracking methods are tested to determine the most effective combination. The YOLOv8 model combined with a Kernelized Correlation Filter outperformed various other trackers in varying environmental scenarios, with a combined success rate and tracking accuracy of 0.8041. This approach was further implemented in real-time on a Jetson Orion Nano GPU, utilizing a pan-tilt gimbal and an Intel RealSense D435i camera. Running at 20 FPS, the system demonstrated robustness and stability during motion and various environmental scenarios, highlighting its potential for integration into applications such as ground-based UAV surveillance.

### [MoD-SLAM: Monocular Dense Mapping for Unbounded 3D Scene Reconstruction]()

Monocular SLAM has received a lot of attention due to its simple RGB inputs and the lifting of complex sensor constraints. However, existing monocular SLAM systems lack accurate depth estimation, which limits theaccuracy of tracking and mapping performance. To address this limitation, we propose MoD-SLAM, the first monocular NeRF-based dense mapping method that allows 3D reconstruction in real-time in unbounded scenes. Specifically, we introduce a depth estimation module in the front-end to extract accurate priori depth values to supervise mapping and tracking processes. This strategy is essential to improve the SLAM performance. Moreover, a Gaussian-based unbounded scene representation approach is designed to solve the challenge of mapping scenes without boundaries. By introducing a robust depth loss term into the tracking process, our SLAM system achieves more precise pose estimation in large-scale scenes. Our experiments on two standard datasets show that MoD-SLAM achieves competitive performance, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction and localization by up to 30% and 15% respectively compared with existing monocular SLAM systems.

### [A Certifiable Algorithm for Simultaneous Shape Estimation and Object Tracking]()

Applications from manipulation to autonomous vehicles rely on robust and general object tracking to safely perform tasks in dynamic environments. We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.

### [Hypergraph-Transformer (HGT) for Interaction Event Prediction in Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery]()

Understanding and anticipating events and actions is critical for intraoperative assistance and decision-making during minimally invasive surgery. We propose a predictive neural network that is capable of understanding and predicting critical interaction aspects of surgical workflow based on endoscopic, intracorporeal video data, while flexibly leveraging surgical knowledge graphs. The approach incorporates a hypergraph-transformer (HGT) structure that encodes expert knowledge into the network design and predicts the hidden embedding of the graph. We verify our approach on established surgical datasets and applications, including the prediction of action-triplets, and the achievement of the Critical View of Safety (CVS), which is a critical safety measure. Moreover, we address specific, safety-related forecasts of surgical processes, such as predicting the clipping of the cystic duct or artery without prior achievement of the CVS. Our results demonstrate improvement in prediction of interactive event when incorporating with our approach compared to unstructured alternatives.

### [Robotic Flexible Magnetic Retractor for Dynamic Tissue Manipulation in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection]()

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a procedure targeted for early gastrointestinal cancer. Traction plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of cutting lesions, thereby reducing procedural complexity and duration. From the perspective of traction devices, current non-magnetic ones hold shortcomings in complicating the workspace in directional tissue manipulation; Current magnetic traction devices cannot be prepared before the procedure, and require the withdrawal of endoscope in the midway to re-introduce the magnetic retractor to the lesion site. Towards these plights, this paper introduces a robotic flexible magnetic retractor designed for tissue manipulation during ESD. Precisely, the flexible prototype can be seamlessly inserted through the instrument channel of an endoscope to the lesion site without the need for endoscope withdrawal. Moreover, the introduction of robotic magnetic actuation enhances the agile control of magnetic retractors while alleviating the surgeon’s workload in magnetic-retractorassisted ESD. The experimental results validate the functionality and efficacy of the prototype magnetic retractor in magnetic traction-assisted ESD procedures. The retractor demonstrated its ability to provide adequate traction and accomplish clinical tasks. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the efficiency and outcomes of ESD procedures, offering a compelling alternative to traditional traction methods.

Surgical procedures are inherently complex and dynamic, with intricate dependencies and various execution paths. Accurate identification of the intentions behind critical actions, referred to as Primary Intentions (PIs), is crucial to understanding and planning the procedure. This paper presents a novel framework that advances PI recognition in instructional videos by combining top-down grammatical structure with bottom-up visual cues. The grammatical structure is based on a rich corpus of surgical procedures, offering a hierarchical perspective on surgical activities. A grammar parser, utilizing the surgical activity grammar, processes visual data obtained from laparoscopic images through surgical action detectors, ensuring a more precise interpretation of the visual information. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing surgical activity detectors that rely solely on visual features. Our research provides a promising foundation for developing advanced robotic surgical systems with enhanced planning and automation capabilities.

### [SLAM Assisted 3D Tracking System for Laparoscopic Surgery]()

A major limitation of minimally invasive surgery is the difficulty in accurately locating the internal anatomical structures of the target organ due to the lack of tactile feedback and transparency. Augmented reality (AR) offers a promising solution to overcome this challenge. Numerous studies have shown that combining learning-based and geometric methods can achieve accurate preoperative and intraoperative data registration. This work proposes a real-time monocular 3D tracking algorithm for post-registration tasks. The ORB-SLAM2 framework is adopted and modified for prior-based 3D tracking. The primitive 3D shape is used for fast initialization of the ORB-SLAM2 monocular mode. A pseudo-segmentation strategy is employed to separate the target organ from the background for tracking, and the 3D shape is incorporated as a geometric prior in its pose graph optimization. Experiments from in-vivo and ex-vivo tests demonstrate that the proposed 3D tracking system provides robust 3D tracking and effectively handles typical challenges such as fast motion, out-of-field-of-view scenarios, partial visibility, and ''organ-background'' relative motion.

### [SurgPose: Generalisable Surgical Instrument Pose Estimation Using Zero-Shot Learning and Stereo Vision]()

Accurate pose estimation of surgical tools in Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) is essential for surgical navigation and robot control. While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.

### [Design and Effectiveness of Virtual Monitors and AR-Based Endoscope Control for Robotically Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery]()

Managing indirect access in laparoscopy as a minimally invasive procedure poses challenges to physicians. In particular, an endoscope must be navigated to achieve adequate visualization of the surgical anatomy, while coping with unergonomic poses, tremor, and fatigue. Furthermore, the alignment of visual perception and physical movement, dictated by the endoscope's position relative to the monitor, can lead to hand-eye coordination challenges. We propose unified deployment of a robotic endoscope holder together with an augmented reality display to counteract the aforementioned challenges in laparoscopy. Our augmented reality system provides an interactive, stereoscopic, virtual monitor displaying an endoscopic stream. In addition, our method design enables direct control of the robotic endoscope holder. Our user study demonstrates the potential of the proposed method to significantly improve hand-eye coordination, while insights from our usability study for robotic control indicate promising trends, including high usability and low cognitive demand.

### [MEDiC: Autonomous Surgical Robotic Assistance to Maximizing Exposure for Dissection and Cautery]()

Surgical automation has the capability to improve the consistency of patient outcomes and broaden access to advanced surgical care in underprivileged communities. Shared autonomy, where the robot automates routine subtasks while the surgeon retains partial teleoperative control, offers great potential to make an impact. In this paper we focus on one important skill within surgical shared autonomy: Automating robotic assistance to maximize visual exposure and apply tissue tension for dissection and cautery. Ensuring consistent exposure to visualize the surgical site is crucial for both efficiency and patient safety. However, achieving this is highly challenging due to the complexities of manipulating deformable volumetric tissues that are prevalent in surgery. To address these challenges we propose MEDiC, a framework for autonomous surgical robotic assistance to maximizing exposure for dissection and cautery. We integrate a differentiable physics model with perceptual feedback to achieve our two key objectives: 1) Maximizing tissue exposure and applying tension for a specified dissection site through visual-servoing conrol and 2) Selecting optimal control positions for a dissection target based on deformable Jacobian analysis. We quantitatively assess our method through repeated real robot experiments on a tissue phantom, and showcase its capabilities through dissection experiments using shared autonomy on real animal tissue.

### [DeformPAM: Data-Efficient Learning for Long-Horizon Deformable Object Manipulation Via Preference-Based Action Alignment]()

In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic manipulation. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data. Code and data will be available at deform-pam.robotflow.ai.

### [Autonomous Bimanual Manipulation of Deformable Objects Using Deep Reinforcement Learning Guided Adaptive Control]()

Deformable object manipulation (DOM) which is a common subtask in various surgical procedures represents an inevitable challenge in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) due to complex nonlinear deformation. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning guided adaptive control (RLAC) model-free framework, which combines learning-based and Jacobian-based methods. To complement each other for optimized performance, we harness the sampling of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy explored in simulations to solve a reasonable estimation of the initial deformation Jacobian. In early control iterations, the actions suggested by the DRL agent are adopted until the estimated real-time Jacobian approximates the actual deformation model. Subsequently, the independent Jacobian-based adaptive control (AC) with sufficient initial deformation awareness begins execution to achieve precise internal feature manipulation on deformable objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more efficient positioning and exhibits near-optimal positioning paths. RLAC with robust sim-to-real performance provides a feasible approach for the complex autonomous DOM in the real world.

### [Embedded IPC: Fast and Intersection-Free Simulation in Reduced Subspace for Robot Manipulation]()

Physics-based simulation is essential for developing and evaluating robot manipulation policies, particularly in scenarios involving deformable objects and complex contact interactions. However, existing simulators often struggle to balance computational efficiency with numerical accuracy, especially when modeling deformable materials with frictional contact constraints. We introduce an efficient subspace representation for the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method, leveraging model reduction to decrease the number of degrees of freedom. Our approach decouples simulation complexity from the resolution of the input model by representing elasticity in a low-resolution subspace while maintaining collision constraints on an embedded high-resolution surface. Our barrier formulation ensures intersection-free trajectories and configurations regardless of material stiffness, time step size, or contact severity. We validate our simulator through quantitative experiments with a soft bubble gripper grasping and qualitative demonstrations of placing a plate on a dish rack. The results demonstrate our simulator's efficiency, physical accuracy, computational stability, and robust handling of frictional contact, making it well-suited for generating demonstration data and evaluating downstream robot training applications.

### [A Highly Robust Contact Sensor for Precise Contact Detection of Fabric]()

Automation in the apparel and textile industry has long been a pursuit. However, accurately locating the surface of a fabric remains a challenge, limiting the automation in sorting, packaging, and other processes. When humans locate clothing, they rely on contact feedback for the exact position of the clothing surface. As existing contact detection solutions are significantly affected by environmental factors, it is essential to develop a sensor with robust contact detection capabilities. In this work, we introduce a contact sensor with high robustness and high force resolution. This contact sensor detects contact by measuring the deformation of an elastomer using a distance-measuring module. Based on the deformation characteristics of the elastomer, we designed a detection algorithm that not only reduces the noise of data but also extracts features such as trends and elastomer states, enabling reliable contact detection. Through experiments, we validated that this contact sensor can detect contact forces as low as 0.017 N and is robust to external interference or sensor movement. We also verified that the sensor can process data within 7.5 ms and return contact detection with 95% accuracy. Additionally, we assessed its effectiveness in real fabric contact scenarios.

This study presents a novel approach to fabric manipulation through the development and optimization of a single-actuator-driven roller gripper. Focused on addressing the challenges inherent in handling fabrics with diverse thicknesses and materials, our gripper employs a passive adaptable mechanism driven by springs, enabling effective manipulation of fabrics ranging from 0.1mm to 2.25mm in thickness. We analyze gripper-fabric interaction forces to identify the parameters that influence successful grasping. We then optimize the gripper’s normal forces and the roller’s tangential force using the proposed model. Systematic evaluations demonstrated the gripper’s capability to separate individual layers from fabric stacks, achieving a 94.9% success rate across multiple fabric types. Overall, this research offers a compact, cost-effective solution with broad applicability in diverse industrial automation contexts, providing valuable insights for advancing robotic fabric handling systems.

### [Closed-Loop Shape Control of Deformable Linear Objects Based on Cosserat Model]()

The robotic shape control of deformable linear objects has garnered increasing interest within the robotics community. Despite recent progress, the majority of shape control approaches can be classified into two main groups: open-loop control, which relies on physically realistic models to represent the object, and closed-loop control, which employs less precise models alongside visual data to compute commands. In this work, we present a novel 3D shape control approach that includes the physically realistic Cosserat model into a closedloop control framework, using vision feedback to rectify errors in real-time. This approach capitalizes on the advantages of both groups: the realism and precision provided by physics-based models, and the rapid computation, therefore enabling real-time correction of model errors, and robustness to elastic parameter estimation inherent in vision-based approaches. This is achieved by computing a deformation Jacobian derived from both the Cosserat model and visual data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we conduct a series of shape control experiments where robots are tasked with deforming linear objects towards a desired shape.

In haptic object discrimination, the effect of gripper embodiment, action parameters, and sensory channels has not been systematically studied. We used two anthropomorphic hands and two 2-finger grippers to grasp two sets of deformable objects. On the object classification task, we found: (i) among classifiers, SVM on sensory features and LSTM on raw time series performed best across all grippers; (ii) faster compression speeds degraded performance; (iii) generalization to different grasping configurations was limited; transfer to different compression speeds worked well for the Barrett Hand only. Visualization of the feature spaces using PCA showed that the gripper morphology and the action parameters were the main source of variance, rendering generalization across embodiment or grasp configurations very hard. On the highly challenging dataset consisting of polyurethane foams alone, only the Barrett Hand achieved excellent performance. Tactile sensors can thus provide a key advantage even if recognition is based on stiffness rather than shape. The dataset with 24000 measurements is publicly available.

### [Introducing Mag-Nets: Rapidly Bending Electromagnetic Actuators for Self-Contained Soft Robots]()

Present electromagnetic soft actuators rely on external magnetic fields or power supplies, while the very few that operate autonomously produce weak actuating forces, limiting their practicality. This work introduces a novel current-controlled electromagnetic actuator that employs copper coils and permanent magnets to produce substantial driving forces. The actuator can serve as a building block for independently controlled actuating networks to develop sophisticated self-contained soft robots and grippers. The design, inspired by fast pneu-net (fPN) actuators, ensures minimal bending resistance from the silicone body and, thus, allows high-speed bending motions. Two applications of the prototype actuator are studied; a two-fingered soft gripper realizing bending speeds of up to 1491°/s and maximum grasping force of 1.19 N, and an entirely self-contained crawling soft robot utilizing friction anisotropy to generate forward locomotion. A lumped-element model is developed and validated experimentally to describe the dynamics of the gripper’s soft finger. Pick-and-place tasks on various targets, and tests on the crawling robot demonstrate, overall, the effectiveness of the developed actuator. The uniqueness of Mag-Nets, lying in their control simplicity, enhanced capability and cost-effectiveness, sets the foundations for a new design approach for soft robots and grippers.

### [Miniature Dielectric Elastomer Actuator Probe Inspecting Confined Spaces Embedding a CMOS Sensor]()

Navigating and inspecting confined space is crucial for the aerospace and healthcare industries. Exploring smaller and narrower spaces allows for problems to be identified earlier, preventing negative outcomes for patients and equipment. The challenge is to scale down the navigation probe while preserving degrees of freedom (DOF) and functionality. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising probe candidates because they are solid-state, electrical-driven, and can be scaled down favorably. This work demonstrates a modular 2-DOF DEA miniature probe with an embedded CMOS sensor for visual data acquisition. The modularity achieved by a novel hinge system enables switching between single and dual DEA probes based on 2D or 3D pathway structures. The probes can be controlled using a pocket-sized circuit with two knobs to turn. We present the operating mechanism, device assembly, fabrication, and characterization of DEA bending actuators with widths below 2mm. In the end, we demonstrate the ability of devices to navigate through various complex and confined pathways.

### [Portable, High-Frequency, and High-Voltage Control Circuits for Untethered Miniature Robots Driven by Dielectric Elastomer Actuators]()

In this work, we propose a high-voltage, high-frequency control circuit for the untethered applications of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). The circuit board leverages low-voltage resistive components connected in series to control voltages of up to 1.8 kV within a compact size, suitable for frequencies ranging from 0 to 1 kHz. A single-channel control board weighs only 2.5 g. We tested the performance of the control circuit under different load conditions and power supplies. Based on this control circuit, along with a commercial miniature high-voltage power converter, we construct an untethered crawling robot driven by a cylindrical DEA. The 42-g untethered robots successfully obtained crawling locomotion on a bench and within a pipeline at a driving frequency of 15 Hz, while simultaneously transmitting real-time video data via an onboard camera and antenna. Our work provides a practical way to use low-voltage control electronics to achieve the untethered driving of DEAs, and therefore portable and wearable devices.

### [Stretchable Electrohydraulic Artificial Muscle for Full Motion Ranges in Musculoskeletal Antagonistic Joints]()

Artificial muscles play a crucial role in musculoskeletal robotics and prosthetics to approximate the force-generating functionality of biological muscle. However, current artificial muscle systems are typically limited to either contraction or extension, not both. This limitation hinders the development of fully functional artificial musculoskeletal systems. We address this challenge by introducing an artificial antagonistic muscle system capable of both contraction and extension. Our design integrates non-stretchable electrohydraulic soft actuators (HASELs) with electrostatic clutches within an antagonistic musculoskeletal framework. This configuration enables an antagonistic joint to achieve a full range of motion without displacement loss due to tendon slack. We implement a synchronization method to coordinate muscle and clutch units, ensuring smooth motion profiles and speeds. This approach facilitates seamless transitions between antagonistic muscles at operational frequencies of up to 3.2 Hz. While our prototype utilizes electrohydraulic actuators, this muscle-clutch concept is adaptable to other non-stretchable artificial muscles, such as McKibben actuators, expanding their capability for extension and full range of motion in antagonistic setups. Our design represents a significant advancement in the development of fundamental components for more functional and efficient artificial musculoskeletal systems, bringing their capabilities closer to those of their biological counterparts.

### [Beyond Traversing in a Thin Pipe: Self-Sensing Odometry of a Pipeline Robot Driven by High-Frequency Dielectric Elastomer Actuators]()

In this paper, we propose an earthworm-inspired miniature pipeline robot capable of self-sensing odometry. The robot features a dielectric elastomer actuator as its elongation body and two specially designed passive anchors to achieve unidirectional motion without slipping. The odometry was achieved through the self-sensing scheme of DEAs and the summation of all step sizes over a period. The careful implementation of the self-sensing method resulted in a small sensing resolution of 0.05 mm at a high actuation frequency of 20 Hz for a cylindrical DEA. Finally, the robot obtained a self-sensing odometry in a pipe, showing good consistency with the ground truth. This work paves a new way for a miniature in-pipe robot to sense its own state without additional sensors to save space and power.

### [High-Force Electroadhesion Based on Unique Liquid-Solid Dielectrics for UAV Perching]()

Electroadhesion (EA), as an electrostatically driven, controllable adhesion technology, has unique attributes such as low noise, robust adaptability, and energy efficiency. However, its adhesion pressure is still low (0.1~10kPa) which may significantly limit its applications. This paper presents an innovative electroadhesion pad embedded with liquid and solid dielectrics. The experiments demonstrate that this liquid-solid electroadhesion pad (LSEAP) is capable of much larger adhesion pressure, compared to the traditional solid electroadhesion pad (SEAP). On one hand, the LSEAP can increase the dielectric contact with the substrate. On the other hand, the actuator can increase its dielectric strength. We also explore application of this actuator to perching of a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), in order to promote the UAV’s sustainable flight. Notably, the untethered LSEAP system, with an adhesion area as small as 4 cm² and a self-weight as light as 8.7 g, can support a UAV of 249.7 g for stable adhesion on various surfaces. The adhesion pressure generated by our LSEAD can be 32.2kPa, significantly larger than those reported in the literature. The weight ratio of the UAV to the LSEAP system is 14.6, more than double those in the previous studies. The integration of this EA system markedly prolongs the operational duration of UAVs, rendering them suitable for sustainable surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This LSEAP also marks a pivotal advancement towards adhesion-based applications such as grippers and wall-climbing robots.

### [Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks with Class-Normalized Logit Clipping for Robust Sea State Estimation from Noisy Ship Motion Data]()

Autonomous ships utilize automation systems to achieve unmanned navigation, driving innovation in maritime transportation. However, sea conditions, inffuenced by dynamic factors such as wave height, wind speed, and ocean currents, present a challenge in accurately assessing these conditions. Traditional classification models often assume accurate labels, but noisy labels are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as noise sample filtering or loss function adjustment, have limited applicability and poor generalization when dealing with complex sea condition data. To address this issue, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network model. The model’s feature extraction module uses deep representation learning to capture latent patterns in the data, and a loss function is designed to mitigate the impact of outliers. The integration of these components allows the model to perform accurate classification even in the presence of noisy labels. Extensive experiments on public and sea condition datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating that the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and holds great promise for practical applications.

### [Directed-CP: Directed Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Via Proactive Attention]()

Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to expand an ego vehicle’s field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods do expand the ego vehicle’s 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, but faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Directed-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle’s directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks.

### [Motion Forecasting Via Model-Based Risk Minimization]()

Forecasting the future trajectories of surrounding agents is crucial for autonomous vehicles to ensure safe, efficient, and comfortable route planning. While model en- sembling has improved prediction accuracy in various fields, its application in trajectory prediction is limited due to the multi-modal nature of predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling method applicable to trajectory prediction based on the predictions of multiple models. We first show that conventional sampling based on predicted probabilities can degrade performance due to missing alignment between models. To address this problem, we introduce a new method that generates optimal trajectories from a set of neural networks, framing it as a risk minimization problem with a variable loss function. By using state-of-the-art models as base learners, our approach constructs diverse and effective ensembles for optimal trajectory sampling. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes prediction dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving top ranks on the leaderboard. We also provide a comprehensive empirical study on ensembling strategies, offering insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced ensembling techniques in trajectory prediction, significantly improving predictive performance and paving the way for more reliable predicted trajectories.

### [Computational Teaching for Driving Via Multi-Task Imitation Learning]()

Learning motor skills for sports or performance driving is often done with professional instruction from expert human teachers, whose availability is limited. Our goal is to enable automated teaching via a learned model that interacts with the student similar to a human teacher. However, training such automated teaching systems is limited by the availability of high-quality annotated datasets of expert teacher and student interactions as they are difficult to collect at scale. To address this data scarcity problem, we propose an approach for training a coaching system for complex motor tasks such as high performance driving via a Multi-Task Imitation Learning (MTIL) paradigm. MTIL allows our model to learn robust representations by utilizing self supervised training signals from more readily available non- interactive datasets of humans performing the task of interest. We validate our approach with (1) a semi-synthetic dataset created from real human driving trajectories, (2) a professional track driving instruction dataset, (3) a track racing driving simulator human-subject study, and (4) a system demonstration on an instrumented car at a race track.Our experiments show that the right set of auxiliary machine learning tasks improves prediction of teaching instructions. Moreover, in the human subjects study, students exposed to the instructions from our teaching system improve their ability to stay within track limits, and show favorable perception of the model’s interaction with them, in terms of usefulness and satisfaction.

### [A Comprehensive LLM-Powered Framework for Driving Intelligence Evaluation]()

Evaluation methods for autonomous driving are crucial for algorithm optimization. However, due to the complexity of driving intelligence, there is currently no comprehensive evaluation method for the level of autonomous driving intelligence. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for driving behavior intelligence in complex traffic environments, aiming to fill this gap. We constructed a natural language evaluation dataset of human professional drivers and passengers through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving behavior evaluation interviews. Based on this dataset, we developed an LLM-powered driving evaluation framework. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through simulated experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human assessment. Our research provides valuable insights for evaluating and designing more intelligent, human-like autonomous driving agents. The implementation details of the framework and detailed information about the dataset can be found at the Github.

### [LoRD: Adapting Differentiable Driving Policies to Distribution Shifts]()

Distribution shifts between operational domains can severely affect the performance of learned models in self-driving vehicles (SDVs). While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks (structured policy) consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.

### [BehAV: Behavioral Rule Guided Autonomy Using VLMs for Robot Navigation in Outdoor Scenes]()

We present BehAV, a novel approach for autonomous robot navigation in outdoor scenes guided by human instructions and leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our method interprets human commands using a Large Language Model (LLM) and categorizes the instructions into navigation and behavioral guidelines. Navigation guidelines consist of directional commands (e.g., "move forward until") and associated landmarks (e.g., "the building with blue windows"), while behavioral guidelines encompass regulatory actions (e.g., "stay on") and their corresponding objects (e.g., "pavements"). We use VLMs for their zero-shot scene understanding capabilities to estimate landmark locations from RGB images for robot navigation. Further, we introduce a novel scene representation that utilizes VLMs to ground behavioral rules into a behavioral cost map. This cost map encodes the presence of behavioral objects within the scene and assigns costs based on their regulatory actions. The behavioral cost map is integrated with a LiDAR-based occupancy map for navigation. To navigate outdoor scenes while adhering to the instructed behaviors, we present an unconstrained Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based planner that prioritizes both reaching landmarks and following behavioral guidelines. We evaluate the performance of BehAV on a quadruped robot across diverse real-world scenarios, demonstrating a 22.49% improvement in alignment with human-teleoperated actions, as measured by Fréchet distance, and achieving a 40% higher navigation success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [An Adaptive Graduated Nonconvexity Loss Function for Robust Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions]()

Many problems in robotics, such as estimating the state from noisy sensor data or aligning two point clouds, can be posed and solved as least-squares problems. Unfortunately, vanilla nonminimal solvers for least-squares problems are notoriously sensitive to outliers and initialization errors. The conventional approach to outlier rejection is to use a robust loss function, which is typically selected and tuned a priori. A newly developed approach to handle large initialization errors is graduated nonconvexity (GNC), which is defined for a particular choice of a robust loss function. The main contribution of this paper is to combine these two approaches by using an adaptive kernel within a GNC optimization scheme. This produces least-squares problems that are robust to both outliers and initialization errors, without the need for model selection and tuning. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust compared to non-GNC counterparts and performs on par with other GNC-tailored loss functions. An Example code can be found at https://github.com/decargroup/gnc-adapt.

### [Learning Direct Solutions in Moving Horizon Estimation with Deep Learning Methods]()

State estimation in the context of dynamical systems is crucial for various applications, including control and monitoring. Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is an optimization-based state estimation algorithm that leverages a known dynamical model integrated over a moving horizon. The MHE optimization criterion corresponds to identify the initial state that best aligns the integrated trajectory with the system observation. In MHE setting, the state estimation performance increases with the considered length of the moving horizon but it can become computationally intensive which is a limiting factor for its applicability to fast-varying dynamical systems or on hardware with restricted computational power. Deep Learning (DL) methods can learn solutions to complex optimization problems without incurring any additional online computational cost beyond the inference of the considered architecture. In the context of state estimation we propose to study different type of DL architecture in order to provide full state estimation from partial and noisy system observations. The novel proposed method is based on an end-to-end differentiable formulation of the MHE optimization problem, enabling the offline training of a DL model to provide a state estimation that minimizes the MHE optimization criterion. Once training is completed, state estimations are generated through an explicit relationship learned by the DL model. The proposed method is compared to the online MHE formulation in various case studies, including scenarios with partially observed state and model discrepancies in the context of lateral vehicle dynamics. The results highlight improved state estimation performance both in terms of reduced computational time and accuracy with respect to the online MHE algorithm.

### [A Data-Driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots]()

Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.

### [Simultaneous Ground Reaction Force and State Estimation Via Constrained Moving Horizon Estimation]()

Accurate ground reaction force (GRF) estimation can significantly improve the adaptability of legged robots in various real-world applications. For instance, with estimated GRF and contact kinematics, the locomotion control and planning assist the robot in overcoming uncertain terrains. The canonical momentum-based methods, formulated as nonlinear observers, do not fully address the noisy measurements and the dependence between floating-base states and the generalized momentum dynamics. In this paper, we present a simultaneous ground reaction force and state estimation framework for legged robots, which systematically addresses the sensor noise and the coupling between states and dynamics. With the floating base orientation estimated separately, a decentralized Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) method is implemented to fuse the robot dynamics, proprioceptive sensors, exteroceptive sensors, and deterministic contact complementarity constraints in a convex windowed optimization. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate GRF and state estimation on several legged robots, including the custom-designed humanoid robot Bucky, the open-source educational planar bipedal robot STRIDE, and the quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency of 200Hz and a past time window of 0.04s.

### [FracGM: A Fast Fractional Programming Technique for Geman-McClure Robust Estimator]()

Robust estimation is essential in computer vision, robotics, and navigation, aiming to minimize the impact of outlier measurements for improved accuracy. We present a fast algorithm for Geman-McClure robust estimation, FracGM, leveraging fractional programming techniques. This solver reformulates the original non-convex fractional problem to a convex dual problem and a linear equation system, iteratively solving them in an alternating optimization pattern. Compared to graduated non-convexity approaches, this strategy exhibits a faster convergence rate and better outlier rejection capability. In addition, the global optimality of the proposed solver can be guaranteed under given conditions. We demonstrate the proposed FracGM solver with Wahba's rotation problem and 3-D point-cloud registration along with relaxation pre-processing and projection post-processing. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, when the outlier rates increase from 20% to 80%, FracGM shows 53% and 88% lower rotation and translation increases. In real-world scenarios, FracGM achieves better results in 13 out of 18 outcomes, while having a 19.43% improvement in the computation time.

### [Equivariant IMU Preintegration with Biases: A Galilean Group Approach]()

This letter proposes a new approach for Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) preintegration, a fundamental building block that can be leveraged in different optimization-based Inertial Navigation System (INS) localization solutions. Inspired by recent advances in equivariant theory applied to biased INSs, we derive a discrete-time formulation of the IMU preintegration on Gal(3) ⋉ gal(3), the left-trivialization of the tangent group of the Galilean group Gal(3). We define a novel preintegration error that geometrically couples the navigation states and the bias leading to lower linearization error. Our method improves in consistency compared to existing preintegration approaches which treat IMU biases as a separate state-space. Extensive validation against state-of-the-art methods, both in simulation and with real-world IMU data, implementation in the Lie++ library, and open-source code are provided.

### [State Estimation for Continuum Multi-Robot Systems on SE(3)]()

In contrast to conventional robots, accurately modeling the kinematics and statics of continuum robots is challenging due to partially unknown material properties, parasitic effects, or unknown forces acting on the continuous body. Consequentially, state estimation approaches that utilize additional sensor information to predict the shape of continuum robots have garnered significant interest. This paper presents a novel approach to state estimation for systems with multiple coupled continuum robots, which allows estimating the shape and strain variables of multiple continuum robots in an arbitrary coupled topology. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the proposed method, while achieving accurate and continuous estimates for the state of such systems, resulting in average end-effector errors of 3.3 mm and 5.02° depending on the sensor setup. It is further shown, that the approach offers fast computation times of below 10 ms, enabling its utilization in quasi-static real-time scenarios with average update rates of 100-200 Hz. An open-source C++ implementation of the proposed state estimation method is made publicly available to the community.

### [IMU Augment Tightly Coupled Lidar-Visual-Inertial Odometry for Agricultural Environments]()

This paper presents a new tightly coupled LiDAR visual-odometry scheme for agricultural autonomous machinery under a structureless environment and the presence of fluctuation uncertainties. By proposing the robust adaptive filter, the effects of unknown disturbances and noises are significantly addressed. In the meantime, the IMU orientation is effectively estimated by the great capability of an error state Kalman filter (ESKF). The IMU attitude estimation is integrated to significantly improve the accuracy of both LiDAR and visual odometry. Hence, the suggested approach obtains the perfect output performance, smooth trajectory, and robustness against uncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed LiDAR visual-odometry is confirmed with the real-time experiment of different scenarios.

### [Joint 3D Point Cloud Segmentation Using Real-Sim Loop: From Panels to Trees and Branches]()

Modern orchards are planted in structured rows with distinct panel divisions to improve management. Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from P anel to T ree and B ranch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single-instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology, enabling the facilitation of field robotics across various domains.

### [Energy Efficient Planning for Repetitive Heterogeneous Tasks in Precision Agriculture]()

Robotic weed removal in precision agriculture introduces a repetitive heterogeneous task planning (RHTP) challenge for a mobile manipulator. RHTP has two unique characteristics: 1) an observe-first-and-manipulate-later (OFML) temporal constraint that forces a unique ordering of two different tasks for each target and 2) energy savings from efficient task collocation to minimize unnecessary movements. RHTP can be framed as a stochastic renewal process. According to the Renewal Reward Theorem, the expected energy usage per task cycle is the long-run average. Traditional task and motion planning focuses on feasibility rather than optimality due to the unknown object and obstacle position prior to execution. However, the known target/obstacle distribution in precision agriculture allows minimizing the expected energy usage. For each instance in this renewal process, we first compute task space partition, a novel data structure that computes all possibilities of task multiplexing and its probabilities with robot reachability. Then we propose a region-based set-coverage problem to formulate the RHTP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming. We have implemented and solved RHTP using Branch-and-Bound solver. Compared to a baseline in simulations based on real field data, the results suggest a significant improvement in path length, number of robot stops, overall energy usage, and number of replans.

### [Leveraging LLMs for Mission Planning in Precision Agriculture]()

Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that	leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

### [Hierarchical Tri-Manual Planning for Vision-Assisted Fruit Harvesting with Quadrupedal Robots]()

This paper addresses the challenge of developing a multi-arm quadrupedal robot capable of efficiently harvesting fruit in complex, natural environments. To overcome the inherent limitations of traditional bimanual manipulation, we introduce the first three-arm quadrupedal robot LocoHarv-3, that builds on top of the Spot quadruped, and propose a novel hierarchical tri-manual planning approach for automated fruit harvesting with collision-free trajectories between the built-in end-effector of Spot and our custom-made bimanual manipulator. Our comprehensive semi-autonomous framework integrates teleoperation, supported by LiDAR-based odometry and mapping, with learning-based visual perception for accurate fruit detection and pose estimation. Validation is conducted through a series of controlled indoor experiments using motion capture and extensive field tests in natural settings. Results demonstrate a 90% success rate in in-lab settings with a single attempt, and field trials further verify the system's robustness and efficiency in more challenging real-world environments.

### [Capacitated Agriculture Fleet Vehicle Routing with Implements and Limited Autonomy: A Model and a Two-Phase Solution Approach]()

In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for a fleet of cooperative autonomous agricultural robots (agribots) equipped with detachable implements, with the goal of efficiently and sustainably completing agricultural tasks in precision crop farming. State of the art in the area of agribot fleet routing with detachable implements is lacking. Consequently, we propose the Capacitated Agriculture Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Implements and Limited Autonomy (CAFVRPILA), designed to optimize the agribot fleet's routes across a set of given agricultural tasks while considering implement capacities, agribot-implement compatibilities, and agribots' limited battery autonomies. A heuristic two-phase decomposition approach is proposed for this problem. Simulation experiments show that minimizing travel distances and costs with CAFVRPILA enhances sustainable farming while maximizing productivity and resource use. The results also demonstrate that synchronizing multiple operations improves efficiency, particularly in larger fleets.

### [Towards Closing the Loop in Robotic Pollination for Indoor Farming Via Autonomous Microscopic Inspection]()

Effective pollination is a key challenge for indoor farming, since bees struggle to navigate without the sun. While a variety of robotic system solutions have been proposed, it remains difficult to autonomously check that a flower has been sufficiently pollinated to produce high-quality fruit, which is especially critical for self-pollinating crops such as strawberries. To this end, this work proposes a novel robotic system for indoor farming. The proposed hardware combines a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator arm with a custom end-effector, comprised of an endoscope camera, a 2-DOF microscope subsystem, and a custom vibrating pollination tool; this is paired with algorithms to detect and estimate the pose of strawberry flowers, navigate to each flower, pollinate using the tool, and inspect with the microscope. The key novelty is vibrating the flower from below while simultaneously inspecting with a microscope from above. Each subsystem is validated via extensive experiments.

### [Embedded Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control Using Sensitivity Tubes and GPU Acceleration]()

This paper proposes a method to robustify model predictive path integral (MPPI) control by directly taking into account the effects of parameter uncertainty into the controller formulation. Leveraging the recent notion of closed-loop state sensitivity, the proposed MPPI can consider the state sensitivity against parameter mismatch as a part of the system state, and consequently exploit this additional information to address the challenge of model mismatch in sampling-based model predictive control. Using an obstacle avoidance scenario, we demonstrate the use of our approach to control an aerial robot. We present an embedded implementation of our method, utilizing parallelization of computations on a GPU. Finally, we show the increased robustness of our approach over a standard MPPI controller through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and validate its embedded real-time properties.

### [Guided Bayesian Optimization: Data-Efficient Controller Tuning with Digital Twin (I)]()

This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using a digital twin of the system. The digital twin is built using closed-loop data acquired during standard BO iterations, and activated when the uncertainty in the Gaussian Process model of the optimization objective on the real system is high. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by our data-driven criteria related to the digital twin's uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters.

We present a novel differentiable approach to quantifying and optimizing stability in robotic systems addressing an open challenge in the field of robot analysis, control,design, and optimization. Our method leverages differentiable simulation over extended time horizons to estimate a robustness metric based on the Lyapunov exponents. The proposed metric offers several properties, including a natural extension to limit cycles (commonly encountered in robotics tasks and locomotion)and independence from the trajectory path for states converging to the attractor. We showcase, with an textit{ad-hoc} JAX gradient-based optimization framework, remarkable flexibility in tackling the robustness challenge. Our approach is tested through diverse scenarios of varying complexity, encompassing high-degree-of-freedom systems and contact-rich environments. The positive outcomes across these cases highlight the potential of our method in quantifying and possibly enhancing system robustness.

### [Second-Order Stein Variational Dynamic Optimization]()

We present a novel second-order trajectory optimization algorithm based on Stein Variational Newton's Method and Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming. The proposed algorithm, called Stein Variational Differential Dynamic Programming, is a kernel-based extension of Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming that combines the best of the two worlds of sampling-based and gradient-based optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids known drawbacks of gradient-based dynamic optimization in terms of getting stuck at local minima, while it overcomes limitations of sampling-based stochastic optimization in terms of introducing undesirable stochasticity when applied in online fashion. To test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, experiments are conducted in Model Predictive Control mode. The experiments include comparisons with unimodal and multimodal Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming as well as Model Predictive Path Integral Control and its multimodal and Stein Variational extensions. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms and confirm the hypothesis that there is a middle ground between sampling- and gradient-based optimization that is indeed beneficial for dynamic optimization.

### [Application of Koopman Direct Encoding-Based Model Predictive Control to Nonlinear Electromechanical Systems]()

The Koopman operator framework has shown promising results in enabling the analysis of nonlinear dynamics into an infinite-dimensional linear representation. Koopman direct encoding (KDE) is a model-based approach that utilizes inner products and compositions in a Hilbert space to compute the Koopman operator. However, it has primarily been applied to autonomous systems and simulation environments. Here, we extend the application of KDE to nonautonomous systems and real-world environments by introducing Koopman direct encoding-based model predictive control (KDE-MPC). It was validated on nonlinear electromechanical systems with segmented dynamic conditions, such as contact-noncontact transitions, which pose challenges for modeling and control. Simulation results demonstrate a more stable and smoother position profile compared to proportional-integral-derivative control, particularly at discontinuous boundaries. KDE-MPC was also applied to real-world systems, achieving similar position tracking performance to simulation results. We anticipate that KDE-MPC will offer a viable solution for complex robotic control challenges.

### [Effective Search for Control Hierarchies within the Policy Decomposition Framework]()

Policy decomposition is a novel framework for approximating optimal control policies of complex dynamical systems with a hierarchy of policies derived from smaller but tractable subsystems. It stands out amongst the class of hierarchical control methods by estimating a priori how well the closed-loop behavior of different control hierarchies matches the optimal policy. However, the number of possible hierarchies grows prohibitively with the number of inputs and the dimension of the state-space of the system making it unrealistic to estimate the closed-loop performance for all hierarchies. Here, we present the development of two search methods based on Genetic Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Tree Search to tackle this combinatorial challenge, and demonstrate that it is indeed surmountable. We showcase the efficacy of our search methods and the generality of the framework by applying it towards finding hierarchies for control of three distinct robotic systems: a simplified biped, a planar manipulator, anda quadcopter. The discovered hierarchies, in comparison to heuristically designed ones, provide improved closed-loop performance or can be computed in minimal time with marginally worse control performance, and also exceed the control performance of policies obtained with popular deep reinforcement learning methods.

### [Movement Primitive Diffusion: Learning Gentle Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Objects]()

Policy learning in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) lacks data efficient and versatile methods that exhibit the desired motion quality for delicate surgical interventions. To this end, we introduce Movement Primitive Diffusion (MPD), a novel method for imitation learning (IL) in RAS that focuses on gentle manipulation of deformable objects. The approach combines the versatility of diffusion-based imitation learning (DIL) with the high-quality motion generation capabilities of Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). This combination enables MPD to achieve gentle manipulation of deformable objects, while maintaining data efficiency critical for RAS applications where demonstration data is scarce. We evaluate MPD across various simulated and real world robotic tasks on both state and image observations. MPD outperforms state-of-the-art DIL methods in success rate, motion quality, and data efficiency.

### [Sim-Grasp: Learning 6-DOF Grasp Policies for Cluttered Environments Using a Synthetic Benchmark]()

In this paper, we present Sim-Grasp, a robust 6-DOF two-finger grasping system that integrates advanced language models for enhanced object manipulation in cluttered environments. We introduce the Sim-Grasp-Dataset, which includes 1,550 objects across 500 scenarios with 7.9 million annotated labels, and develop Sim-GraspNet to generate grasp poses from point clouds. The Sim-Grasp-Polices achieve grasping success rates of 97.14% for single objects and 87.43% and 83.33% for mixed clutter scenarios of Levels 1-2 and Levels 3-4 objects, respectively. By incorporating language models for target identification through text and box prompts, Sim-Grasp enables both object-agnostic and target picking, pushing the boundaries of intelligent robotic systems.

### [Controlled Robot Language with Frame Semantics (FrameCRL) for Autonomous Context-Aware High-Level Planning]()

This paper proposes a configurable and scalable framework based on Controlled Robot Language with Frame Semantics (FrameCRL) for plan generation. Given natural language instructions, FrameCRL constructs an equivalent formal semantic formulation in the form of discourse representation structures (DRS). Imperative verbs are extracted from the semantic structures as keys to anchor relevant semantic frames from FrameNet, and the selected semantic frames are used to construct goal statements in planning language. Non-imperative statements are further analyzed to generate object specifications and the initial state of the planning problem. These generated statements are then merged into a single planning script, which can be solved directly by the integrated planner. The performance of FrameCRL was evaluated on various natural language corpora and compared with large language models (LLM) based methods in plan generation. The results demonstrated the outperformance of FrameCRL in generating high-quality plans and its capability to handle large context scenarios. The FrameCRL was also tested on pick-and-place tasks using a dual-arm robot and it showcased a robust performance in linguistic understanding.

### [Effective Tuning Strategies for Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies]()

Generalist robot manipulation policies (GMPs) have the potential to generalize across a wide range of tasks, environments, and devices. However, existing policies continue to struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios, considering that the action data remains notoriously hard to collect. While fine-tuning offers a practical way to quickly adapt a GMP to novel domains and tasks with limited samples, we observe that the performance of the resulting GMP differs significantly with respect to the design choices of fine-tuning strategies. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth empirical study to investigate the effect of key factors in GMP fine-tuning strategies, covering the action space, policy head, and the choice of tunable parameters, where over 2,500 rollouts are evaluated for a single configuration. We systematically discuss and summarize our findings and identify the key design choices, which we believe give a practical guideline for GMP fine-tuning. We observe that in a low-data regime, with carefully chosen fine-tuning strategies, a GMP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms. The results presented in this work establish a new baseline for future studies on fine-tuned GMPs.

### [RM-Planner: Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Whole-Body Model Predictive Control for Mobile Manipulation]()

Mobile manipulation is a crucial problem in various real-world applications. However, existing methods have demonstrated unsatisfactory training efficiency and sparse rewards, requiring complex coordination strategies between the mobile base and arm. In this paper, we propose RM-Planner, a planning method for mobile manipulation tasks in unknown complex environments. By adopting a two-layer hierarchical framework, we utilize a whole-body Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based low-level planner to track subgoals and generate aggressive but safe joint commands throughout the entire manipulation process, while a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based high-level policy directly uses 3D point cloud representations of the environment, guiding the robot to achieve optimal manipulation postures based on current observations and specific task objectives. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments, where RM-planner significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released at href{https://github.com/SYSU-RoboticsLab/RM-Planner.git}{h ttps://github.com/SYSU-RoboticsLab/RM-Planner.git}.

### [Routing Manipulation of Deformable Linear Object Using Reinforcement Learning and Diffusion Policy]()

Tasks involving deformable linear objects (DLOs) are prevalent in daily life but pose significant challenges due to their infinite degrees of freedom and underactuated nature. Frequent contact between DLOs and surrounding objects with unknown physical parameters, such as friction, further complicates their manipulation. Performing tasks like routing ropes through a hole requires gentle yet robust manipulation, making it particularly challenging. Previous research has not adequately addressed general DLO manipulation tasks that involve intensive contact, especially in environments with rough surfaces. This paper presents a robust and delicate manipulation learning approach for the DLO routing task, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and diffusion policy. First, reinforcement learning agents are trained separately for rope insertion and pulling. During training, the agents are encouraged to minimize rope tension throughout task execution in environments with randomized friction to achieve delicate motion. Next, the rollouts from these agents are collected as expert demonstrations to train a diffusion policy. Our approach generates delicate motions to prevent the rope from being damaged or getting stuck on rough surfaces while remaining robust against environmental disturbances.

### [TransDiff: Diffusion-Based Method for Manipulating Transparent Objects Using a Single RGB-D Image]()

Manipulating transparent objects presents significant challenges due to the complexities introduced by their reflection and refraction properties, which considerably hinder the accurate estimation of their 3D shapes. To address these challenges, we, for the first time, propose a single-view RGB-D-based depth completion framework, TransDiff, that leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPM) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in desktop. Specifically, we leverage features extracted from RGB images, including semantic segmentation, edge maps, and normal maps, to condition the depth map generation process. Our method learns an iterative denoising process that transforms a random depth distribution into a depth map, guided by initially refined depth information, ensuring more accurate depth estimation in scenarios involving transparent objects. Additionally, we propose a novel training method to better align the noisy depth and RGB image features, which are used as conditions to refine depth estimation step by step. Finally, we utilized an improved inference process to accelerate the denoising procedure. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with acceptable inference time. The demo of our method can be found on: url{https://transdiff.github.io/}

### [Efficient Submap-Based Autonomous MAV Exploration Using Visual-Inertial SLAM Configurable for LiDARs or Depth Cameras]()

Autonomous exploration of unknown space is an essential component for the deployment of mobile robots in the real world. Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

### [Parking-SG: Open-Vocabulary Hierarchical 3D Scene Graph Representation for Open Parking Environments]()

Automatic Valet Parking (AVP) has garnered significant attention from industry and academia due to its potential to enhance traffic efficiency, parking safety, and user experience. While AVP technologies have been successfully applied in standard parking scenarios with clear markings, real-world parking environments are far more diverse and complex, posing challenges for current systems. To address these limitations, we present Parking-SG, an open-vocabulary hierarchical 3D scene graph representation, facilitating the application of AVP in open and complex environments. Our approach builds an object-based, open-vocabulary map that integrates both ground-level and ground-above objects for comprehensive environmental understanding. Leveraging common sense reasoning and object behavior relationships, various standard or non-standard parking spaces are inferred in open environments. Additionally, we extract and analyze path topology to construct a hierarchical map representation, supporting complex AVP tasks. Parking-SG is validated in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating its ability to generate rich environmental representations, accurately and flexibly infer parking spaces, and effectively perform complex AVP tasks.

### [3D Lane Detection Based on Projection-Consistent Reference Points and Intra & Inter-Lane Context]()

3D lane detection aims to identify lane categories and trends in 3D space, which is a vital and challenging task in autonomous driving. Existing methods introduce various priors to guide 3D lane prediction, which generally consist of a series of reference points for context aggregation. However, due to the misalignment between these reference points and the lanes, it is difficult to obtain complete and discriminative context for complex instances. In this paper, we are devoted to introducing 3D priors adaptive to lane appearances, which serve as references to aggregate the lane context. Specifically, we propose a projection-consistent reference generation strategy to keep the projected 3D reference points geometrically consistent with the corresponding lanes in images. In addition, a segmentation-lifting denoising strategy is designed to improve the ability of the model to map the lane segmentation into 3D space. To leverage more lane-related information, we propose a decoupled lane-context aggregation module by considering the perspectives of individual geometries and integrated layout, namely intra-lane and inter-lane context. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane dataset show that our approach outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code will be made publicly available.

### [Unveiling the Black Box: Independent Functional Module Evaluation for Bird's-Eye-View Perception Model]()

End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving perception. However, the inability to meticulously deconstruct their internal mechanisms results in diminished development efficacy and impedes the establishment of trust. Pioneering in the issue, we present the Independent Functional Module Evaluation for Bird’s-Eye-View Perception Model (BEV-IFME), a novel framework that juxtaposes the module's feature maps against Ground Truth within a unified semantic Representation Space to quantify their similarity, thereby assessing the training maturity of individual functional modules. The core of the framework lies in the process of feature map encoding and representation aligning, facilitated by our proposed two-stage Alignment AutoEncoder, which ensures the preservation of salient information and the consistency of feature structure. The metric for evaluating the training maturity of functional modules, Similarity Score, demonstrates a robust positive correlation with BEV metrics, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9387, attesting to the framework's reliability for assessment purposes.

### [Panoptic-Depth Forecasting]()

Forecasting the semantics and 3D structure of scenes is essential for robots to navigate and plan actions safely. Recent methods have explored semantic and panoptic scene forecasting; however, they do not consider the geometry of the scene. In this work, we propose the panoptic-depth forecasting task for jointly predicting future panoptic segmentation and depth maps from monocular camera images. To facilitate this work, we extend the popular KITTI-360 and Cityscapes benchmarks by computing depth maps from LiDAR point clouds and leveraging sequential labeled data. We also introduce a suitable evaluation metric that quantifies both the panoptic quality and depth estimation accuracy of future frames in a coherent manner. Furthermore, we present two baselines and propose the novel netname architecture that learns rich spatio-temporal representations by incorporating a transformer-based encoder, a forecasting module, and task-specific decoders to predict future panoptic-depth outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of netname across two datasets and three forecasting tasks, consistently addressing the primary challenges. We make the code publicly available at https://pdcast.cs.uni-freiburg.de

### [Coarse-To-Fine Cross-Modality Generation for Enhancing Vehicle Re-Identification with High-Fidelity Synthetic Data]()

Due to the critical issues of privacy and partial occlusion, license plate information is not always available in vehicle recognition systems. Consequently, researchers have increasingly turned towards vehicle re-identification (reID) techniques to bridge the gap between cross-view camera systems. Despite the growing interest, one major challenge persists: the scarcity of authentic, large-scale training datasets. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline designed to synthesize high-fidelity vehicle data, thereby facilitating subsequent vehicle representation learning. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of three stages: Prompt Processing, Diffusion Fine-tuning, and Semantic Filtering. First, we collect detailed prompts from vehicle websites and companies with fine-grained vehicle prototype attributes. Next, we leverage the prior knowledge of these automotive prototypes to fine-tune diffusion models. Finally, to ensure the quality of the synthesized data, we employ pre-trained vision-language models to filter out substandard images. Building upon the high-quality data generated by this pipeline, we validate the effectiveness using vanilla models. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy on public benchmarks such as VeRi-776, VehicleID and CityFlowV2, and is compatible with various model architectures.

### [HGS-Mapping: Online Dense Mapping Using Hybrid Gaussian Representation in Urban Scenes]()

Online dense mapping of urban scenes forms a fundamental cornerstone for scene understanding and naviga- tion of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements in dense mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still facestwo challenges, including incom- plete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To thisend, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first tointegrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstructionspeed.

### [Distributed Multi-Robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources]()

We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.

### [Deploying Ten Thousand Robots: Scalable Imitation Learning for Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding]()

Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (LMAPF) repeatedly finds collision-free paths for multiple agents that are continually assigned new goals when they reach current ones. Recently, this field has embraced learning-based methods, which reactively generate single-step actions based on individual local observations. However, it is still challenging for them to match the performance of the best search-based algorithms, especially in large-scale settings. This work proposes an imitation-learning-based LMAPF solver that introduces a novel communication module as well as systematic single-step collision resolution and global guidance techniques. Our proposed solver, Scalable Imitation Learning for LMAPF (SILLM), inherits the fast reasoning speed of learning-based methods and the high solution quality of search-based methods with the help of modern GPUs. Across six large-scale maps with up to 10,000 agents and varying obstacle structures, SILLM surpasses the best learning- and search-based baselines, achieving average throughput improvements of 137.7% and 16.0%, respectively. Furthermore, SILLM also beats the winning solution of the 2023 League of Robot Runners, an international LMAPF competition. Finally, we validated SILLM with 10 real robots and 100 virtual robots in a mock warehouse environment.

### [Multi-Nonholonomic Robot Object Transportation with Obstacle Crossing Using a Deformable Sheet]()

In this paper, we address multi-robot formation planning where nonholonomic robots collaboratively transport objects using a deformable sheet in unstructured, cluttered environments. The formation can expand or contract to adjust the height of the object on the sheet. However, interactions between the robots and sheet introduce complex constraints for formation planning. Complexity increases further when the only feasible solution requires crossing an obstacle, i.e. where robots navigate in different homotopy classes around an obstacle such that the object hovers above it. Most existing nonholonomic formation planners do not admit obstacle crossing, limiting performance. In this paper, we present a two-stage iterative trajectory optimization framework which explicitly considers obstacle crossing. First, we capture the set of all feasible homotopy classes for each robot using a topological probabilistic roadmap. We then iteratively apply numerical optimization techniques to find a safe and feasible solution for the formation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in simulation and on real robot hardware.

### [Configuration-Adaptive Visual Relative Localization for Spherical Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robots]()

Spherical Modular Self-reconfigurable Robots (SMSRs) have been popular in recent years. Their Self-reconfigurable nature allows them to adapt to different environments and tasks, and achieve what a single module could not achieve. To collaborate with each other, relative localization between each module and assembly is crucial. Existing relative localization methods either have low accuracy, which is unsuitable for short-distance collaborations, or are designed for fixed-shape robots, whose visual features remain static over time. This paper proposes the first visual relative localization method for SMSRs. We first detect and identify individual modules of SMSRs, and adopt visual tracking to improve the detection and identification robustness. Using an optimization-based method, tracking result is then fused with odometry to estimate the relative pose between assemblies. To deal with the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we adopt semi-definite relaxation to transform it into a convex form. The proposed method is validated and analysed in real-world experiments. The overall localization performance and the performance under time-varying configuration are evaluated. The result shows that the relative position estimation accuracy reaches 2%, and the orientation estimation accuracy reaches 6.64^circ, and that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.

### [Realm: Real-Time Line-Of-Sight Maintenance in Multi-Robot Navigation with Unknown Obstacles]()

Multi-robot navigation in complex environments relies on inter-robot communication and mutual observation for situational awareness. This paper studies the multi-robot navigation problem in unknown environments with line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity constraints. While previous works are limited to known environment models to derive the LoS constraints between robots, this paper eliminates such requirements by directly formulating the LoS constraints from real-time LiDAR scans, adopting techniques in point cloud visibility analysis. Based on that, we propose a novel LoS-distance metric to quantify both the urgency and sensitivity of losing LoS between robots considering their potential movements. Moreover, to address the imbalanced urgency of losing LoS between two robots, we design a fusion function to capture the overall urgency while generating gradients that facilitate robots' collaborative behavior to maintain LoS. The team connectivity is guaranteed by encoding the LoS constraints into a potential function that preserves the positivity of the Fiedler eigenvalue of robots' underlying graph. Finally, we establish a LoS-constrained exploration framework integrating the proposed connectivity controller. We showcase its applications in multi-robot exploration in complex unknown environments, where robots can always maintain the LoS connectivity through distributed sensing and communication while collaboratively exploring unknown environments. Our implementations are available at url{https://github.com/bairuofei/LoS_constrained_navigation}.

### [Personalizing Interfaces to Humans with User-Friendly Priors]()

Robots often need to convey information to human users. For example, robots can leverage visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces to display their intent or express their internal state. In some scenarios there are socially agreed upon conventions for what these signals mean: e.g., a red light indicates an autonomous car is slowing down. But as robots develop new capabilities and seek to convey more complex data, the meaning behind their signals is not always mutually understood: one user might think a flashing light indicates the autonomous car is an aggressive driver, while another user might think the same signal means the autonomous car is defensive. In this paper we enable robots to adapt their interfaces to the current user so that the human's personalized interpretation is aligned with the robot's meaning. We start with an information theoretic end-to-end approach, which automatically tunes the interface policy to optimize the correlation between human and robot. But to ensure that this learning policy is intuitive --- and to accelerate how quickly the interface adapts to the human --- we recognize that humans have priors over how interfaces should function. For instance, humans expect interface signals to be proportional and convex. Our approach biases the robot's interface towards these priors, resulting in signals that are adapted to the current user while still following social expectations. Our simulations and user study results across 15 participants suggest that these priors improve robot-to-human communication. See videos here: https://youtu.be/Re3OLg57hp8.

### [Personalization in Human-Robot Interaction through Preference-Based Action Representation Learning]()

Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has shown significant promise for personalization in human-robot interaction (HRI) by explicitly integrating human preferences into the robot learning process. However, existing practices often require training a personalized robot policy from scratch, resulting in inefficient use of human feedback. In this paper, we propose preference-based action representation learning (PbARL), an efficient fine-tuning method that decouples common task structure from preference by leveraging pre-trained robot policies. Instead of directly fine-tuning the pre-trained policy with human preference, PbARL uses it as a reference for an action representation learning task that maximizes the mutual information between the pre-trained source domain and the target user preference-aligned domain. This approach allows the robot to personalize its behaviors while preserving original task performance and eliminates the need for extensive prior information from the source domain, thereby enhancing efficiency and practicality in real-world HRI scenarios. Empirical results on the Assistive Gym benchmark and a real-world user study (N=8) demonstrate the benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [Interface Matters: Comparing First and Third-Person Perspective Interfaces for Bi-Manual Robot Behavioural Cloning]()

Despite the growing interest in Behavioural Cloning for robots, few existing research has explicitly explored the impact of user interfaces on the effectiveness of expert demonstrations. We investigate the importance of user interface design in Behavioural Cloning, highlighting the critical role that interfaces play in conveying human demonstrations and robotics capabilities. This study compares the effectiveness of first and third-person perspective interfaces for robot shoe- lacing, a highly dexterous, bi-manual manipulation task that involves deformable objects and requires high precision. Our study highlights the importance of considering the impact of interface design on expert demonstration quality in Behavioural Cloning applications. By providing a first-person perspective, we observed significant differences in demonstration execution time and consistency compared to the third-person perspective. These findings suggest that the choice of interface can influence the quality of expert demonstrations, which in turn affects the performance of learning algorithms.

### [Robot Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations: An Active Reinforcement Learning Approach]()

Transfer Learning (TL) is a powerful tool that enables robots to transfer learned policies across different environments, tasks, or embodiments. To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.

### [User-Aware Collaborative Learning in Human-Robot Interactions]()

Our work investigates how social robots can efficiently collaborate with human users in a user-aware manner, minimising the generated frustration in human colleagues, thus enhancing their experience. As part of this, we develop a user-aware framework for human-robot collaborative learning. We model users’ frustration during human-robot interactions based on recent interactions inspired by Psychological principles and develop different frustration-aware interactive preference learning and decision-making models using multi-armed bandit and knapsack methods. Evaluating our approach, 1) we conducted simulated experiments on realistic human-behaviour datasets and 2) a user-study in which participants worked with a TIAGo Steel humanoid robot on a collaboration task using frustration-aware and non frustration-aware (Upper Confidence Bounds and Instruction-based) models. We demonstrate that when collaborating with the frustration-aware robot, users completed the collaboration task 9.04% faster and using 20.54% less number of verbal interactions, with user questionnaire responses reporting less frustration experienced compared to the baseline approaches. Additionally, we create a multimodal dataset containing over 6 hours of human-robot interactions displaying various explicit and implicit user responses.

### [Data-Efficient Learning from Human Interventions for Mobile Robots]()

Mobile robots are essential in applications such as autonomous delivery and hospitality services. Applying learning-based methods to address mobile robot tasks has gained popularity due to its robustness and generalizability. Traditional methods such as Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer adaptability but require large datasets, carefully crafted reward functions, and face sim-to-real gaps, making them challenging for efficient and safe real-world deployment. We propose an online human-in-the-loop learning method PVP4Real that combines IL and RL to address these issues. PVP4Real enables efficient real-time policy learning from online human intervention and demonstration, without reward or any pretraining, significantly improving data efficiency and training safety. We validate our method by training two different robots---a legged quadruped, and a wheeled delivery robot---in two mobile robot tasks, one of which even uses raw RGBD image as observation. The training finishes {within 15 minutes}. Our experiments show the promising future of human-in-the-loop learning in addressing the data efficiency issue in real-world robotic tasks.

### [A Morphing Quadrotor-Blimp with Balloon Failure Resilience for Mobile Ecological Sensing]()

The increasing popularity of helium-assisted blimps for extended monitoring or data collection applications is hindered by a critical limitation -- single-point failure when the balloon malfunctions or bursts. To address this, we introduce Janus, a hybrid blimp-drone platform equipped with integrated balloon failure detection and recovery capability. Janus employs a triggered mechanism that seamlessly transitions the platform from a blimp to a standard quad-rotor drone. Utilizing multiple sensors and fusing their readings, we have developed a robust balloon failure detection system. Janus demonstrates omnidirectional mobility in blimp mode and transitions promptly into quadrotor mode upon receiving the signal. Our results affirm the successful recovery of the system from balloon failure, with a rapid response time of 66ms to balloon failure detection. The drone morphs into a quadrotor and achieves recovery within 0.362 seconds in 90% of cases. By amalgamating the enduring flight capabilities of blimps with the agility of quad-rotors within a morphing platform like Janus, we cater to applications demanding both prolonged flight duration and enhanced agility.

### [A Novel Passive Parallel Elastic Actuation Principle for Load Compensation in Legged Robots]()

This work introduces a novel parallel elastic actuation principle designed to provide torque compensation for legged robots. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed concept leverages a nitrogen N2 gas spring combined with a cam roller module to generate a highly customizable torque compensation profile for the target leg joint. An optimization-based design approach is employed to derive the specifications of the gas spring and optimize the cam module to produce a compensation torque profile closest to the desired one. The proposed load compensation concept and related mechanism are experimentally evaluated and practically integrated into the knee joint of a two-DoF monopedal robot actuated by cycloid actuators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed principle can effectively generate the required compensation torque profile and achieve significant benefits for the prototyped monopedal robot system by reducing 71.92% of the additional energy consumption caused by the payload. The entire system is compact, easy to integrate, and highly customizable, enabling the creation of nonlinear torque compensation profiles as needed. The work provides a promising solution to load compensation in legged robots.

### [Mathematical Modeling and Rolling Motion Generation of Planar Seven-Link Robot That Forms Passive Closed and Active Open Chains]()

This paper investigates the mathematical modeling and basic motion properties of planar seven-link robots that forms passive closed and active open chains. The passive closed model is formed by connecting seven rigid frames via seven viscoelastic joints, and the active open model is formed by connecting them via actuated joints. The former is a convex heptagonal model and can exhibit passive-dynamic rolling on a gentle downhill, whereas the latter virtually forms a forward-leaning octagonal shape by controlling the six relative joint angles. In the first half of this paper, we describe the model assumptions and develop the mathematical equations of motion and collision of the passive closed model, and numerically analyze the motion characteristics by changing the slope angle while checking the conditions necessary for stable motion generation. In the second half, we outline the active open model, develop the PD control system, and numerically analyze the motion characteristics by changing the target angle parameter that controls the degree of forward lean of the virtual octagon.

### [Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control Using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions]()

We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.

### [Poloidal Drive: Direct-Drive Transmission Mechanism for Active Omni-Wheels with Spoke Interference Avoidance]()

Wheels require extra space for steering. Omnidirectional wheels are ideal for confined spaces as they can move in all directions: forward/backward and left/right. Conventional omnidirectional wheels with passive rollers achieve this movement by combining multiple wheels. However, if even one wheel loses contact with the ground, the vehicle becomes inoperable. To overcome this limitation, omnidirectional wheels with actively driven rollers have been proposed. These designs, however, require additional components, which increase weight. This is because multi-step intermediate transmission mechanisms are needed to convert spindle rotation into roller rotation. Eliminating the intermediate transmission mechanism reduces the number of components and provides more space to enhance wheel strength. This study proposed a mechanism without intermediate transmission, clarified its design framework, and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility as an active omnidirectional wheel. The proposed design framework defines conditions to maximize both power transmission efficiency and strength. Experimental results showed that the transmission efficiency of the proposed mechanism is comparable to that of conventional mechanisms.

### [An End-To-End Learning-Based Multi-Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Vehicle Localization]()

Multi-sensor fusion is essential for autonomous vehicle localization, as it is capable of integrating data from various sources for enhanced accuracy and reliability. The accuracy of the integrated location and orientation depends on the precision of the uncertainty modeling. Traditional methods of uncertainty modeling typically assume a Gaussian distribution and involve manual heuristic parameter tuning. However, these methods struggle to scale effectively and address long-tail scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based method that encodes sensor information using higher-order neural network features, thereby eliminating the need for uncertainty estimation. This method significantly eliminates the need for parameter fine-tuning by developing an end-to-end neural network that is specifically designed for multi-sensor fusion. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing multi-sensor fusion methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. A video of the results can be viewed at https://youtu.be/q4iuobMbjME.

### [Unleashing HyDRa: Hybrid Fusion, Depth Consistency and Radar for Unified 3D Perception]()

Low-cost, vision-centric 3D perception systems for autonomous driving have made significant progress in recent years, narrowing the gap to expensive LiDAR-based methods. The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a adar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new semantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted into a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based methods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU. Code and models are available at https://github.com/phi-wol/hydra.

### [VIP-Dock: Vision, Inertia, and Pressure Sensor Fusion for Underwater Docking with Optical Beacon Guidance]()

Underwater docking enhances the operational capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) by facilitating energy and data transfer. Optical beacons serve as the primary guidance method for AUVs to localize and track docking stations. This paper presents VIP-Dock, a novel optical beacon tracking algorithm for robust underwater docking of AUVs. VIP-Dock addresses the challenge of maintaining accurate beacon tracking under visual interference by integrating visual, inertial, and pressure perception. Employing an unscented Kalman filter framework, the VIP-Dock algorithm provides continuous optimal estimation of beacon positions. Experimental results demonstrated VIP-Dock's real-time tracking performance in actual docking scenarios and its ability to maintain accuracy during visual input failure. Implementation in a digital twin system for an underwater vertical shuttle showed significant improvement, increasing docking success rates from 62% to 84% across 100 trials under simulated current disturbances.

### [Heterogeneous Sensor Fusion and Active Perception for Transparent Object Reconstruction with a PDM^2 Sensor and a Camera]()

Transparent household objects present a challenge for domestic service robots, since neither regular cameras nor RGB-D cameras can provide accurate points for shape reconstruction. The new type of pretouch dual-modality distance and material sensor (PDM^2) can provide reliable and accurate depth readings, but it is a point sensor and scanning the object exclusively with the sensor is too inefficient. Hence, we present a sensor fusion approach by combining a regular camera with the PDM^2 sensor. The approach is based on a data fusion algorithm for shape reconstruction and an active perception algorithm for scan planning for the PDM^2 sensor. The data fusion algorithm is a distributed Gaussian process (GP)-based shape reconstruction method that allows for incremental local update to reduce computational time. The active perception algorithm is an optimization-based approach by increasing the information gain (IG) and prioritizing the boundary points under a preset travel distance constraint. We have implemented and tested the algorithms with six different transparent household items. The results show satisfactory shape reconstruction results in all test cases with an average increase in intersection over union (IoU) from 0.73 to 0.96.

### [DA-Fusion: Deformable Attention-Based RGB-D Fusion Transformer for Unseen Object Instance Segmentation]()

In logistics automation, accurately segmenting unseen objects is essential for tasks such as bin picking, shelf picking, and warehouse sorting, which involve complex and cluttered environments. Traditional RGB-based methods tend to over-segment objects due to their reliance on texture, while depth-based methods often under-segment by focusing primarily on geometric features. To address these limitations, we propose DA-Fusion, a deformable attention-based RGB-D fusion Transformer designed for unseen object instance segmentation. DA-Fusion effectively combines the strengths of both RGB and depth data, enhancing segmentation accuracy in cluttered and multi-layered object environments. We also introduce the Object Clutter Bin Dataset (OCBD), a benchmark dataset specifically tailored for evaluating bin-picking scenarios in top-down views. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DA-Fusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments, making it particularly suited for real-world logistics tasks.

### [PAIR360: A Paired Dataset of High-Resolution 360˚ Panoramic Images and LiDAR Scans]()

The 360˚ camera is a compact omnidirectional perception system for capturing panoramic images with the same field of view as LiDAR. This boosts its versatility for use in autonomous driving and robotics. However, most existing datasets of 360˚ panoramic images primarily focus on indoor or virtual environments, or they offer only low-resolution outdoor images and LiDAR configurations. In this letter, we present PAIR360, a multi-modal dataset encompassing high-resolution 360˚ camera images and 3D LiDAR scans, aimed at stimulating research in computer vision. To this end, we collected a comprehensive dataset at Kyung Hee University Global Campus, capturing 52 sequences from 7 different areas under diverse atmospheric conditions, including sunny, cloudy, and sunrise. The dataset features 8K resolution panoramic imagery, six	fisheye images, point clouds, GPS, and IMU data, all synchronized using LiDAR timestamps and calibrated across visual sensors. We also provide additional data, such as depth maps, segmentation, and 3D maps, to demonstrate the feasibility of our dataset and its application to various computer vision tasks. The dataset is available for download at: https://airlabkhu.github.io/PAIR-360-Dataset/

### [NDOB-Based Control of a UAV with Delta-Arm Considering Manipulator Dynamics]()

Aerial Manipulators (AMs) provide a versatile platform for various applications, including 3D printing, architecture, and aerial grasping missions. However, their operational speed is often sacrificed to uphold precision. Existing control strategies for AMs often regard the manipulator as a disturbance and employ robust control methods to mitigate its influence. This research focuses on elevating the precision of the end effector and enhancing the agility of aerial manipulator movements. We present a composite control scheme to address these challenges. Initially, a Nonlinear Disturbance Observer (NDOB) is utilized to compensate for internal coupling effects and external disturbances. Subsequently, manipulator dynamics are processed through a high pass filter to facilitate agile movements. By integrating the proposed control method into a fully autonomous delta-arm-based AM system, we substantiate the controller's efficacy through extensive real-world experiments. The outcomes illustrate that the end-effector can achieve accuracy at the millimeter level.

### [Flapping-Wing Flying Robot with Integrated Dual-Arm Scissors-Type Flora Sampling System]()

The flapping-wing robotic birds were inspired by nature to present an alternative way of thrust and lift generation instead of conventional high-speed rotary propellers in unmanned aerial platforms. The advances in flapping technology recently led to the prototyping of leg-claw mechanisms for perching and occasionally very lightweight arms for sampling or tiny object aerial manipulation. A dual-arm manipulator on top of a robotic bird might not be bio-inspired and safe in case of a collision with the environment or human-robot interaction. Here in this work, the previously designed dual-arm scissors-type manipulator has been improved in terms of workspace, mechanism, vision system, and blade placement to present a more natural way of sampling. The new dual-arm, with 100.2(g) weight, is redesigned inside a beak to have protection against possible collisions and also secure the cutting blades within a protected shield. During the flight, the dual-arm system is inside the cover and invisible; the lower beak is opened before manipulation and sets out the arm in a proper place for sampling. This new safety cover (beak) along with the new blade mechanism enhanced the cutting power and the safety of the operation. The experimental results show the successful cutting of a series of plant samples.

### [Reliable Aerial Manipulation: Combining Visual Tracking with Range Sensing for Robust Grasping]()

Reliable object localization is a critical challenge in drone-based aerial manipulation, particularly when objects are outside the camera's field of view. This paper presents a new approach to enhance drone reliability in aerial grasping tasks by integrating a 1D time-of-flight range sensor with a vision-based localization system. The range sensor, positioned beneath the drone, generates a detailed point cloud of the ground beneath the drone, allowing for precise object localization even when the drone hovers directly above the target. By combining visual tracking with real-time distance measurements, our system achieves a 96% grasp success rate across 128 trials with diverse objects, representing a significant improvement over previous approaches. This method enables zero-shot grasping without prior knowledge of the objects, increasing versatility and robustness in complex, unstructured environments. The open-source software and hardware design of the platform provides a foundation for further research and development in the field of autonomous aerial manipulation.

### [Safety-Critical Control for Aerial Physical Interaction in Uncertain Environment]()

Aerial manipulation for safe physical interaction with their environments is gaining significant momentum in robotics research. In this paper, we present a disturbance-observer-based safety-critical control for a fully actuated aerial manipulator interacting with both static and dynamic structures. Our approach centers on a safety filter that dynamically adjusts the desired trajectory of the vehicle's pose, accounting for the aerial manipulator's dynamics, the disturbance observer's structure, and motor thrust limits. We provide rigorous proof that the proposed safety filter ensures the forward invariance of the safety set—representing motor thrust limits—even in the presence of disturbance estimation errors. To demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing control strategies for aerial physical interaction, we perform comparative experiments involving complex tasks, such as pushing against a static structure and pulling a plug firmly attached to an electric socket. Furthermore, to highlight its repeatability in scenarios with sudden dynamic changes, we perform repeated tests of pushing a movable cart and extracting a plug from a socket. These experiments confirm that our method not only outperforms existing methods but also excels in handling tasks with rapid dynamic variations.

### [SPIBOT: A Drone-Tethered Mobile Gripper for Robust Aerial Object Retrieval in Dynamic Environments]()

In real-world field operations, aerial grasping systems face significant challenges in dynamic environments due to strong winds, shifting surfaces, and the need to handle heavy loads. Particularly when dealing with heavy objects, the powerful propellers of the drone can inadvertently blow the target object away as it approaches, making the task even more difficult. To address these challenges, we introduce SPIBOT, a novel drone-tethered mobile gripper system designed for robust and stable autonomous target retrieval. SPIBOT operates via a tether, much like a spider, allowing the drone to maintain a safe distance from the target. To ensure both stable mobility and secure grasping capabilities, SPIBOT is equipped with six legs and sensors to estimate the robot's and mission's states. It is designed with a reduced volume and weight compared to other hexapod robots, allowing it to be easily stowed under the drone and reeled in as needed. Designed for the 2024 MBZIRC Maritime Grand Challenge, SPIBOT is built to retrieve a 1kg target object in the highly dynamic conditions of the moving deck of a ship. This system integrates a real-time action selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts the robot's actions based on proximity to the mission goal and environmental conditions, enabling rapid and robust mission execution. Experimental results across various terrains, including a pontoon on a lake, a grass field, and rubber mats on coastal sand, demonstrate SPIBOT's ability to efficiently and reliably retrieve targets. SPIBOT swiftly converges on the target and completes its mission, even when dealing with irregular initial states and noisy information introduced by the drone.

### [GP-Based NMPC for Aerial Transportation of Suspended Loads]()

In this work, we leverage Gaussian Processes (GPs) and present a learning-based control scheme for the transportation of cable-suspended loads with multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Our ultimate goal is to approximate the model discrepancies that exist between the actual and nominal system dynamics. Towards this direction, weighted and sparse Gaussian Process (GP) regression is exploited so as to approximate online the model errors and guarantee real-time performance while also ensuring adaptability to the conditions prevailing in the outdoor environment where the UAV is deployed. The learned model errors are fed into a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC), formulated for the corrected system dynamics, which achieves the transportation of the UAV towards reference positions with simultaneous minimization of the cable angular motion, regardless of the outdoor conditions and the existence of external disturbances, primarily stemming from the unknown wind. The proposed scheme is validated through simulations and real-world experiments with an octorotor, demonstrating an 80% reduction in the steady-state position error under 4 Beaufort wind conditions compared to the nominal NMPC.

### [Knowledge-Driven Visual Target Navigation: Dual Graph Navigation]()

In unknown environments, navigating a robot by a given image to a specific location or instance is critical and challenging. The existing end-to-end approaches require simultaneous implicit learning of multiple subtasks, and modular approaches depend on metric information. Both approaches face high computational demands, often leading to difficulties in real-time updates and limited generalization, making them challenging to implement on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Graph Navigation (DGN), a knowledge-driven, lightweight image instance navigation framework. DGN builds an External Knowledge Graph (EKG) from small-scale datasets to capture prior object correlations, efficiently guiding target exploration. During exploration, DGN builds an Internal Knowledge Graph (IKG) using an instance-aware module, which records explored objects based on reachability relationships rather than precise metric information. The IKG dynamically updates the EKG, enhancing the robot's adaptability to the current environment. Together, they realize topological perception and reduce computational overhead. Furthermore, unlike approaches characterized by over-dependence between components, DGN employs a plug-and-play modular design that allows independent training and flexible replacement of functional modules, effectively enhancing generalization performance while reducing training and deployment costs. Experiments illustrate that DGN generalizes well in different simulation environments (AI2-THOR, Habitat), achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProcTHOR-10K dataset. It is compatible with three distinct real-world robot platforms, including edge computing devices without CUDA support. It exhibits a decision-making speed of 3.8 to 5.5 times over baseline methods. Further details can be found on the project page:https://dogplanningloyo.github.io/DGN/

### [Learning to Predict the Future from Monocular Vision for Efficient Human-Aware Navigation]()

Human-aware navigation (HAN) aims to build autonomous agents that robustly and naturally navigate in human-centered environments. Due to the complex and dynamic nature of this task, existing approaches typically rely on sophisticated pipelines that separately process perception and decision-making to solve it. In this work, we propose an Obstruction Distance Vector based End-to-End Model (ODVEEM), using monocular vision for navigation around humans. The Obstruction Distance Vector (ODV) is an intermediate representation in our model, leveraged to describe the Obstruction Distance to the first future collision in all possible directions in the horizontal field of view. As ODV cannot be calculated directly in the real world, we design a neural network for ODV estimation, formulating it as a classification problem with auxiliary proxy tasks, which play a key role in effectively predicting the implicit future motion of nearby humans. Taking advantage of ODV, ODVEEM supervised by human behavioral heuristics is employed to guide the agent to reach a goal efficiently and avoid potential collisions. Several challenging experiments show our method's substantial improvement over a number of baseline methods, attaining solid performance with zero-shot transfer to unseen simulated and real-world environments.

### [DP-Habitat: Bridging the Gap between Simulation and Reality for Visual Navigation in Dynamic Pedestrian Environments]()

Visual navigation in dynamic environments poses a considerable challenge, particularly in scenarios with diverse pedestrian behaviors. Traditional simulators primarily focus on static scenes, while existing dynamic pedestrian simulators often suffer limitations such as monotonous pedestrian models, lack of interaction with the environment, and constrained scenarios. These deficiencies lead to notable discrepancies from real-world dynamic pedestrian environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce DP-Habitat, a dynamic pedestrian simulator developed on the Habitat platform. DP-Habitat efficiently simulates a wide range of complex and realistic human behaviors, with flexible interactions between pedestrian models and environments. It also supports rapid deployment of pedestrian models across various scenes, thereby more accurately replicating the complexities of real-world dynamic pedestrian settings. Additionally, we present Adaptive Object Navigation with Dynamic Mapping (AON-DM), a novel baseline method specifically designed for dynamic pedestrian settings. AON-DM integrates real-time pedestrian tracking and predictive modeling with a hybrid path planning strategy, markedly improving navigation efficiency and success rates. Our experimental results reveal that dynamic pedestrians significantly affect visual navigation performance within DP-Habitat, with AON-DM achieving superior effectiveness compared to existing methods under these challenging conditions. Furthermore, our approach maintains high performance in real-world scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and robustness. The code and data are available at url{https://github.com/qinliangql/DP-Habitat.git}.

### [X-MOBILITY: End-To-End Generalizable Navigation Via World Modeling]()

General-purpose navigation in challenging environments remains a significant problem in robotics, with current state-of-the-art approaches facing myriad limitations. Classical approaches struggle with cluttered settings and require extensive tuning, while learning-based methods face difficulties generalizing to out-of-distribution environments. This paper introduces xmobility{}, an end-to-end generalizable navigation model that overcomes existing challenges by leveraging three key ideas. First, xmobility{} employs an auto-regressive world modeling architecture with a latent state space to capture world dynamics. Second, a diverse set of multi-head decoders enables the model to learn a rich state representation that correlates strongly with effective navigation skills. Third, by decoupling world modeling from action policy, our architecture can train effectively on a variety of data sources, both with and without expert policies—off-policy data allows the model to learn world dynamics, while on-policy data with supervisory control enables optimal action policy learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that xmobility{} not only generalizes effectively but also surpasses current state-of-the-art navigation approaches. Additionally, xmobility{} also achieves zero-shot Sim2Real transferability and shows strong potential for cross-embodiment generalization. Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/X-MOBILITY

### [Map-SemNav: Advancing Zero-Shot Continuous Vision-And-Language Navigation through Visual Semantics and Map Integration]()

This paper explores zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), enabling agents to generalize navigation to unseen data classes. Most current approaches rely on large models, but these are not specifically tailored for VLN, lacking direct learning from navigation environments and slowing down agents due to their overwhelming size. To tackle this, we propose Map-Semantic Zero-shot Navigation (Map-SemNav), which does not rely on large models for navigation planning. Map-SemNav utilizes three key cues: direction, object, and scene, to acquire relational knowledge instead of memorizing specific classes, which enables generalization to unseen data. Direction is guided by a top-down semantic map, while object and scene information is decoupled from environment knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Map-SemNav outperforms state-of-the-art large model-based methods in zero-shot VLN tasks within continuous environments, while also offering higher efficiency due to its simplified architecture.

### [Safer Gap: Safe Navigation of Planar Nonholonomic Robots with a Gap-Based Local Planner]()

This paper extends the gap-based navigation technique Potential Gap with safety guarantees at the local planning level for a kinematic planar nonholonomic robot model, leading to Safer Gap. It relies on a subset of navigable free space from the robot to a gap, denoted the keyhole region. The region is defined by the union of the largest collision-free disc centered on the robot and a collision-free trapezoidal region directed through the gap. Safer Gap first generates Bezier-based collision-free paths within the keyhole regions. The keyhole region of the top scoring path is encoded by a shallow neural network-based zeroing barrier function (ZBF) synthesized in real-time. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Keyhole ZBF constraints and output tracking of the Bezier path, synthesizes a safe kinematically feasible trajectory. The Potential Gap projection operator serves as a last action to enforce safety if the NMPC optimization fails to converge to a solution within the prescribed time. Simulation and experimental validation of Safer Gap confirm its collision-free navigation properties.

### [Bathymetric Surveying with Imaging Sonar Using Neural Volume Rendering]()

This research addresses the challenge of estimating bathymetry from imaging sonars where the state-of-the-art works have primarily relied on either supervised learning with ground-truth labels or surface rendering based on the Lambertian assumption. In this letter, we propose a novel, self-supervised framework based on volume rendering for reconstructing bathymetry using forward-looking sonar (FLS) data collected during standard surveys. We represent the seafloor as a neural heightmap encapsulated with a parametric multi-resolution hash encoding scheme and model the sonar measurements with a differentiable renderer using sonar volumetric rendering employed with hierarchical sampling techniques. Additionally, we model the horizontal and vertical beam patterns and estimate them jointly with the bathymetry. We evaluate the proposed method quantitatively on simulation and field data collected by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) during low-altitude surveys. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches that use imaging sonars for seabed mapping. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach can potentially be used to increase the resolution of a low-resolution prior map with FLS data from low-altitude surveys.

### [Diver to Robot Communication Underwater]()

Gesture-based communication is a standard underwater communication strategy that is taught to divers as part of their regular diver training and it would seem a natural mechanism to leverage for diver to robot communication underwater. Enabling an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to understand such sequences would involve having the robot learn the large set of gestures that divers use and the way they are combined. As perfect transcription of gestures is unlikely, the communication process also requires an error-correcting framework to ensure that communication is clear and correct. Here we describe an interactive process that provides this infrastructure. A weakly supervised transfer learning approach is used to recognize standard SCUBA gestures in individual video frames and within a Sim2Real process to train a LSTM to recognize gesture sequences. This process is placed within a per-gesture and per-sequence interaction process to assist and confirm the recognition of individual gestures and to confirm entire gesture sequences. Individual aspects of this process and complete end-to-end operation are demonstrated using an unmanned underwater vehicle.

### [SIMP: Energy and Time-Efficient Real-Time 3D Motion Planning for Bio-Inspired AUVs]()

Underwater navigation is an area of increasing research interest due to its fundamental complexity and industrial applications. Though, due to convenience and current theoretical understanding, the vast majority of underwater platforms utilize thrusters, while other forms of propulsion, such as undulation locomotion, have been given limited exposure. This paper provides the first real-time motion planning framework that produces energy and time efficient paths with empirical local optimality for articulated swimming robots in 3D, called SIMP. SIMP utilizes learned associations between parameterized dynamically feasible undulatory gaits with their expected energy cost, velocity, and swept-out volume of the robot during execution, to formulate a simplified optimization problem that decides the path to be followed with the corresponding consecutive gaits, and navigates the robot safely in complex 3D environments. The proposed pipeline is tested in numerical experiments with realistic dynamics for a 10-link underwater snake robot (USR) with anguilliform gaits, in simulated cluttered environments of significant challenge, displaying real-time replanning performance of more than 1 Hz.

### [End-To-End Underwater Multi-View Stereo for Dense Scene Reconstruction]()

Recent advancements in learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) have demonstrated significant improvements over traditional counterpart, primarily due to the extensive availability of multi-view training images with ground-truth metric depths in the terrestrial in-air domain. However, underwater multi-view stereo (UwMVS) faces substantial challenges arising from the domain gap between in-air and underwater environments, leading to degraded performance when applying in-air MVS models to underwater scenarios. Furthermore, the progress of learning-based UwMVS methods has been hindered by the scarcity of underwater multi-view images with ground-truth depth maps and point clouds. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a physically-guided approach for synthesizing underwater multi-view images and present the first large-scale UwMVS dataset for end-to-end training and evaluation of learning-based UwMVS methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel UwMVS network that enhances geometric cue encoding to achieve more accurate and complete point cloud reconstruction. Extensive experiments on our dataset and real-world underwater scenes demonstrate that our dataset enables the trained models for underwater dense reconstruction and that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater reconstruction. Dataset, code and appendix are available at: https://cuhk-usr-group.github.io/UwMVS/

### [UR-MVO: Robust Monocular Visual Odometry for Underwater Scenarios]()

Visual odometry (VO) in underwater environments presents significant challenges due to poor visibility and dynamic scene changes, which render conventional (in-air) VO solutions unsuitable for underwater applications. We propose an underwater robust monocular visual odometry (UR-MVO) pipeline tailored for underwater scenarios with feature extraction and matching based on SuperPoint and SuperGlue models, respectively. We enhance the robustness of the feature extractor through field-specific fine-tuning of the SuperPoint model using few-shot unsupervised learning. This tuning was done on real images of underwater scenes in order to enhance its performance in the harsh underwater image conditions. Moreover, we integrate semantic segmentation trained on underwater images into our pipeline to eliminate unreliable features belonging to dynamic objects and background. We evaluated the proposed solution on the Aqualoc dataset, demonstrating higher localization accuracy compared to other SOTA direct and feature-based monocular VO methods like DSO and SVO and also obtained very competitive results compared to more resource-intensive monocular VSLAM approaches with loop closure process like LDSO, UVS, and ORB-SLAM. The results show a high potential for our approach for further applications in underwater exploration and mapping using affordable sensory setups. We publish the code for the benefit of the community https://github.com/be2rlab/UR-MVO

### [SeaSplat: Representing Underwater Scenes with 3D Gaussian Splatting and a Physically Grounded Image Formation Model]()

We introduce SeaSplat, a method to enable real-time rendering of underwater scenes leveraging recent advances in 3D radiance fields. Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium. We show that the underwater image formation helps learn scene structure, with better depth maps, as well as show that our improvements maintain the significant computational improvements afforded by leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation

### [ProNav: Proprioceptive Traversability Estimation for Legged Robot Navigation in Outdoor Environments]()

We propose a novel method, ProNav, which uses proprioceptive signals for traversability estimation in challenging outdoor terrains for autonomous legged robot navigation. Our approach uses sensor data from a legged robot’s joint encoders, force, and current sensors to measure the joint positions, forces, and current consumption respectively to accurately assess a terrain’s stability, resistance to the robot’s motion, risk of entrapment, and crash. Based on these factors, we compute the appropriate robot gait to maximize stability, which leads to reduced energy consumption. Our approach can also be used to predict imminent crashes in challenging terrains and execute behaviors to preemptively avoid them. We integrate ProNav with an exteroceptive-based method to navigate realworld environments with dense vegetation, high granularity, negative obstacles, etc. Our method shows an improvement up to 40% in terms of success rate and up to 15.1% reduction in terms of energy consumption compared to exteroceptive-based methods.

### [MOVE: Multi-Skill Omnidirectional Legged Locomotion with Limited View in 3D Environments]()

Legged robots possess inherent advantages in traversing complex 3D terrains. However, previous work on low-cost quadruped robots with egocentric vision systems has been limited by a narrow front-facing view and exteroceptive noise, restricting omnidirectional mobility in such environments. While building a voxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing, it introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this paper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of multi-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D environments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with the robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion, enabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the direction of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies on proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all these skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese network structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the robot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view. Experiments in both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the robustness of our method, broadening the operational environments for robotics with egocentric vision.

### [Generating Diverse Challenging Terrains for Legged Robots Using Quality-Diversity Algorithm]()

While legged robots have achieved significant advancements in recent years, ensuring the robustness of their controllers on unstructured terrains remains challenging. It requires generating diverse and challenging unstructured terrains to test the robot and discover its vulnerabilities. This topic remains underexplored in the literature. This paper presents a Quality-Diversity framework to generate diverse and challenging terrains that uncover weaknesses in legged robot controllers. Our method, applied to both simulated bipedal and quadruped robots, produces an archive of terrains optimized to challenge the controller in different ways. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the generated archive effectively contains terrains that the robots struggled to traverse, presenting different failure modes. Interesting results were observed, including failure cases that were not necessarily expected. Experiments show that the generated terrains can also be used to improve RL-based controllers.

This paper presents the addition of two models for added mass to the Fluid-Field Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (FF-SLIP) Model for legged swimming. The relative ability of these models to capture the increased fluid forces due to virtual mass displacement is evaluated using a two-legged swimming robot, Tadpole. We show that a simple addition to our reduced-order model can predict fluid-leg interaction forces while remaining computationally efficient.

### [A Virtual Gravity Controller for Efficient Underactuated Biped Robots]()

This paper introduces a virtual gravity controller for underactuated biped robots. A bio-inspired model of passive bipedal walking is used as the basis for the controller's design. An analytical expression of the controller is obtained, allowing on-line implementations of the developed control scheme. Following a design modification tailored to the controller, the robot is able to reproduce its passive gait even on level-ground. The results are verified via independent high-fidelity physics simulations of the real robot's digital twin. The active robot demonstrates significant dynamic convergence to the passive model's dynamics, with only minor motorization efforts. The developed control scheme showcases robustness and energetic efficiency, and leads the way to a design-oriented approach in active biped locomotion.

### [Stair Climbing of a Transformable Robot Using Varying Leg-Wheel Contact Points]()

Staircases are a challenging terrain frequently encountered in urban environments. While leg-wheel robots take advantage of having both legged and wheeled modes, their ability to negotiate stairs still requires careful planning. This paper presents a novel approach to developing a stair-climbing behavior for leg-wheel transformable robots. A comprehensive stair-climbing strategy is constructed by analyzing the workspace of the leg-wheel mechanism, considering the position of the robot’s center of mass, and accounting for foothold displacement owing to the possible leg-wheel forward rolling motion. This strategy enables the robot to safely navigate stairs using its leg-wheel's appropriate parts. Stability during transitions between steps is ensured, and an optimized swing trajectory is proposed to minimize slippage and impact. The approach is validated through simulations and further tested experimentally on staircases with treads of 27 cm and risers of 12 cm, as well as staircases with treads of 24 cm and risers of 14 cm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

### ["Hierarchy of Needs" for Robots: Control Synthesis for Compositions of Hierarchical, Complex Objectives]()

Drawing inspiration from Maslow's "hierarchy of needs", this paper develops a real-time control synthesis framework for robots to address hierarchical, complex objectives, recognizing that their behaviors are inherently driven by underlying needs. Each need is encoded by the zero-superlevel set of a control barrier function (CBF), which can be time-varying, and all the needs at the same level in a hierarchy are composed into a single one through Boolean compositions of the corresponding CBFs. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a hypothetical interstellar exploration mission using laboratory robots, and novel results on nonsmooth CBF and time-varying CBF are derived.

### [RM4D: A Combined Reachability and Inverse Reachability Map for Common 6-/7-Axis Robot Arms by Dimensionality Reduction to 4D]()

Knowledge of a manipulator’s workspace is fundamental for a variety of tasks including robot design, grasp planning and robot base placement. Consequently, workspace representations are well studied in robotics. Two important representations are reachability maps and inverse reachability maps. The former predicts whether a given end-effector pose is reachable from where the robot currently is, and the latter suggests suitable base positions for a desired end-effector pose. Typically, the reachability map is built by discretizing the 6D space containing the robot’s workspace and determining, for each cell, whether it is reachable or not. The reachability map is subsequently inverted to build the inverse map. This is a cumbersome process which restricts the applications of such maps. In this work, we exploit commonalities of existing six and seven axis robot arms to reduce the dimension of the discretization from 6D to 4D. We propose Reachability Map 4D (RM4D), a map that only requires a single 4D data structure for both forward and inverse queries. This gives a much more compact map that can be constructed by an order of magnitude faster than existing maps, with no inversion overheads and no loss in accuracy. Finally, we showcase the efficiency gains by applying RM4D for finding suitable base positions in a scenario with 800 target grasps.

### [An Average-Distance Minimizing Motion Sweep for Bounded Spatial Objects and Its Application in B´ezier-Like Freeform Motion Generation]()

This paper uses the ellipsoidal parameters associated with volume moments of inertia of a bounded solid object to construct a motion sweep joining two poses of the solid object, in contrast to earlier works on motion interpolation in SE(3) without taking into account the shape of the moving object. The paper borrows the concept of shape-dependent object norms introduced by Kazerounian and Rastegar and refined by Chirikjian and Zhou to compute as a metric the average of the squared distances (or ASD) among all homologous points of the bounded body between two given poses and seeks to obtain an optimal interpolating motion that minimizes a combination of two ASD distances from each intermediate pose to the two given poses. It is found that the ASD minimizing motion sweep is a novel straight-line motion such that while the centroid of the object follows a straight line, the orientation of the object is constrained so that the ASD metric is minimized. Furthermore, the rotational component can be determined by polar decomposition of the linearly interpolated rotation matrices, scaled by the object's inertia parameters. As an illustration of one of its applications, this motion sweep is repeatedly applied using the de Casteljau algorithm to generate Bézier-like freeform motions, whose paths are in general dependent on the shape of the inertia ellipsoid.

### [Geometric Static Modeling Framework for Piecewise-Continuous Curved-Link Multi Point-Of-Contact Tensegrity Robots]()

Tensegrities synergistically combine tensile (cable) and rigid (link) elements to achieve structural integrity, making them lightweight, packable, and impact resistant. Consequently, they have high potential for locomotion in unstructured environments. This research presents geometric modeling of a Tensegrity eXploratory Robot (TeXploR) comprised of two semi-circular, curved links held together by 12 prestressed cables and actuated with an internal mass shifting along each link. This design allows for efficient rolling with stability (e.g., tip-over on an incline). However, the unique design poses static and dynamic modeling challenges given the discontinuous nature of the semi-circular, curved links, two changing points of contact with the surface plane, and instantaneous movement of the masses along the links. The robot is modeled using a geometric approach where the holonomic constraints confirm the experimentally observed four-state hybrid system, proving TeXploR rolls along one link while pivoting about the end of the other. It also identifies the quasi-static state transition boundaries that enable a continuous change in the robot states via internal mass shifting. This is the first time in literature a non-spherical two-point contact system is kinematically and geometrically modeled. Furthermore, the static solutions are closed-form and do not require numerical exploration of the solution. The MATLAB® simulations are experimentally validated on a tetherless prototype with mean absolute error of 4.36° for the arc angles of the points of contact.

### [GISR: Geometric Initialization and Silhouette-Based Refinement for Single-View Robot Pose and Configuration Estimation]()

In autonomous robotics, measurement of the robot’s internal state and perception of its environment, including interaction with other agents such as collaborative robots, are essential. Estimating the pose of the robot arm from a single view has the potential to replace classical eye-to-hand calibration approaches and is particularly attractive for online estimation and dynamic environments. In addition to its pose, recovering the robot configuration provides a complete spatial understanding of the observed robot that can be used to anticipate the actions of other agents in advanced robotics use cases. Furthermore, this additional redundancy enables the planning and execution of recovery protocols in case of sensor failures or external disturbances. We introduce GISR - a deep configuration and robot-to-camera pose estimation method that prioritizes execution in real-time. GISR consists of two modules: (i) a geometric initialization module that efficiently computes an approximate robot pose and configuration, and (ii) a deep iterative silhouette-based refinement module that arrives at a final solution in just a few iterations. We evaluate GISR on publicly available data and show that it outperforms existing methods of the same class in terms of both speed and accuracy, and can compete with approaches that rely on ground-truth proprioception and recover only the pose. Our code will be available at https://github.com/iwhitey/GISR-robot.

### [Stop-N-Go: Search-Based Conflict Resolution for Motion Planning of Multiple Robotic Manipulators]()

We address the motion planning problem for multiple robotic manipulators in packed environments where shared workspace can result in goal positions occupied or blocked by other robots unless those other robots move away to make the goal positions free. While planning in a coupled configuration space (C-space) is straightforward, it struggles to scale with the number of robots and often fails to find solutions. Decoupled planning is faster but frequently leads to conflicts between trajectories. We propose a conflict resolution approach that inserts pauses into individually planned trajectories using an A*search strategy to minimize the makespan--the total time until all robots complete their tasks. This method allows some robots to stop, enabling others to move without collisions, and maintains short distances in the C-space. It also effectively handles cases where goal positions are initially blocked by other robots. Experimental results show that our method successfully solves challenging instances where baseline methods fail to find feasible solutions.

### [Constrained Nonlinear Kaczmarz Projection on Intersections of Manifolds for Coordinated Multi-Robot Mobile Manipulation]()

Cooperative manipulation tasks impose various structure-, task-, and robot-specific constraints on mobile manipulators. However, current methods struggle to model and solve these myriad constraints simultaneously. We propose a twofold solution: first, we model constraints as a family of manifolds amenable to simultaneous solving. Second, we introduce the constrained nonlinear Kaczmarz (cNKZ) projection technique to produce constraint-satisfying solutions. Experiments show that cNKZ dramatically outperforms baseline approaches, which cannot find solutions at all. We integrate cNKZ with a sampling-based motion planning algorithm to generate complex, coordinated motions for 3--6 mobile manipulators (18--36 DoF), with cNKZ solving up to 80 nonlinear constraints simultaneously and achieving up to a 92% success rate in cluttered environments. We also demonstrate our approach on hardware using three Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi robots with OpenMANIPULATOR-X arms.

### [Targeted Parallelization of Conflict-Based Search for Multi-Robot Path Planning]()

Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP) on graphs, also known as Multi-Agent PathFinding (MAPF), is a well-established NP-hard problem with critically important applications. In (near)-optimally solving MRPP, as serial computation approaches its efficiency limits, parallelization offers a promising route to extend that limit further. As a single solution is unlikely to be successful in addressing all settings, e.g., in handling small/hard or large/sparse MRPP instances, in this study, we explore a targeted parallelization effort to boost the performance of conflict-based search for MRPP. Specifically, when instances are relatively small but robots are densely packed with strong interactions, we devise a decentralized parallel algorithm that concurrently explores multiple branches that leads to markedly enhanced solution discovery. On the other hand, for large problems with sparse robot-robot interactions, we find that prioritizing node expansion and conflict resolution more promising. Our innovative multi-threaded approach to parallelizing bounded-suboptimal conflict search-based algorithms demonstrates significant improvements over baseline serial methods in success rate or runtime. Our work furthers the understanding of MRPP and charts a promising path for elevating solution quality and computational efficiency through parallel algorithmic strategies.

### [Heuristically Guided Compilation for Task Assignment and Path Finding]()

We investigate the Combined Target-Assignment and Path-Finding (TAPF) problem that computes both task assignments and collision-free paths for multiple agents, that is, each agent is required to select a target from an underlying set, reaching which leads to a payoff. There is a cost closely related to the time required for each agent to reach the goal. The objective is to maximize the minimum gain generated by the agents. We proposed a Compilation-Based Approach with Heuristics (TA-CBWH) to approximate the optimal solution, behind which are two critical ideas: (i) for a specific task assignment, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) and create the iteration combined with large neighborhood search (LNS) to improve the solution quality to near-optimal quickly; (ii) regarding distinct task assignments, a switching mechanism is developed to determine the most promising iteration while progressively eliminating unnecessary task assignments. Comparative experiments demonstrate that TA-CBWH outperforms a wide range of existing approaches across various maps and different numbers of agents.

### [Safety-Guaranteed Distributed Formation Control of Multi-Robot Systems Over Graphs with Rigid and Elastic Edges]()

This paper considers the problem of formation control of multi-robot systems represented by a graph featuring both rigid and elastic edges, capturing specified range tolerance to the desired inter-robot distances. The objective is to navigate the robots safely through unknown environments with obstacles, utilizing onboard sensors like LiDAR while maintaining inter-robot distance constraints. To this end, a novel cooperative control algorithm is proposed, employing quadratic programming and leveraging control barrier functions to integrate multiple control objectives seamlessly. This approach ensures a unified strategy and provides a safety certificate. Experimental validation of the proposed cooperative control algorithm is conducted using a robotic testbed.

### [Safety-Critical Control with Saliency Detection for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Multi-Obstacle Environments]()

This paper proposes a novel dual-filter architecture utilizing RGB-D camera data and dynamic control barrier functions (D-CBFs) for real-time obstacle avoidance in unstructured environments. The proposed method efficiently handles static, suddenly appearing, and dynamic obstacles, maintaining consistent computational performance across diverse scenarios. To achieve this, two key challenges must be addressed. First, the substantial volume of pixel and depth map data requires robust, real-time processing for efficient D-CBF construction. Second, constructing D-CBFs for each obstacle in multi-obstacle scenarios increases optimization solver time. To address these challenges, we adapt the concept of salient object detection (SOD), proposing an enhanced FastSOD (E-FastSOD) method for rapid risk area identification. This approach rapidly filters out low-risk areas, while high-risk regions are mathematically represented utilizing the proposed enhanced minimal bounding circle (E-MBC) technique. We differentiate static and dynamic obstacles by comparing current and previous MBC states, employing Kalman filtering for obstacle state prediction. This setup enables efficient online D-CBF construction for each MBC, balancing computational speed with accurate obstacle representation. Subsequently, the second filter establishes buffer zones around established D-CBFs, activating only those corresponding to zones the robot actually enters, rather than all D-CBFs to increase real-time performance. We prove the system's safety and asymptotic stabilization under this architecture. Simulated and real-world experiments validate our method, demonstrating an equipped mobile robot's ability to accomplish tasks while ensuring safety across diverse, unknown scenarios.

### [Safe Coverage for Heterogeneous Systems with Limited Connectivity]()

An ongoing challenge for emergency deployments is operating multi-robot teams of diverse agents under communication constraints---where inter-agent connectivity is rare. Thus, heterogeneous systems must autonomously adapt to changing conditions while maintaining safety. In this work, we develop an algorithm for heterogeneous, decentralized multi-robot systems to independently manage safety constraints with provable guarantees for safety and communication for a coverage task. We demonstrate this algorithm in scenarios where up to 100 agents must navigate a simulated cluttered environment with safety constraints that change as agents observe hazards. Further, we show that the performance of a system with a largely disconnected network is equivalent to a fully connected communication network, suggesting that treating connectivity as a constraint may be unnecessary with an appropriate control strategy.

### [Safe Control of Quadruped in Varying Dynamics Via Safety Index Adaptation]()

Varying dynamics pose a fundamental difficulty when deploying safe control laws in the real world. Safety Index Synthesis (SIS) deeply relies on the system dynamics and once the dynamics change, the previously synthesized safety index becomes invalid. In this work, we show the real-time efficacy of Safety Index Adaptation (SIA) in varying dynamics. SIA enables real-time adaptation to the changing dynamics so that the adapted safe control law can still guarantee 1) forward invariance within a safe region and 2) finite time convergence to that safe region. This work employs SIA on a package-carrying quadruped robot, where the payload weight changes in real-time. SIA updates the safety index when the dynamics change, e.g., a change in payload weight, so that the quadruped can avoid obstacles while achieving its performance objectives. Numerical study provides theoretical guarantees for SIA and a series of hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SIA in real-world deployment in avoiding obstacles under varying dynamics.

### [Updating Robot Safety Representations Online from Natural Language Feedback]()

Robots must operate safely when deployed in novel and human-centered environments, like homes. Current safe control approaches typically assume that the safety constraints are known a priori, and thus, the robot can pre-compute a corresponding safety controller. While this may make sense for some safety constraints (e.g., avoiding collision with walls by analyzing a floor plan), other constraints are more complex (e.g., spills), inherently personal, context-dependent, and can only be identified at deployment time when the robot is interacting in a specific environment and with a specific person (e.g., fragile objects, expensive rugs). Here, language provides a flexible mechanism to communicate these evolving safety constraints to the robot. In this work, we use vision language models (VLMs) to interpret language feedback and the robot’s image observations to continuously update the robot’s representation of safety constraints. With these inferred constraints, we update a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability safety controller to efficiently update the robot controller to ensure ongoing safety. Through simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate the robot’s ability to infer and respect language-based safety constraints with the proposed approach.

### [Detecting Perception-Based Attacks Using Visual Odometry: Inconsistency Modeling and Checking on Robotic States]()

Perception systems in robotic vehicles are crucial for safe and efficient operation, providing key state estimates necessary for planning and control. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to perception-based attacks, such as odometry spoofing, position spoofing, obstacle hiding, and object misclassification, which can lead to catastrophic failures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect perception-based attacks by modeling inconsistencies between the physical and estimated states of the robot. Our approach offers a unified methodology for detecting different types of attacks with high accuracy and minimal computational overhead. We validate our method through extensive simulations and real-world scenarios, achieving a 99.5% success rate in detecting attacks, while maintaining a low latency (within 100ms).

### [Distributed Perception Aware Safe Leader Follower System Via Control Barrier Methods]()

This paper addresses a distributed leader-follower formation control problem for a group of agents, each using a body-fixed camera with a limited field of view (FOV) for state estimation. The main challenge arises from the need to coordinate the agents’ movements with their cameras’ FOV to maintain visibility of the leader for accurate and reliable state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perception-aware distributed leader-follower safe control scheme that incorporates FOV limits as state constraints. A Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program is employed to ensure the forward invariance of a safety set defined by these constraints. Furthermore, new neural network based and double bounding boxes based estimators, combined with temporal filters, are developed to estimate system states directly from real-time image data, providing consistent performance across various environments. Comparison results in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in two distinct environments.

### [Gesturing towards Efficient Robot Control: Exploring Sensor Placement and Control Modes for Mid-Air Human-Robot Interaction]()

While collaborative robots effectively combine robotic precision with human capabilities, traditional control methods such as button presses or hand guidance can be slow and physically demanding. This has led to an increasing interest in natural user interfaces that integrate hand gesture-based interactions for more intuitive and flexible robot control. Therefore, this paper systematically explores mid-air robot control by comparing position and rate control modes with different state-of-the-art and novel sensor placements. A user study was conducted to evaluate each combination in terms of accuracy, task duration, perceived workload, and physical exertion. Our results indicate that position control is more efficient than rate control. Traditional desk-mounted sensors can provide a good balance between accuracy and comfort. However, robot-mounted sensors are a viable alternative for short-term, accurate control with less spatial requirements. Leg-mounted sensors, while comfortable, pose challenges to hand-eye coordination. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for improving the usability and comfort of mid-air human-robot interaction. Future research should extend this evaluation to a wider range of tasks and environments.

### [Understanding Dynamic Human-Robot Proxemics in the Case of Four-Legged Canine-Inspired Robots]()

The integration of humanoid and animal-shaped robots into specialized domains, such as healthcare, multi-terrain operations, and psychotherapy, necessitates a deep understanding of proxemics—the study of spatial behavior that governs effective human-robot interactions. Unlike traditional robots in manufacturing or logistics, these robots must navigate complex human environments where maintaining appropriate physical and psychological distances is crucial for seamless interaction. This study explores the application of proxemics in human-robot interactions, focusing specifically on quadruped robots, which present unique challenges and opportunities due to their lifelike movement and form. Utilizing a motion capture system, we examine how different interaction postures of a canine robot influence human participants' proxemic behavior in dynamic scenarios. By capturing and analyzing position and orientation data, this research aims to identify key factors that affect proxemic distances and inform the design of socially acceptable robots. The findings underscore the importance of adhering to human psychological and physical distancing norms in robot design, ensuring that autonomous systems can coexist harmoniously with humans.

### [Autonomous Navigation in Crowded Space Using Multi-Sensory Data Fusion]()

Autonomous navigation in crowded environments remains a significant challenge due to the highly dynamic and unpredictable nature of pedestrian movements. This paper presents a novel approach for socially-compliant crowd navigation by leveraging human pose tracking, trajectory prediction, and obstacle avoidance techniques. We introduce PoseTrajNet, an end-to-end autonomous agent navigation pipeline that integrates YOLOv8 for object detection, BlazePose for real-time human pose estimation, and a custom trajectory prediction model drawing on concepts from Social GANs. PoseTrajNet employs pose keypoints as socially-compliant features to anticipate pedestrian trajectories, enabling proactive path planning and dynamic safe radius adjustments for obstacle avoidance. Extensive evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate PoseTrajNet's effectiveness in seamless crowd navigation, outperforming baselines while adhering to social norms.

### [Feasibility-Aware Imitation Learning from Observation through a Hand-Mounted Demonstration Interface]()

Imitation learning through a demonstration interface is expected to learn policies for robot automation from intuitive human demonstrations. However, due to the differences in human and robot movement characteristics, a human expert might unintentionally demonstrate an action that the robot cannot execute. We propose feasibility-aware behavior cloning from observation (FABCO). In the FABCO framework, the feasibility of each demonstration is assessed using the robot's pre-trained forward and inverse dynamics models. This feasibility information is provided as visual feedback to the demonstrators, encouraging them to refine their demonstrations. During policy learning, estimated feasibility serves as a weight for the demonstration data, improving both the data efficiency and the robustness of the learned policy. We experimentally validated FABCO's effectiveness by applying it to a pipette insertion task involving a pipette and a vial. Four participants assessed the impact of the feasibility feedback and the weighted policy learning in FABCO. Additionally, we used the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) to evaluate the workload induced by demonstrations with visual feedback.

### [Human-Robot Collaboration for the Remote Control of Mobile Humanoid Robots with Torso-Arm Coordination]()

Recently, many humanoid robots have been increasingly deployed in various facilities, including hospitals and assisted living environments, where they are often remotely controlled by human operators. Their kinematic redundancy enhances reachability and manipulability, enabling them to navigate complex, cluttered environments and perform a wide range of tasks. However, this redundancy also presents significant control challenges, particularly in coordinating the movements of the robot's macro-micro structure (torso and arms). Therefore, we propose various human-robot collaborative (HRC) methods for coordinating the torso and arm of remotely controlled mobile humanoid robots, aiming to balance autonomy and human input to enhance system efficiency and task execution. The proposed methods include human-initiated approaches, where users manually control torso movements, and robot-initiated approaches, which autonomously coordinate torso and arm based on factors such as reachability, task goal, or inferred human intent. We conducted a user study with N=17 participants to compare the proposed approaches in terms of task performance, manipulability, and energy efficiency, and analyzed which methods were preferred by participants.

### [Soft Human-Robot Handover Using a Vision-Based Pipeline]()

Handing over objects is an essential task in human-robot collaborative scenarios. Previous studies have predominantly employed rigid grippers to perform the handover, focusing their efforts on the generation of grasps that avoid physical contact with people. In this paper, instead, we present a vision-based open-palm handover solution where a soft robotic hand exploits on purpose the contact with the human hand for improved grasp success and robustness. In particular, the human-robot physical interaction allows the robotic hand to slide over the human palm surface and firmly cage the object. The identification of the human hand plane and the object pose is achieved through a versatile perception pipeline that exploits a single RGB-D camera. Through several experimental trials we show that the system achieves successful grasps over multiple objects with different geometries and textures. We also conduct a comparative analysis between the proposed soft handover method and a baseline approach, evaluating their robustness to uncertainties on the object position. Lastly, a user study with 30 participants is conducted to evaluate the users’ perception of the human-robot interaction during the handover. Obtained results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline with different users and an overall users’ preference for the soft handover.

### [Utilizing Bioinspired Soft Modular Appendages for Grasping and Locomotion in Multi-Legged Robots on Ground and Underwater]()

Soft robots can adapt to their environments, which makes them suitable for deploying in disaster areas and agricultural fields, where their mobility is constrained by complex terrain. One of the main challenges in developing soft terrestrial robots is that the robot must be soft enough to adapt to its environment, but also rigid enough to exert adequate force on the ground to locomote. In this letter, we report a pneumatically driven, soft modular appendage made of silicone for a terrestrial robot capable of generating specific mechanical movement to locomote in the desired direction. We used Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations to assess the soft leg’s bending behavior, validated against the physical leg. In addition, we performed blocked force analysis to understand its force generation capabilities. We developed a soft-rigid- bodied tethered robot prototype and tested it on the ground and underwater environments to evaluate its locomotion performance. The robot demonstrated successful forward and backward movement as well as left and right turns, both on the ground and underwater. We explored the object manipulation and transportation capability of the robot by adding two additional soft appendages as a gripper. The robot demonstrated its ability to effectively manipulate and transport objects of varying nature, including rigid items such as a 3D-printed plastic box and fragile objects like an egg. The maximum load-carrying capacity of the robot was also investigated both on the ground and the aquatic medium. Our design approach provides a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient method for creating versatile soft appendages for a robot that is capable of terradynamic locomotion. This approach showcases its potential applicability in underwater search and rescue missions.

### [Design of a Novel Pneumatic Soft Gripper for Robust Adaptive Grasping]()

Soft grippers have shown promising performance in safe and adaptive grasping tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations in grasping force. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel pneumatic three-finger soft gripper to achieve robust adaptive grasping. The gripper consists of three identical fingers, each containing a pneumatic bending soft actuator and a pneumatic lateral soft actuator. The bending actuator features a tilted pneumatic network structure, which provides superior bending performance compared to traditional vertical pneumatic network structure. The lateral actuator is equipped with three deflection chambers at the finger root to mimic the lateral motions of a human finger. Kinematic and static models are established to predict the bending angle and grasping force of the soft finger under pressurized air. The performance of the proposed soft finger is analyzed through finite element simulations, and the effect of the chamber tilt angle is also examined. The theoretical and simulation results are compared to verify the validity of the analytical models. Finally, the proposed soft gripper is fabricated by 3D printing and molding. Experimental results show that the gripper is capable of grasping various objects of different sizes, shapes, materials, and weights, and can perform dexterous manipulation tasks, such as cap unscrewing. The proposed soft gripper exhibits significant potential for applications in robotic robust grasping tasks.

### [Hybrid Gripper with Passive Pneumatic Soft Joints for Grasping Deformable Thin Objects]()

Grasping a variety of objects remains a key challenge in the development of versatile robotic systems. The human hand is remarkably dexterous, capable of grasping and manipulating objects with diverse shapes, mechanical properties, and textures. Inspired by how humans use two fingers to pick up thin and large objects such as fabric or sheets of paper, we aim to develop a gripper optimized for grasping such deformable objects. Observing how the soft and flexible fingertip joints of the hand approach and grasp thin materials, a hybrid gripper design that incorporates both soft and rigid components was proposed. The gripper utilizes a soft pneumatic ring wrapped around a rigid revolute joint to create a flexible two-fingered gripper. Experiments were conducted to characterize and evaluate the gripper's performance in handling sheets of paper and other objects. Compared to rigid grippers, the proposed design improves grasping efficiency and reduces the gripping distance by up to eightfold.

### [Dexterous Three-Finger Gripper Based on Offset Trimmed Helicoids]()

This study presents an innovative offset-trimmed helicoids (OTH) structure, featuring a tunable deformation center that emulates the flexibility of human fingers. This design significantly reduces the actuation force needed for larger elastic deformations, particularly when dealing with harder materials like thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The incorporation of two helically routed tendons within the finger enables both in-plane bending and lateral out-of-plane transitions, effectively expanding its workspace and allowing for variable curvature along its length. Compliance analysis indicates that the compliance at the fingertip can be fine-tuned by adjusting the mounting placement of the fingers. This customization enhances the gripper's adaptability to a diverse range of objects. By leveraging TPU's substantial elastic energy storage capacity, the gripper is capable of dynamically rotating objects at high speeds, achieving approximately 60° in just 15 milliseconds. The three-finger gripper, with its high dexterity across six degrees of freedom, has demonstrated the capability to successfully perform intricate tasks. One such example is the adept spinning of a rod within the gripper's grasp.

### [Improving Grip Stability Using Passive Compliant Microspine Arrays for Soft Robots in Unstructured Terrain]()

Microspine grippers are small spines commonly found on insect legs that reinforce surface interaction by engaging with asperities to increase shear force and traction. An array of such microspines, when integrated into the limbs or undercarriage of a robot, can provide the ability to maneuver uneven terrains, traverse inclines, and even climb walls. Meanwhile, the conformability and adaptability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates for applications involving traversal of complex, unstructured terrains. However, there remains a real-life realization gap for soft locomotors pertaining to their transition from controlled lab environment to the field that can be bridged by improving grip stability through effective integration of microspines. In this research, a passive, compliant microspine stacked array design is proposed to enhance the locomotion capabilities of mobile soft robots. A microspine array integration method effectively addresses the stiffness mismatch between soft, compliant, and rigid components. Additionally, a reduction in complexity results from actuation of the surface-conformable soft limb using a single actuator. The two-row, stacked microspine array configuration offers improved gripping capabilities on steep and irregular surfaces. This design is incorporated into three different robot configurations - the baseline without microspines and two others with different combinations of microspine arrays. Field experiments are conducted on surfaces of varying surface roughness and non-uniformity - concrete, brick, compact sand, and tree roots. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of microspine arrays increases planar displacement an average of 10 times. The improved grip stability, repeatability, and, terrain traversability is reflected by a decrease in the relative standard deviation of the locomotion gaits.

### [Hybrid Soft Pneumatic and Tendon Actuated Finger with Selective Locking Chain Link Joints]()

Rigid robots excel in structured conditions, but struggle in more unpredictable or populated environments. Soft robots address these difficulties, but the compliance which gives them their inherent safety also limits their ability to apply desired forces. Jamming/locking reduces this back-drivability but does not allow for directional application of force. We present a hybrid system including pneumatic and tendon actuation as well as a system of cable-driven locking modules, able lock individual joints. Combining these mechanisms yields a device which can behave as: a soft finger, a fully-rigid finger, and a locally-locking finger which mimics a traditional rigid-link robot. This finger is able to switch between these behaviors on-the-fly, allowing it to adapt to unexpected scenarios, critical for social robots. Using these modes and the ability to adapt real-time, our finger is able to complete common household tasks, difficult for current robots. We characterize the finger’s ability to resist force in three actuation modes (Pneumatic, Cable, and Locked), its ability to apply force, and its ability to actuate in 31 different configurations (plus a static all-locked configuration). We also present a demonstration in which the finger conforms to the shape of a computer mouse then clicks a mouse button, and of the finger conforms to the shape of a heavy door handle, then pulling it open. We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of this finger as a demonstration of the underlying concept, which can be broadly applied to social robotics.

### [Enabling Framework for Constant Complexity Model in Autonomous Inter-Reconfigurable Robots (I)]()

In reconfigurable robotics, intra-reconfiguration enables a robot to change its functional abilities, while inter-reconfiguration manipulates the specification limits of the robot hardware. Although the versatility of inter-reconfigurable robots is desired in advanced autonomous systems, the O(n^3) algorithm computational time complexity challenge comes when multiple modular robots combine and reconfigure into a bigger form structure for autonomous navigation tasks. This phenomenon has limited the inter-reconfiguration potential of expansion, versatility, and robustness. In this paper, a navigation framework with non-complex transformation states is proposed for inter-reconfigurable robots to perform combining and splitting control dimensions. Simulations have shown the complexity from	O(n) to constant time O(1) in the reconfiguration states of the framework on a considerable number of robot agents. Additionally, a set of inter-reconfigurable robots, Wasp Biggie, was used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept in experiments as a fully functional centralized planner system. These experiments showed outperforming results on the consistent utility of CPU consumption while performing navigation and reconfiguration.

### [Improving Coverage Performance of a Size-Reconfigurable Robot Based on Overlapping and Reconfiguration Reduction Criteria]()

Size reconfigurable robots have been introduced for coverage applications to improve performance. The size reconfiguration ability allows a robot to access narrow areas in a smaller size while covering open spaces in a larger size, improving productivity. This paper proposes a novel CPP method consisting of an Overlapping Reduction Criterion (ORC) and a Reconfiguration Reduction Criterion (RRC) for a size-reconfigurable robot to improve performance in dynamic workspaces. A Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) is adapted to guide the robot toward unvisited cells considering neural activity variation. The size variation is managed by utilizing a collection of grid maps generated for various size configurations of the robot. The RRC and ORC penalize the movements requiring size reconfigurations or creating isolated unvisited regions in the decision-making process of next movement selection yielding to reduce reconfigurations and overlapping. According to the results, the proposed CPP method surpasses state of the art in terms of performance indexes reconfiguration count, overlapping, path distance, and coverage time by significant margins.

### [Loopy Movements: Emergence of Rotation in a Multicellular Robot]()

Unlike most human-engineered systems, many biological systems rely on emergent behaviors from low-level interactions, enabling greater diversity and superior adaptation to complex, dynamic environments. This study explores emergent decentralized rotation in the Loopy multicellular robot, composed of homogeneous, physically linked, 1-degree-of-freedom cells. Inspired by biological systems like sunflowers, Loopy uses simple local interactions—diffusion, reaction, and active transport of simulated chemicals, called morphogens—without centralized control or knowledge of its global morphology. Through these interactions, the robot self-organizes to achieve coordinated rotational motion and forms lobes—local protrusions created by clusters of motor cells. This study investigates how these interactions drive Loopy’s rotation, the impact of its morphology, and its resilience to actuator failures. Our findings reveal two distinct behaviors: 1) inner valleys between lobes rotate faster than the outer peaks, contrasting with rigid body dynamics, and 2) cells rotate in the opposite direction of the overall morphology. The experiments show that while Loopy’s morphology does not affect its angular velocity relative to its cells, larger lobes increase cellular rotation and decrease morphology rotation relative to the environment. Even with up to one-third of its actuators disabled and significant morphological changes, Loopy maintains its rotational abilities, highlighting the potential of decentralized, bio-inspired strategies for resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

### [Enhancing Connection Strength in Freeform Modular Reconfigurable Robots through Holey Sphere and Gripper Mechanisms]()

Freeform modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) systems overcome traditional docking limitations, enabling rapid and continuous connections between modules in any direction. Recent advancements in freeform MSRR technology have significantly enhanced connectivity and mobility. However, limitations in connector strength and operational efficiency in existing designs restrict performance. This paper proposes a rigid freeform connector and a rigid magnetic track design to improve the connection and motion performance of the SnailBot. Each SnailBot is equipped with a multi-channel rope-driven gripper, a metal spherical shell with densely distributed circular holes on the back, and a rigid chain design conforming to the spherical surface. This combination allows each SnailBot to move precisely along the surface of a peer, facilitated by the ferromagnetic spherical shell and magnetic track. The integration of the gripper and spherical shell hole array provides robust inter-module connections in any position and orientation. The effectiveness of these designs has been validated through a series of experiments and analyses, demonstrating improved connection and motion performance in the SnailBot dual-mode connector system and expanding its potential applications and functional capabilities.

### [Learning Dexterous Bimanual Catch Skills through Adversarial-Cooperative Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning]()

Robotic catching has traditionally focused on single-handed systems, which are limited in their ability to handle larger or more complex objects. In contrast, bimanual catching offers significant potential for improved dexterity and object handling but introduces new challenges in coordination and control. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning dexterous bimanual catching skills using Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL). Our approach introduces an adversarial reward scheme, where a throw agent increases the difficulty of throws adjusting speed while a catch agent learns to coordinate both hands to catch objects under these evolving conditions. We evaluate the framework in simulated environments using 15 different objects, demonstrating robustness and versatility in handling diverse objects. Our method achieved approximately a 2x increase in catching reward compared to single-agent baselines across 15 diverse objects.

### [Flat'n'Fold: A Diverse Multi-Modal Dataset for Garment Perception and Manipulation]()

We present Flat'n'Fold, a novel large-scale dataset for garment manipulation that addresses critical gaps in existing datasets. Comprising 1,212 human and 887 robot demonstrations of flattening and folding 44 unique garments across 8 categories, Flat'n'Fold surpasses prior datasets in size, scope, and diversity. Our dataset uniquely captures the entire manipulation process from crumpled to folded states, providing synchronized multi-view RGB-D images, point clouds, and action data, including hand or gripper positions and rotations. We quantify the dataset's diversity and complexity compared to existing benchmarks and show that our dataset features natural and diverse manipulations of real-world demonstrations of human and robot demonstrations in terms of visual and action information. To showcase Flat'n'Fold utility, we establish new benchmarks for grasping point prediction and subtask decomposition. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models on these tasks reveals significant room for improvement. This underscores Flat'n'Fold's potential to drive advances in robotic perception and manipulation of deformable objects. Our dataset can be downloaded at https://cvas-ug.github.io/flat-n-fold

### [TWIN: Two-Handed Intelligent Benchmark for Bimanual Manipulation]()

Bimanual manipulation is challenging due to precise spatial and temporal coordination required between two arms. While there exist several real-world bimanual systems, there is a lack of simulated benchmarks with a large task diversity for systematically studying bimanual capabilities across a wide range of tabletop tasks. This paper addresses the gap by presenting a benchmark for bimanual manipulation. A key functionality is the ability to autonomously generate training data without the necessity of human demonstrations to the robot. We open-source our code and benchmark, which comprises 13 new tasks with 23 unique task variations, each requiring a high degree of coordination and adaptability. To initiate the benchmark, we extended multiple state-of-the-art techniques to the domain of bimanual manipulation. The project website with code is available at: http://bimanual.github.io.

### [Active Vision Might Be All You Need: Exploring Active Vision in Bimanual Robotic Manipulation]()

Imitation learning has demonstrated significant potential in performing high-precision manipulation tasks using visual feedback. However, it is common practice in imitation learning for cameras to be fixed in place, resulting in issues like occlusion and limited field of view. Furthermore, cameras are often placed in broad, general locations, without an effective viewpoint specific to the robot's task. In this work, we investigate the utility of active vision (AV) for imitation learning and manipulation, in which, in addition to the manipulation policy, the robot learns an AV policy from human demonstrations to dynamically change the robot's camera viewpoint to obtain better information about its environment and the given task. We introduce AV-ALOHA, a new bimanual teleoperation robot system with AV, an extension of the ALOHA 2 robot system, incorporating an additional 7-DoF robot arm that only carries a stereo camera and is solely tasked with finding the best viewpoint. This camera streams stereo video to an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing the operator to control the camera pose using head and body movements. The system provides an immersive teleoperation experience, with bimanual first-person control, enabling the operator to dynamically explore and search the scene and simultaneously interact with the environment. We conduct imitation learning experiments of our system both in real-world and in simulation, across a variety of tasks that emphasize viewpoint planning. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of human-guided AV for imitation learning, showing significant improvements over fixed cameras in tasks with limited visibility.

### [Force-Conditioned Diffusion Policies for Compliant Sheet Separation Tasks in Bimanual Robotic Cells]()

Disassembly is a critical challenge in maintenance and service tasks, particularly in high-precision operations such as electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling. Tasks like prying-open sealed battery covers require precise manipulation and controlled force application. In our approach we collect human demonstrations using a motion capture system, enabling the robot to learn from human-expert disassembly strategies. These demonstrations train a bimanual robotic system in which one arm exerts force with a specialized tool while the other manipulates and removes sealed components. Our method builds on a diffusion-based policy and integrates real-time force sensing to adapt its actions as contact conditions change. We decompose the demonstrations into distinct sub-tasks and apply data augmentation, thereby reducing the number of demonstrations needed and mitigating potential task failures. Our results show that the proposed method, even with a small dataset, achieves a high task success rate and efficiency compared to a standard diffusion technique. We demonstrate in a real-world application that the bimanual system effectively executes chiseling and peeling actions to separate bonded sheet from a substrate.

### [A Comparison of Imitation Learning Algorithms for Bimanual Manipulation]()

Amidst the wide popularity of imitation learning algorithms in robotics, their properties regarding hyperparameter sensitivity, ease of training, data efficiency, and performance have not been well-studied in high-precision industry-inspired environments. In this work, we demonstrate the limitations and benefits of prominent imitation learning approaches and analyze their capabilities regarding these properties. We evaluate each algorithm on a complex bimanual manipulation task involving an over-constrained dynamics system in a setting involving multiple contacts between the manipulated object and the environment. While we find that imitation learning is well suited to solve such complex tasks, not all algorithms are equal in terms of handling environmental and hyperparameter perturbations, training requirements, performance, and ease of use. We investigate the empirical influence of these key characteristics by employing a carefully designed experimental procedure and learning environment.

### [Trajectory Optimization for Dynamically Grasping Irregular Objects]()

This paper presents a novel trajectory optimization framework for grasping a thin object with the schunk (SDH2) hand-mounted on a Kuka robot. Unlike a conventional grasping task, we aim to achieve a ``dynamic grasp'' of the object, which requires continuous movement during the grasping process. The trajectory framework comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of SI{10}{second}, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real time within 100 milliseconds. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. Simulation and experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of the trajectory planning framework in real-world scenarios.

### [DistillGrasp: Integrating Features Correlation with Knowledge Distillation for Depth Completion of Transparent Objects]()

Due to the visual properties of reflection and refraction, RGB-D cameras cannot accurately capture the depth of transparent objects, leading to incomplete depth maps. To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to explore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the depth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the correlation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we propose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which distillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Specifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block (PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the corresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence between two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student branch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains the reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the consistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth completion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from the teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the distance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a higher speed of 48 FPS. In addition, the significant improvement in a real-world robotic grasping system illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed system.

### [Real-Time Grasp Quality in Boundary-Constrained Granular Swarm Robots]()

Soft robotic grippers offer advantages over rigid end effectors but are typically coupled to a rigid robot for locomotion. In contrast, this paper details a soft robot for both locomotion and grasping. The system is a type of boundary- constrained granular swarm robot, which is composed of a closed-loop series of active (capable of locomotion) sub-robots. Prior work has shown how this type of robot is capable of loco- motion and grasping. For this paper, we propose a new grasping strategy and demonstrate real-time grasp quality evaluation using pressure sensors and the Ferrari-Canny grasp metric. The grasping strategy leverages gradient-based control via distance functions and dynamic system planning to achieve desired robot geometries for effective grasping. Previous research primarily used pull tests to evaluate grasping efficacy, which lacked real- time feedback on grasp quality. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this method.

### [Learning Dual-Arm Coordination for Grasping Large Flat Objects]()

Grasping large flat objects, such as books or keyboards lying horizontally, presents significant challenges for single-arm robotic systems, often requiring extra actions like pushing objects against walls or moving them to the edge of a surface to facilitate grasping. In contrast, dual-arm manipulation, inspired by human dexterity, offers a more refined solution by directly coordinating both arms to lift and grasp the object without the need for complex repositioning. In this paper, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable dual-arm coordination for grasping large flat objects. We utilize a large scale grasp pose detection model as a backbone to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then used as the state representation in a reinforcement learning (RL) model. A CNN-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with shared Actor-Critic layers is employed to learn coordinated dual-arm grasp actions. The system is trained and tested in Isaac Gym and deployed to real robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our policy can effectively grasp large flat objects without requiring additional maneuvers. Furthermore, the policy exhibits strong generalization capabilities, successfully handling unseen objects. Importantly, it can be directly transferred to real robots without fine-tuning, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

### [QDGset: A Large Scale Grasping Dataset Generated with Quality-Diversity]()

Recent advances in AI have led to significant results in robotic learning, but skills like grasping remain partially solved. Many recent works exploit synthetic grasping datasets to learn to grasp unknown objects. However, those datasets were generated using simple grasp sampling methods using priors. Recently, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proven to make grasp sampling significantly more efficient. In this work, we extend QDG-6DoF, a QD framework for generating object-centric grasps, to scale up the production of synthetic grasping datasets. We propose a data augmentation method that combines the transformation of object meshes with transfer learning from previous grasping repertoires. The conducted experiments show that this approach reduces the number of required evaluations per discovered robust grasp by up to 20%. We used this approach to generate QDGset, a dataset of 6DoF grasp poses that contains about 3.5 and 4.5 times more grasps and objects, respectively, than the previous state-of-the-art. Our method allows anyone to easily generate data, eventually contributing to a large-scale collaborative dataset of synthetic grasps.

### [Patch Tree: Exploiting the Gauss Map and Principal Component Analysis for Robotic Grasping]()

Grasp planning must consider an object's local geometry (at the finger contacts), for the range of applicable wrenches under friction, and its global geometry, for force closure and grasp quality. Most everyday objects have curved surfaces unamenable to a pure combinatorial approach but treatable with tools from differential geometry. Our idea is to ``discretize'' such a surface in a top-down fashion into elementary patches (e-patches), each consisting of points that would yield close enough wrenches. Preprocessing based on Gaussian curvature decomposes the surface into strictly convex, strictly concave, ruled, and saddle patches. The Gauss map guides the subdivision of any patch with a large variation in the contact force direction, with the aid of a Platonic solid. The principal component analysis (PCA) further subdivides any patch that has a large variation in torque. The final structure is called a {it patch tree}, which stores e-patches at its leaves, and force or torque ranges at its internal nodes. Grasp synthesis and optimization operates on the patch tree with a stack to efficiently prune away non-promising finger placements. Simulation and experiment with a Shadow Hand have been conducted over everyday items. The patch tree exhibits different levels of surface granularity. It has a good promise for efficient planning of finger gaits to carry out grasping and tool manipulation.

### [Improved Bag-Of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for Ground Texture Localization]()

Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate k -means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.

### [Improving Indoor Localization Accuracy by Using an Efficient Implicit Neural Map Representation]()

Globally localizing a mobile robot in a known map is often a foundation for enabling robots to navigate and operate autonomously. In indoor environments, traditional Monte Carlo localization based on occupancy grid maps is considered the gold standard, but its accuracy is limited by the representation capabilities of the occupancy grid map. In this paper, we address the problem of building an effective map representation that allows to accurately perform probabilistic global localization. To this end, we propose an implicit neural map representation that is able to capture positional and directional geometric features from 2D LiDAR scans to efficiently represent the environment and learn a neural network that is able to predict both, the non-projective signed distance and a direction-aware projective distance for an arbitrary point in the mapped environment. This combination of neural map representation with a light-weight neural network allows us to design an efficient observation model within a conventional Monte Carlo localization framework for pose estimation of a robot in real time. We evaluated our approach to indoor localization on a publicly available dataset for global localization and the experimental results indicate that our approach is able to more accurately localize a mobile robot than other localization approaches employing occupancy or existing neural map representations. In contrast to other approaches employing an implicit neural map representation for 2D LiDAR localization, our approach allows to perform real-time pose tracking after convergence and near real-time global localization. The code of our approach is available at: url{https://github.com/PRBonn/enm-mcl}.

### [Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles]()

The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs. highway, dynamic vs. static scenes, winter vs. summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.

### [LiLoc: Lifelong Localization Using Adaptive Submap Joining and Egocentric Factor Graph]()

This paper proposes a versatile graph-based lifelong localization framework, LiLoc, which enhances its timeliness by maintaining a single central session while improves the accuracy through multi-modal factors between the central and subsidiary sessions. First, an adaptive submap joining strategy is employed to generate prior submaps (keyframes and poses) for the central session, and to provide priors for subsidiaries when constraints are needed for robust localization. Next, a coarse-to-fine pose initialization for subsidiary sessions is performed using vertical recognition and ICP refinement in the global coordinate frame. To elevate the accuracy of subsequent localization, we propose an egocentric factor graph (EFG) module that integrates the IMU preintegration, LiDAR odometry and scan match factors in a joint optimization manner. Specifically, the scan match factors are constructed by a novel propagation model that efficiently distributes the prior constrains as edges to the relevant prior pose nodes, weighted by noises based on keyframe registration errors. Additionally, the framework supports flexible switching between two modes: relocalization (RLM) and incremental localization (ILM) based on the proposed overlap-based mechanism to select or update the prior submaps from central session. The proposed LiLoc is tested on public and custom datasets, demonstrating accurate localization performance against state-of-the-art methods. Our codes will be publicly available on https://github.com/Yixin-F/LiLoc.

### [ReFeree: Radar-Based Lightweight and Robust Localization Using Feature and Free Space]()

Place recognition plays an important role in achieving robust long-term autonomy. Real-world robots face a wide range of weather conditions (e.g. overcast, heavy rain, and snowing) and most sensors (i.e. camera, LiDAR) essentially functioning within or near-visible electromagnetic waves are sensitive to adverse weather conditions,making reliable localization difficult. In contrast, radar is gaining traction due to long electromagnetic waves, which are less affected by environmental changes and weather independence. In this work, we propose a radar-based lightweight and robust place recognition. We achieve rotational invariance and lightweight by selecting a one-dimensional ring-shaped description and robustness by mitigating the impact of false detection utilizing opposite noise characteristics between free space and feature. In addition, the initial heading can be estimated, which can assist in building a SLAM pipeline that combines odometry and registration, which takes into account onboard computing. The proposed method was tested for rigorous validation across various scenarios (i.e. single session, multi-session, and different weather conditions). In particular, we validate our descriptor achieving reliable place recognition performance through the results of extreme environments that lacked structural information such as an OORD dataset.

### [On the Consistency of Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization: A Transformation-Based Approach]()

This paper investigates the inconsistency problem caused by the mismatch of observability properties commonly found in multi-robot cooperative localization (CL) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). To address this issue, we propose a transformation-based approach that introduces a linear time-varying transformation to ensure the transformed system possesses a state-independent unobservable subspace. Consequently, its observability properties remain unaffected by the linearization points. We establish the relationship between the unobservable subspaces of the original and transformed systems, guiding the design of the time-varying transformation. We then present a novel estimator based on this method, referred to as the Transformed EKF (T-EKF), which utilizes the transformed system for state estimation, thereby ensuring correct observability and thus consistency. The proposed approach has been extensively validated through both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating better performance in terms of both accuracy and consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [Chemistry3D: Robotic Interaction Toolkit for Chemistry Experiments]()

The advent of simulation engines has revolutionized learning and operational efficiency for robots, offering cost-effective and swift pipelines. However, the lack of a universal simulation platform tailored for chemical scenarios impedes progress in robotic manipulation and visualization of reaction processes. Addressing this void, we present Chemistry3D, an innovative toolkit that integrates extensive chemical and robotic knowledge. Chemistry3D not only enables robots to perform chemical experiments but also provides real-time visualization of temperature, color, and pH changes during reactions. Built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, Chemistry3D offers interfaces for robot operation, visual inspection, and liquid flow control, facilitating the simulation of special objects such as liquids and transparent entities. Leveraging this toolkit, we have devised RL tasks, object detection, and robot operation scenarios. Additionally, to discern disparities between the rendering engine and the real world, we conducted transparent object detection experiments using Sim2Real, validating the toolkit's exceptional simulation performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/huangyan28/Chemistry3D, and a related tutorial can be found at https://www.omni-chemistry.com.

### [Introducing KUGE: A Simultaneous Control Co-Design Architecture and Its Application to Aerial Robotics Development]()

The increasing complexity of tasks performed by hybrid aerial robotic systems, such as tail-sitters, demands a more integrated approach to their design. Traditional sequential design methods fall short because they separate the control system design from the conceptual design, limiting the potential for discovering coupled solutions. This disjointed process constrains the design space, making it difficult to optimize both the control performance and system dynamics simultaneously. In response to this limitation, there has been growing interest in mission-specific dynamic design procedures, which aim to address specific operational challenges by integrating control and design early in the development process. The multi-disciplinary approach of control co-design (CCD) expands the design space by solving control and system design problems concurrently. The recently introduced DAIMYO framework demonstrated that combining multi-fidelity modelling with a nested CCD approach can tackle the sim-to-real gap. However, DAIMYO’s reliance on Bayesian optimization to account for the computational cost increase of a nested formulation limits its scalability. To address these issues, we propose KUGE, a simultaneous CCD strategy that reduces computational complexity and overcomes dimensionality restrictions through a combined effort of stochastic optimization and Gaussian processes. We validate the effectiveness of KUGE by applying it to the dynamic design of a tail-sitter, showing that it is competitive with the DAIMYO architecture while offering greater computational efficiency.

### [HEROES: Unreal Engine-Based Human and Emergency Robot Operation Education System]()

Training and preparing first responders and humanitarian robots for Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) often poses a challenge owing to the lack of realistic and easily accessible test facilities. While such facilities can offer realistic scenarios post an MCI that can serve training and educational purposes for first responders and humanitarian robots, they are often hard to access owing to logistical constraints. To overcome this challenge, we present HEROES- a versatile Unreal Engine-based simulator for designing novel training simulations for humans and emergency robots for such urban search and rescue operations. The proposed HEROES simulator is capable of generating synthetic datasets for machine learning pipelines that are used for training robot navigation. This work addresses the necessity for a comprehensive training platform in the robotics community, ensuring pragmatic and efficient preparation for real-world emergency scenarios. The strengths of our simulator lie in its adaptability, scalability, and ability to facilitate collaboration between robot developers and first responders, fostering synergy in developing effective strategies for search and rescue operations in MCIs. We conducted a preliminary user study with an average score of 8.1 out of 10 supporting the ability of HEROES to generate sufficiently varied environments and a score of 7.8 out of 10 affirming the usefulness of the simulation environment. HEROES has been integrated with ROS and has been used to train an RL model for a real robot as a proof of concept.

### [On the Necessity of Real-Time Principles in GPU-Driven Autonomous Robots]()

Robot autonomy is driving an ever-increasing demand for computational power, including on-board multi-core CPUs and accelerators such as GPUs, to enable fast perception, planning, control, and more. Careful scheduling of these computational tasks on the CPU cores and GPUs is important to prevent locking up the finite computational capacity in ways that hinder other critical workloads; delays in computing time-critical tasks like obstacle detection and control can have huge negative consequences for autonomous robots, potentially resulting in damage, substantial financial loss, or even loss of life. In this paper, we leverage recent advances from real-time systems research. We apply TimeWall, a component-based real-time framework, to the computational components of an autonomous drone and experimentally show that the timeliness and safe operation properties of a drone are preserved even in the presence of increasing interfering computational processes.

### [HPRM: High-Performance Robotic Middleware for Intelligent Autonomous Systems]()

The rise of intelligent autonomous systems, especially in robotics and autonomous agents, has created a critical need for robust communication middleware that can ensure real-time processing of extensive sensor data. Current robotics middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 faces challenges with nondeterminism and high communication latency when dealing with large data across multiple subscribers on a multi-core compute platform. To address these issues, we present High-Performance Robotic Middleware (HPRM), built on top of the deterministic coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). HPRM employs optimizations including an in-memory object store for efficient zero-copy transfer of large payloads, adaptive serialization to minimize serialization overhead, and an eager protocol with real-time sockets to reduce handshake latency. Benchmarks show HPRM achieves up to 114x lower latency than ROS2 when broadcasting large messages to multiple nodes. We then demonstrate the benefits of HPRM by integrating it with the CARLA simulator and running reinforcement learning agents along with object detection workloads. In the CARLA autonomous driving application, HPRM attains 91.1% lower latency than ROS2. The deterministic coordination semantics of HPRM, combined with its optimized IPC mechanisms, enable efficient and predictable real-time communication for intelligent autonomous systems. Code and videos can be found on our project page: https://hprm-robotics.github.io/HPRM

### [CusADi: A GPU Parallelization Framework for Symbolic Expressions and Optimal Control]()

The parallelism afforded by GPUs presents significant advantages in training controllers through reinforcement learning (RL). However, integrating model-based optimization into this process remains challenging due to the complexity of formulating and solving optimization problems across thousands of instances. In this work, we present CusADi, an extension of the CasADi symbolic framework to support the parallelization of arbitrary closed-form expressions on GPUs with CUDA. We also formulate a closed-form approximation for solving general optimal control problems, enabling large-scale parallelization and evaluation of MPC controllers. Our results show a ten-fold speedup relative to similar MPC implementation on the CPU, and we demonstrate the use of CusADi for various applications, including parallel simulation, parameter sweeps, and policy training.

### [Learning Optimal Design Manifolds to Design More Practical Robotic Systems]()

This paper introduces the optimal design manifold as a novel approach for understanding and optimizing the design of robotic systems. Existing optimization frameworks often jointly optimize design and behavior but lack insight into why specific designs are optimal for given tasks. Additionally, a functionally optimal design may not always be the most practical to build and practicality cannot always be captured by an objective function. By defining and learning the optimal design manifold, which represents the space of all optimal solutions, we provide a systematic method for exploring the design space and selecting the most practical optimal design. We apply the optimal design manifold to robot cell layout optimization, robot design optimization, and multi-camera placement and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing design choices by enabling a deeper understanding of what makes a design optimal.

### [Monotone Subsystem Decomposition for Efficient Multi-Objective Robot Design]()

Automating design minimizes errors, accelerates the design process, and reduces cost. However, automating robot design is challenging due to recursive constraints, multiple design objectives, and cross-domain design complexity possibly spanning multiple abstraction layers. Here we look at the problem of component selection, a combinatorial optimization problem in which a designer, given a robot model, must select compatible components from an extensive catalog. The goal is to satisfy high-level task specifications while optimally balancing trade-offs between competing design objectives. In this paper, we extend our previous constraint programming approach to multi-objective design problems and propose the novel technique of monotone subsystem decomposition to efficiently compute a Pareto front of solutions for large-scale problems. We prove that subsystems can be optimized for their Pareto fronts and, under certain conditions, these results can be used to determine a globally optimal Pareto front. Furthermore, subsystems serve as an intuitive design abstraction and can be reused across various design problems. Using an example quadcopter design problem, we compare our method to a linear programming approach and demonstrate our method scales better for large catalogs, solving a multi-objective problem of 10^25 component combinations in seconds. We then expand the original problem and solve a task-oriented, multi-objective design problem to build a fleet of quadcopters to deliver packages. We compute a Pareto front of solutions in seconds where each solution contains an optimal component-level design and an optimal package delivery schedule for each quadcopter.

### [Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing]()

Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at github.com/ETH-PBL/elmap-rl-controller.

### [AeroSafe: Mobile Indoor Air Purification Using Aerosol Residence Time Analysis and Robotic Cough Emulator Testbed]()

Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a manoeuvrable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.

### [Remote Inspection Techniques: A Review of Autonomous Robotic Inspection for Marine Vessels (I)]()

Due to the harsh environment and heavy use that modern marine vessels are subjected to, they are required to undergo periodic inspections to determine their current condition. The use of autonomous remote inspection systems can alleviate some of the dangers and shortcomings associated with manual inspection. While there has been research on the use of robotic platforms, none of the works in the literature evaluates the current state of the art with respect to the specifications of the classification societies, who are the most important stakeholders among the end users. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing literature and evaluate the works individually in collaboration with classification societies. The papers included in this review are either directly developed for, or have properties potentially transferable to, the marine vessel inspection process. To structure the review, an expertise-engineering separation is proposed based on the contributions of the individual paper. This separation shows which part of the inspection process has received the most attention, as well as where the shortcomings of each approach lay. The findings indicate that while there are promising approaches, there is still a gap between the classification societies’ requirements and the state of the art. Our results indicate that, there is quality work in the literature, but there is a lack of integrated development activities that achieve sufficient completeness.

### [Toward Fully Automated Aviation: PIBOT, a Humanoid Robot Pilot, for Human-Centric Aircraft Cockpits]()

Humanoid robots have been considered ideal for automating daily tasks, though most research has centered on bipedal locomotion. Many activities we do routinely, such as driving a car, require real-time system manipulation as well as substantial field-specific knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are empowering humanoid robots to access and process vast information sources and operate systems with an unprecedented level of autonomy. This article introduces PIBOT, a humanoid robot that can pilot unmodified general aviation (GA) aircraft, physically manipulating instruments while following strict rules of the air and verbally communicating with copilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs). Building on these capabilities, we developed an LLM-based task planner that interprets natural language commands, translating them into action sequences. Then, the behavior decision module breaks tasks into precise limb movements, enabling humanlike control of cockpit instruments. In a series of rigorous simulations, PIBOT demonstrates its capabilities to successfully take off and land an airplane from a cold-and-dark start, showcasing its potential for a fully autonomous robot pilot.

### [Sampling-Based Grasp and Collision Prediction for Assisted Teleoperation]()

Shared autonomy allows for combining the global planning capabilities of a human operator with the strengths of a robot such as repeatability and accurate control. In a real-time teleoperation setting, one possibility for shared autonomy is to let the human operator decide for the rough movement and to let the robot do fine adjustments, e.g., when the view of the operator is occluded. We present a learning-based concept for shared autonomy that aims at supporting the human operator in a real-time teleoperation setting. At every step, our system tracks the target pose set by the human operator as accurately as possible while at the same time satisfying a set of constraints which influence the robot’s behavior. An important characteristic is that the constraints can be dynamically activated and deactivated which allows the system to provide task-specific assistance. Since the system must generate robot commands in real-time, solving an optimization problem in every iteration is not feasible. Instead, we sample potential target configurations and use Neural Networks for predicting the constraint costs for each configuration. By evaluating each configuration in parallel, our system is able to select the target configuration which satisfies the constraints and has the minimum distance to the operator’s target pose with minimal delay. We evaluate the framework with a pick and place task on a bi-manual setup with two Franka Emika Panda robot arms with Robotiq grippers.

### [Inverse Mixed Strategy Games with Generative Trajectory Models]()

Game-theoretic models are effective tools for modeling multi-agent interactions, especially when robots need to coordinate with humans. However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors---a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.

### [AToM: Adaptive Theory-Of-Mind-Based Human Motion Prediction in Long-Term Human-Robot Interactions]()

Humans learn from observations and experiences to adjust their behaviours towards better performance. Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others’ behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning. Code will be available at https://github.com/centiLinda/AToM-human-prediction.git.

### [Learning Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Planning in Crowd Navigation]()

Robot navigation in dense human crowds poses a significant challenge due to the complexity of human behavior in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. In this work, we propose a dynamic weight adjustment scheme using a neural network to predict the optimal weights of objectives in an optimization-based motion planner. We adopt a spatial-temporal trajectory planner and incorporate diverse objectives to achieve a balance among safety, efficiency, and goal achievement in complex and dynamic environments. We design the network structure, observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.

### [COLLAGE: COLLAborative Human-Agent Interaction Generation Using Hierarchical Latent Diffusion and Language Models]()

We propose a novel framework COLLAGE for generating collaborative agent-object-agent interactions by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and hierarchical motion-specific vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a generative diffusion model. The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction, avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling complex interactions in various domains, such as robotics, graphics and computer vision.

### [Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction Using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs]()

We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.

### [LUMOS: Language-Conditioned Imitation Learning with World Models]()

We introduce LUMOS, a language-conditioned multi-task imitation learning framework for robotics. LUMOS learns skills by practicing them over many long-horizon rollouts in the latent space of a learned world model and transfers these skills zero-shot to a real robot. By learning on-policy in the latent space of the learned world model, our algorithm mitigates policy-induced distribution shift which most offline imitation learning methods suffer from. LUMOS learns from unstructured play data with fewer than 1% hindsight language annotations but is steerable with language commands at test time. We achieve this coherent long-horizon performance by combining latent planning with both image- and language-based hindsight goal relabeling during training, and by optimizing an intrinsic reward defined in the latent space of the world model over multiple time steps, effectively reducing covariate shift. In experiments on the difficult long-horizon CALVIN benchmark, LUMOS outperforms prior learning-based methods with comparable approaches on chained multi-task evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn a language-conditioned continuous visuomotor control for a real-world robot within an offline world model. Videos, dataset and code are available at http://lumos.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [LIMT: Language-Informed Multi-Task Visual World Models]()

Most recent successes in robot reinforcement learning involve learning a specialized single-task agent. However, robots capable of performing multiple tasks can be much more valuable in real-world applications. Multi-task reinforcement learning can be very challenging due to the increased sample complexity and the potentially conflicting task objectives. Previous work on this topic is dominated by model-free approaches. The latter can be very sample inefficient even when learning specialized single-task agents. In this work, we focus on model-based multi-task reinforcement learning. We propose a method for learning multi-task visual world models, leveraging pre-trained language models to extract semantically meaningful task representations. These representations are used by the world model and policy to reason about task similarity in dynamics and behavior. Our results highlight the benefits of using language-driven task representations for world models and a clear advantage of model-based multi-task learning over the more common model-free paradigm.

### [Towards Robust Autonomous Driving: Conditional Multimodal Large Language Models for Fine-Grained Perception]()

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various visual understanding tasks. However, most existing MLLMs still lack image detail perception, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require detailed visual information. In this paper, we introduce Percept-DriveLM, a novel MLLM designed to tackle the fine-grained perception challenges in autonomous driving tasks. At the core of our model is the Visual Fusion Module, which integrates several innovative components: a dynamic resolution mechanism that combines both high and low resolution features, and an RoI conditional mechanism to incorporate object/region-level features identified by offline detectors, further refining the model's fine-grained perception abilities. Trained in a two-stage process, our model demonstrates exceptional performance, outperforming existing MLLMs with comparable parameter sizes and excelling in both autonomous driving perception and general vision-language tasks. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive empirical studies. Code will be available at https://github.com/DebuggerSunfz/PerceptDriveLM.

### [Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling Via Large Language Models for Robotic Skill Learning]()

Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy optimization is inefficient and limits the robot’s learning performance. To address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner. Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.

### [RT-Affordance: Affordances Are Versatile Intermediate Representations for Robot Manipulation]()

We explore how intermediate policy representations can facilitate generalization by providing guidance on how to perform manipulation tasks. Existing representations such as language, goal images, and trajectory sketches have been shown to be helpful, but these representations either do not provide enough context or provide over-specified context that yields less robust policies. We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the pose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet lightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate efficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our method, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an affordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this affordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge heterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot trajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain affordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any additional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks how RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and we empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.

### [A Real-To-Sim-To-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards]()

Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.

### [Learning Task Specifications from Demonstrations As Probabilistic Automata]()

Specifying tasks for robotic systems traditionally requires coding expertise, deep domain knowledge, and significant time investment. While learning from demonstration offers a promising alternative, existing methods often struggle with tasks of longer horizons. To address this limitation, we introduce a computationally efficient approach for learning probabilistic deterministic finite automata (PDFA) that capture task structures and expert preferences directly from demonstrations. Our approach infers sub-goals and their temporal dependencies, producing an interpretable task specification that domain experts can easily understand and adjust. We validate our method through experiments involving object manipulation tasks, showcasing how our method enables a robot arm to effectively replicate diverse expert strategies while adapting to changing conditions.

### [Robot Utility Models: General Policies for Zero-Shot Deployment in New Environments]()

Robot models, particularly those trained with large amounts of data, have recently shown a plethora of real-world manipulation and navigation capabilities. Several independent efforts have shown that given sufficient training data in an environment, robot policies can generalize to demonstrated variations in that environment. However, needing to finetune robot models to every new environment stands in stark contrast to models in language or vision that can be deployed zero-shot for open-world problems. In this work, we present Robot Utility Models (RUMs), a framework for training and deploying zero-shot robot policies that can directly generalize to new environments without any finetuning. To create RUMs efficiently, we develop new tools to quickly collect data for mobile manipulation tasks, integrate such data into a policy with multi-modal imitation learning, and deploy policies on-device on Hello Robot Stretch, a cheap commodity robot, with an external mLLM verifier for retrying. We train five such utility models for opening cabinet doors, opening drawers, picking up napkins, picking up paper bags, and reorienting fallen objects. Our system, on average, achieves 90% success rate in unseen, novel environments interacting with unseen objects. Moreover, the utility models can also succeed in different robot and camera set-ups with no further data, training, or fine-tuning. Primary among our lessons are the importance of training data over training algorithm and policy class, guidance about data scaling, necessity for diverse yet high-quality demonstrations, and a recipe for robot introspection and retrying to improve performance on individual environments.

### [R+X: Retrieval and Execution from Everyday Human Videos]()

We present R+X, a framework which enables robots to learn skills from long, unlabelled, first-person videos of humans performing everyday tasks. Given a language command from a human, R+X first retrieves short video clips containing relevant behaviour, and then executes the skill by conditioning an in-context imitation learning method on this behaviour. By leveraging a Vision Language Model (VLM) for retrieval, R+X does not require any manual annotation of the videos, and by leveraging in-context learning for execution, robots can perform commanded skills immediately, without requiring a period of training on the retrieved videos. Experiments studying a range of everyday household tasks show that R+X succeeds at translating unlabelled human videos into robust robot skills, and that R+X outperforms several recent alternative methods. Appendix and videos are available at https://www.robot-learning.uk/r-plus-x.

### [ARCap: Collecting High-Quality Human Demonstrations for Robot Learning with Augmented Reality Feedback]()

Recent progress in imitation learning from human demonstrations has shown promising results in teaching robots manipulation skills. To further scale up training datasets, recent works start to use portable data collection devices without the need for physical robot hardware. However, due to the absence of on-robot feedback during data collection, the data quality depends heavily on user expertise, and many devices are limited to specific robot embodiments. We propose ARCap, a portable data collection system that provides visual feedback through augmented reality (AR) and haptic warnings to guide users in collecting high-quality demonstrations. Through extensive user studies, we show that ARCap enables novice users to collect robot-executable data that matches robot kinematics and avoids collisions with the scenes. With data collected from ARCap, robots can perform challenging tasks, such as manipulation in cluttered environments and long-horizon cross-embodiment manipulation. ARCap is fully open-source and easy to calibrate; all components are built from off-the-shelf products. More details can be found on our website: href{https://stanford-tml.github.io/ARCap}{stanford-tml.gi thub.io/ARCap}

### [XMoP: Whole-Body Control Policy for Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Neural Motion Planning]()

Classical manipulator motion planners work across different robot embodiments. However they plan on a pre-specified static environment representation, and are not scalable to unseen dynamic environments. Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and zero-shot transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on 7 commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average 70% success rate on baseline benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate sim-to-real deployment on two unseen manipulators solving novel planning problems across three real-world domains even with dynamic obstacles.

### [KALM: Keypoint Abstraction Using Large Models for Object-Relative Imitation Learning]()

Generalization to novel object configurations and instances across diverse tasks and environments is a critical challenge in robotics. Keypoint-based representations have been proven effective as a succinct representation for capturing essential object features, and for establishing a reference frame in action prediction, enabling data-efficient learning of robot skills. However, their manual design nature and reliance on additional human labels limit their scalability. In this paper, we propose KALM, a framework that leverages large pre-trained vision-language models (LMs) to automatically generate task-relevant and cross-instance consistent keypoints. KALM distills robust and consistent keypoints across views and objects by generating proposals using LMs and verifies them against a small set of robot demonstration data. Based on the generated keypoints, we can train keypoint-conditioned policy models that predict actions in keypoint-centric frames, enabling robots to generalize effectively across varying object poses, camera views, and object instances with similar functional shapes. Our method demonstrates strong performance in the real world, adapting to different tasks and environments from only a handful of demonstrations while requiring no additional labels. Videos can be found at https://kalm-il.github.io/.

### [AutoSplat: Constrained Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving Scene Reconstruction]()

Realistic scene reconstruction and view synthesis are essential for advancing autonomous driving systems by simulating safety-critical scenarios. 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in real-time rendering and static scene reconstructions but struggles with modeling driving scenarios due to complex backgrounds, dynamic objects, and sparse camera views. We propose AutoSplat, a framework employing Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct autonomous driving scenes. By imposing geometric constraints on Gaussians representing the road and sky regions, our method enables multi-view consistent simulation of challenging scenarios, including lane changes. Leveraging 3D templates, we introduce a reflected Gaussian consistency constraint to supervise both the visible and unseen side of foreground objects. Moreover, to model the dynamic appearance of foreground objects, we estimate temporally-dependent residual spherical harmonics for each foreground Gaussian. Extensive experiments on Pandaset and KITTI demonstrate that AutoSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis across diverse driving scenarios. Our project page can be found here: https://autosplat.github.io/

### [Diffusion-Based Generative Models for 3D Occupancy Prediction in Autonomous Driving]()

Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our method for real-world autonomous driving applications.

### [Interactive4D: Interactive 4D LiDAR Segmentation]()

Interactive segmentation has an important role in facilitating the annotation process of future LiDAR datasets. Existing approaches sequentially segment individual objects at each LiDAR scan, repeating the process throughout the entire sequence, which is redundant and ineffective. In this work, we propose interactive 4D segmentation, a new paradigm that allows segmenting multiple objects on multiple LiDAR scans simultaneously, and Interactive4D, the first interactive 4D segmentation model that segments multiple objects on superimposed consecutive LiDAR scans in a single iteration by utilizing the sequential nature of LiDAR data. While performing interactive segmentation, our model leverages the entire space- time volume, leading to more efficient segmentation. Operating on the 4D volume, it directly provides consistent instance IDs over time and also simplifies tracking annotations. Moreover, we show that click simulations are crucial for successful model training on LiDAR point clouds. To this end, we design a click simulation strategy that is better suited for the char- acteristics of LiDAR data. To demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness, we evaluate Interactive4D on multiple LiDAR datasets, where Interactive4D achieves a new state-of-the-art by a large margin. We publicly release the code and models at https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/Interactive4D.

### [Robust Scene Change Detection Using Visual Foundation Models and Cross-Attention Mechanisms]()

We present a novel method for scene change detection that leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of a visual foundational model, DINOv2, and integrates full-image cross-attention to address key challenges such as varying lighting, seasonal variations, and viewpoint differences. In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) “freeze” the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ “full-image” cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method’s superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/ChadLin9596/Robust-Scene-Change-Detection.

### [LaB-CL: Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for Improving Parking Slot Detection]()

Parking slot detection is an essential technology in autonomous parking systems. In general, the classification problem of parking slot detection consists of two tasks, a task determining whether localized candidates are junctions of parking slots or not, and the other that identifies a shape of detected junctions. Both classification tasks can easily face biased learning toward the majority class, degrading classification performances. Yet, the data imbalance issue has been overlooked in parking slot detection. We propose the first supervised contrastive learning framework for parking slot detection, Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection (LaB-CL). The proposed LaB-CL framework uses two main approaches. First, we propose to include class prototypes to consider representations from all classes in every mini batch, from the local perspective. Second, we propose a new hard negative sampling scheme that selects local representations with high prediction error. Experiments with the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaB-CL framework can outperform existing parking slot detection methods.

### [LiCROcc: Teach Radar for Accurate Semantic Occupancy Prediction Using LiDAR and Camera]()

Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is pivotal in autonomous driving perception, frequently confronted with the complexities of weather and illumination changes. The long-term strategy involves fusing multi-modal information to bolster the system's robustness. Radar, increasingly utilized for 3D target detection, is gradually replacing LiDAR in autonomous driving applications, offering a robust sensing alternative. In this paper, we focus on the potential of 3D radar in semantic scene completion, pioneering cross-modal refinement techniques for improved robustness against weather and illumination changes and enhancing SSC performance. Regarding model architecture, we propose a three-stage tight fusion approach on BEV to realize a fusion framework for point clouds and images. Based on this foundation, we designed three cross-modal distillation modules—CMRD, BRD, and PDD. Our approach enhances the performance in radar-only (R-LiCROcc) and radar-camera (RC-LiCROcc) settings by distilling to them the rich semantic and structural information of the fused features of LiDAR and camera. Finally, our LC-Fusion, R-LiCROcc and RC-LiCROcc achieve the best performance on the nuScenes-Occupancy dataset, with mIOU exceeding the baseline by 22.9%, 44.1%, and 15.5%, respectively. The project page is available at url{https://hr-zju.github.io/LiCROcc/}.

### [ChicGrasp: Imitation-Learning Control for Dual-Finger Manipulation of Delicate, Irregular, and Bio-Products]()

The pick-and-rehang operation in poultry processing remains manual even with other advancements in automation. In this paper, we present ChicGrasp, an imitative-learning setup that enables a UR10e robot with an independently controlled dual-jaw pneumatic gripper to perform the process of picking up and rehanging chicken. A conditional denoising diffusion model is conditioned on 50 teleoperation demonstrations (RGB image, proprioception, and gripper state) to acquire continuous robot motion and discrete gripper movement; continuous jaw logits during runtime are thresholded to control an Arduino-actuated solenoid valve. Experimental trials demonstrate that the diffusion-based policy, together with our custom gripper, achieved a 40.6% grasp-and-lift success rate and took 38 seconds to complete the entire pick-to-shackle task (with 10 seconds for placement), while an Implicit Behavior Cloning baseline failed completely. In addition, a fixed seven-waypoint trajectory achieved 100% rehang consistency if picking was successful. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion policies, in conjunction with task-specific end-effectors, to handle fragile, non-regular objects in semi-real factory environments. Real-time force/torque sensing will be included in future work, and a motion capture teleoperation system will be used for the rehanging process. Moreover, other algorithms, such as LSTM-GMM and 3D diffusion policy will be investigated.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Scan Planning for Autonomous Robotic Welding]()

Obtaining good scans of the part around seams is critical for realizing accurate welds using an autonomous robotic system where part placement may have errors. We present a pipeline for planning scan trajectories that realizes high scan quality under part placement uncertainty. The planning is done offline to minimize the cycle time. The poster describes a metric for evaluating the uncertainty awareness that can be computed efficiently using the concepts of control variate and importance sampling. We also present the underlying scan trajectory planning algorithm that optimizes the stability of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.

### [Automated Fabrication of Magnetic Soft Microrobots (MSRs)]()

The advent of 3D printing has revolutionized many industries and has had similar improvements for soft robots. However, many challenges persist for these functional devices. Magnetic soft robots require the addition of magnetic particles that must be correctly oriented. There is a significant gap in the automated fabrication of 3D geometric structures with 3D magnetization direction. A fully automated 3D printer was designed to improve accuracy, speed, and reproducibility. This design was able to achieve a circular spot size(voxels) of 1.6mm in diameter. An updated optical system can improve the resolution to a square spot size of 50μm by 50μm. The new system achieves higher resolution designs as shown through magneto-mechanical simulations. Various microrobots including 'worm', 'gripper' and 'zipper' designs are evaluated with the new spot size.

### [Design and Control of an Ankle Foot Prosthesis with a Novel Spring Geometry]()

Robotic prostheses have the potential to dramatically improve amputee mobility, but many current state-of-the-art robotic devices cannot perform high-fidelity force control, and many are not powerful enough to emulate peak ankle torque at biological speeds. Current robotic systems suffer from excessive torque-tracking error, poor torque control bandwidth, and inability to precisely render passive mechanics. To overcome these obstacles, we have designed and manufactured the NEUfoot, a powerful platform for patient preference. To harness patient perception to tune a controller that is effective within the expected task space, the NEUfoot needs to emulate passive dynamics at a higher resolution than subjects can detect. To enable high fidelity ankle torque sensing for closed loop control, our system employs an ultra-high-resolution encoder for measuring spring deflection and a torque sensor, producing torque tracking that is both precise and accurate. By combining this encoder with a harmonic drive and a novel composite spring, we have achieved excellent torque control and the highest peak torque at biological speeds of any state-of-the-art foot-ankle prosthesis. We show that we can achieve good zero-impedance torque tracking at a high control loop frequency, which will enable high fidelity impedance control for patient preference experiments.

### [AI-Based Wearable Gait Analysis for Proactive Fall Risk Prediction]()

This study presents an AI-based framework for detecting anomalous gait patterns using deep learning techniques. We leveraged the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset containing tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartphones. Two models were developed: an autoencoder that reconstructs typical gait patterns and a GAN that distinguishes between normal and abnormal sequences. Data preprocessing involved window segmentation (2s, 50% overlap) and normalization. Models were trained exclusively on normal gait data, with synthetic anomalies introduced for evaluation. The autoencoder achieved 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.94) with normal segments showing low reconstruction error (0.08±0.01) compared to anomalous segments (0.20±0.03). The GAN demonstrated comparable performance with 93.2% accuracy (sensitivity: 0.92, specificity: 0.93). These findings highlight deep learning's potential to detect subtle gait abnormalities, enabling early intervention and continuous monitoring in clinical settings, though limited dataset size warrants future research with diverse cohorts and real-world perturbations.

### [Design of a Quasi-Passive Ankle Prosthesis with Two Degrees of Stiffness Variability]()

This paper will outline an approach to the design, control, and validation of a quasi-passive variable stiffness ankle prosthesis. The prosthesis can vary its overall stiffness via a novel linkage-based variable transmission. This transmission presents an improvement over prior designs in the field by eliminating backlash and maintaining the neutral ankle angle during stiffness variation. The prosthesis can additionally vary its plantarflexion stiffness via a sliding fulcrum. This adds a second degree of stiffness variation: the dorsiflexion to plantarflexion stiffness ratio. The stiffness of the foot will be characterized, and the ability of the foot to be used in an optimization procedure for user stiffness preference will be validated. This foot may be used as a clinical tool to facilitate the incorporation of stiffness preference into the prosthesis prescription process. It may be coupled with a task-identifying algorithm to serve as a daily-use prosthesis that can adjust stiffness based on the present gait task.

### [Automated 3D-Printing of Magnetic Soft Robots]()

Magnetic soft robots (MSRs) are a viable tool for many biomedical applications, such as targeted drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery, since they can be actuated remotely using external magnetic fields. These robots are developed by programming ferromagnetic domains with specific magnetizations using magnetic particles embedded in a flexible substrate. Existing fabrication methods rely on partially automated or manual processes, which limit production rates and realistic design iterations. To address these challenges, a fully automated workflow that translates robot simulations into an instruction set for a stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printer is presented. In this process, a rotating permanent magnet is used to program 3D magnetizations by reorienting hard magnetic particles within a photosensitive resin. Geometric resolutions of 1.6 mm are achieved with a layer height of 0.1 mm. Demonstrated applications include rolling and climbing locomotion in a maze and independent control of each arm in a multiarmed robot. By enabling fast, repeatable production of MSRs within 30 min, this automated system shortens the feedback loop from design to application, advancing their potential as a biomedical tool.

### [Post-Convergence Sim-To-Real Policy Transfer: A Principled Alternative to Cherry-Picking]()

Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have become widely used for developing policies for autonomous agents, such as locomotion policies for legged robots. RL training typically maximizes a predefined reward (or minimizes a corresponding cost/loss) by iteratively optimizing policies within a simulator. Starting from a randomly initialized policy, the empirical expected reward follows a trajectory with an overall increasing trend. While some policies become temporarily stuck in local optima, a well-defined training process generally converges to a reward level with noisy oscillations. However, selecting a policy for real-world deployment is rarely an analytical decision (i.e., simply choosing the one with the highest reward) and is instead often performed through trial and error. To improve sim-to-real transfer, some focus on the pre-convergence stage, employing techniques such as domain randomization, multi-fidelity training, adversarial training, and architectural innovations. However, these methods do not eliminate the inevitable convergence trajectory and noisy oscillations of rewards, leading to heuristic policy selection or cherry-picking. This project addresses the post-convergence sim-to-real transfer problem by introducing a worst-case performance transference optimization approach, formulated as an optimization problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in transferring locomotion policies from simulation to real-world.

### [Deep Monocular Vision-Inertial State Estimation for Autonomous UAV Shipboard Landing]()

This work presents a deep learning-based monocular vision-inertial system for relative state estimation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during autonomous shipboard landing. Building on our prior Transformer Neural Network Multi Object(TNN-MO) for pose estimation from monocular images, we integrate inertial measurements through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation under motion blur, challenging dynamic lighting conditions, and GPS-denied conditions. The TNN-MO is trained to detect 2D keypoints of predefined ship structures using a synthetic dataset rendered in Blender with diverse textures, lighting, and viewpoints. 	 We validate our system through both indoor and outdoor experiments. Indoor tests utilize our vision-in-the-loop simulation framework based on photo-realistic environments created with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Outdoor validation is performed through in-situ flight experiments using the US Naval Academy research vessel. Results show enhanced accuracy and robustness over vision-only and GPS-based methods, demonstrating the system’s effectiveness for autonomous UAV operations in dynamic maritime environments.

### [Efficient Social Navigation: Leveraging Discrete Morse Theory for Dynamic Agent Interaction]()

Robotic navigation in dynamic environments presents significant challenges, particularly in managing interactions with moving agents while ensuring efficient path planning. We introduce a novel integration of social navigation strategies with topological path planning, leveraging Discrete Morse Theory, Vietoris-Rips complex, and a homotopical framework to enhance adaptability. Our method dynamically assesses path feasibility and optimizes trajectory selection through three key strategies: waiting, deflection, and diverse path selection. By incorporating Morse values into a sampling-based roadmap, our approach prioritizes critical configurations for efficient motion planning. Unlike existing methods that rely on static heuristics or extensive learning-based predictions, our framework offers a real-time, adaptive mechanism for congestion-aware navigation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate an efficient solution(< 100s in computation) with improved path adaptability, resulting in 30 − 60% increase in traversal time in environments containing 3 − 9 degrees of freedom robot and 15 − 60 dynamic agents.

### [Model-Based Learning for High-Resolution Radar Imaging in Autonomous Vehicles]()

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are indispensable for perception tasks of autonomous vehicles, thanks to their resilience in challenging weather and light conditions. Yet, their deployment is often limited by insufficient spatial resolution for precise semantic scene interpretation. Classical super-resolution techniques adapted from optical imaging inadequately address the distinct characteristics of radar data. In response, our study herein redefines super-resolution radar imaging as a one-dimensional (1D) signal super-resolution spectra estimation problem by harnessing the radar signal domain knowledge, introducing innovative data normalization, signal-level augmentation, and a domain-informed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-guided loss function. Like an image drawn with points and lines, radar imaging can be viewed as generated from points (antenna elements) and lines (frequency spectra). Our tailored deep learning network for automotive radar imaging exhibits remarkable scalability and parameter efficiency, alongside enhanced performance in terms of radar imaging quality and resolution. We further present a novel real-world dataset, pivotal for both advancing radar imaging and refining super-resolution spectra estimation techniques. Extensive testing confirms that our SR-SPECNet sets a new benchmark in producing high-resolution radar range-azimuth images, outperforming existing methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/ruxinzh/SR-SPECNet.

### [Energy-Aware Informative Path Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System]()

Effective energy management is essential for maximizing information gathering in networked mobile robots, particularly for large-scale, energy-intensive tasks such as agricultural monitoring and wildfire mapping. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates robots’ energy profiles with confidence bounds of their assigned regions to optimize sampling targets. Designed for persistent, long-term deployments, the framework employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to maximize data acquisition and accurately reconstruct unknown spatial distributions (e.g., algae outbreaks or humidity maps). The method enables seamless transitions between exploration (mapping uncertain regions when energy is high), exploitation (refining maps at moderate energy levels), and recharging (navigating to charging stations when energy is low). Rigorous theoretical analysis ensures appropriate mode transitions, achieving optimal energy-balanced informative path planning. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness in generating energy-efficient, distinct paths for heterogeneous robots, delivering up to 32% energy savings while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy.

### [PINNClothSim: Using Physics-Informed Neural Network to Simulate the Cloth Behavior]()

Pinn has been proven to solve inverse problems of parameter estimation and forward problem of solving energy equilibrium thin-shell theory. The idea is to use PINN to build a dynamic simulator for fabric. The contribution will be: 1. the first PINN-based dynamic neural solver for real-time cloth behavior simulation. 2. the kernel-based global collision method integrates interactions over all point pairs using smooth, differentiable kernel functions, emphasizing close contacts in a globally consistent manner, unlike traditional local methods that rely solely on nearest distance metrics. 3. the coulomb friction equation is added as another physics constrain penalty form. Later, after building the simulator, it can be added in model-based reinforcement learning and train the policy for fabric manipulation.

### [A Self-Supervised Framework for Embodied Active Event Perception]()

Real-world robotic systems must perceive, interpret, and act on dynamic events in real-time, without relying on large labeled datasets, handcrafted rewards, or storing sensitive data. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce EASE, a self-supervised framework for embodied event perception and control that minimizes predictive free energy as an intrinsic signal for learning. EASE integrates a hierarchical perception module, which anticipates feature-level sensory observations, with a reinforcement learning-based motor policy that selects actions to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. This closed-loop architecture enables agents to segment, summarize, and track salient actors without predefined task supervision or post-hoc processing. Through experiments in simulation and on a LoCoBot platform, we demonstrate that EASE achieves competitive accuracy on segmentation and tracking benchmarks, while also exhibiting emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target reacquisition, and motion-contingent exploration. By eliminating the need for stored visual data and enabling real-time adaptation, EASE offers a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for interactive event understanding.

### [Equi-RO: A 4D Millimeter-Wave Radar Odometry Based on Equivariant Networks]()

Accurate odometry estimation is crucial for autonomous systems in GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we propose Equi-RO, an equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our method pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant features and employs separate networks to process equivariant and invariant features. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the open-source dataset show Equi-RO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.

### [Framework to Evaluate LLM’s Ability to Reason about Physical Disabilities from Medical Perspective]()

Physically Assistive Robots help people with physical disabilities perform various activities of daily living. Largely, these robots overfit particular populations or groups of people, prompting a need for personalization. In this work, we present a work-in-progress framework to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLM) in their ability to reason about physical disabilities, especially in context of supporting personalization. We compiled a dataset that includes five physical disabilities, generated several anatomically accurate physical functions of the body, and curated brief real medical histories for people with a particular physical disability. Using the disability dataset, real patient histories, and body functions, we designed prompts. We expect to use zero-shot prompting techniques to evaluate LLM performance in this context. Our next step is to conduct an LLM evaluation study against ground truth compiled through a data collection study with doctors.

### [Predicting Subjective Values of Trust with Interdependence Variables]()

This study investigates the use of variables described in interdependence theory to model human perceptions of robotic behavior in trust-based scenarios. An XGBoost model was trained to predict the average reported Likert scores of participants that rated the morality and performance of a simulated robot. Reflexive control (RC), fate control (FC), and bilateral control (BC), which quantify self-influence, collaborator influence, and mutual dependence, were calculated from payoff matrices and used as input features. The model was trained on scaled data from more than 200 participant evaluations, achieving a mean squared error of 0.18 in the standardized space, equivalent to approximately 1.27 Likert points of average prediction error. Participants engaged in a repeated trust game with a simulated robot partner during a search and rescue mission, where cooperation was incentivized through a team bonus and trust violations were introduced in later rounds. After each interaction, the participants rated the robot’s morality and performance on a 7-point Likert scale. The results demonstrate that the interdependence variables capture the latent structure of human-robot trust dynamics and offer a promising framework for predicting subjective evaluations of robotic behavior.

### [Configuration-Dependent Robot Kinematics Model and Calibration]()

Accurate robot kinematics is critical for precise tool placement using joint control of an articulated robot. Traditional kinematics calibration using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters is sensitive to joint-axis directions. Product-of-Exponentials (POE) parameterization is more robust but is non-minimal. Robot kinematics is also affected by the pose of the robot in different parts of the workspace due to joint tolerance, especially for massive payloads. This paper compares multiple POE-based kinematics calibration methods. We propose a configuration-dependent parameterization which is shown to have the best overall performance. In addition, for a traditional 6-DoF elbow manipulator, the configuration dependency is mostly on the shoulder and elbow angles. We show that the configuration dependence of the kinematics parameters may be adequately captured by these two angles.

### [Multi-Robot Path Planning Using Natural Language Instructions]()

This work presents an efficient natural language-assisted navigation planning framework for mobile robots. The proposed system integrates a language model with a modified Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, enabling robots to interpret user instructions. In our preliminary work, the planner improves efficiency by focusing on specific areas of the robot’s workspace based on these instructions, making it faster and less resource-intensive. It significantly reduces the number of nodes by approximately 55% and the number of queries by approximately 80% compared to traditional RRT methods. The approach was validated in both simulated and real-world environments involving complex navigation scenarios, consistently demonstrating superior performance. We plan to extend this work to multi-robot systems using a decoupled, priority-based strategy, where priority is assigned based on the trajectory length of the robots—the highest priority is assigned to the robot with the longest trajectory. The overall approach will demonstrate the effectiveness of language-guided planning for real-world robotic navigation.

### [An Open-Source Soft Robotic Platform for Autonomous Aerial Manipulation in the Wild]()

Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally, researchers have relied on offboard perception systems, which are limited to expensive and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to autonomously grasp various objects in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our ROS 2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible to the broader research community.

### [Collaborative Human-Robot Manipulation for Composite Sheet Layup Applications]()

This work presents a collaborative human-robot manipulation framework tailored for composite layup applications, where fiber-reinforced sheets must be precisely placed and affixed onto mold surfaces. Building upon a dual-mode control architecture, the proposed system supports (1) obstacle- and stress-aware collaborative transportation of flexible sheets and (2) contact-intensive layup operations involving human-robot coordination. In the first mode, robots assist with fabric positioning while ensuring safe manipulation through predictive simulation and control barrier functions (CBFs). The second mode leverages real-time Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) simulation to estimate sheet deformation, stress, and contact states, enabling robots to dynamically adjust holding poses and maintain sheet tautness as the human operator manually presses the material onto the mold. By incorporating simulation-informed control into a shared autonomy framework, the system preserves material integrity and avoids overstressing or accidental detachment during layup. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in handling complex, curved mandrel surfaces with minimal wrinkling and improved operator ergonomics. This work highlights a scalable, safety-aware control strategy for collaborative manipulation of 2D deformable objects in manufacturing environments.

### [Stretch, but Don’t Snap: Coordinating Multi-Agent Teams under Competing Goals]()

This work explores coordination strategies for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The team comprises larger leader agents and smaller follower agents (children), each equipped with UWB antennas to measure relative distances within a limited range. We frame the coordination challenge as a trade-off between expansion and contraction: the former aims to cover the environment, while the latter maintains proximity for communication and task execution. These conflicting goals are modeled through a lightweight, decentralized optimization framework in which each agent balances local objectives with team-level robustness constraints. To analyze and guide this coordination, we define three key metrics: coverage (to assess spatial expansion), connectivity (based on edge cuts and inter-agent distances), and dispersion (using the Laplacian of the positioned graph). The trade-off between team and local goals is modeled through a convex combination of expansion and contraction tasks. Through both centralized and decentralized optimization scenarios, we show how tuning the dispersion constraint impacts the team’s behavior, shaping feasible configurations that preserve connectivity while maximizing the current task.

### [From Reals to Logic and Back: Learning World Models for Planning from Raw Data]()

Humans are able to learn to solve complex tasks based on simple demonstrations. However, this is a challenging problem for robotics; current training data requirements make it difficult to develop reliable autonomous robots for settings where test tasks feature more objects and longer horizons than those encountered during learning. We show that enabling a robot to autonomously invent well-founded concepts can allow it to learn and transfer knowledge more efficiently from small batches of demonstrations on simple tasks. The robot is then able to learn world models and solve new, complex tasks at a level comparable with hand-crafted models. Empirical results indicate that this framework allows robots to solve new tasks with much longer execution horizons and many more objects than those encountered in demonstrations (up to 18x more objects), in zero-shot fashion. This yields the first known approach for autonomously inventing relational concepts and for learning logic-based generalizable world models from small batches of unannotated high-dimensional, real-valued robot demonstrations.

### [Imaginative World Modeling with Scene Graphs for Embodied Agent Navigation]()

The semantic navigation task requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy, which predicts future scenes before taking action, can significantly improve efficiency. However, current imaginative navigation methods primarily depend on image-based world modeling that forecasts future image viewpoints, resulting in substantial computational overhead and failing to deliver consistent global predictions. To address these issues, we introduce SGImagineNav, a novel symbolic world modeling-based proactive navigation framework that builds a global environmental representation with hierarchical scene graph and leverages large language models (LLMs) to predict unseen parts of the environment. During navigation, SGImagineNav maintains an incomplete local scene graph of observed areas, while LLMs infer the likely structure of unobserved regions. With this more complete scene graph, the agent then estimates the target’s location, identifies an optimal viewpoint, and proceeds toward it. Extensive evaluations on HM3D benchmarks show that SGImagineNav outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating notable improvements in reasoning capability and navigation efficiency.

### [Consensus Building in Human-Robot Co-Learning Via Bias Controlled Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics and Nonverbal Communication through Robotic Eyes]()

Consensus between humans and robots is crucial as robotic agents become more prevalent and deeply integrated into our daily lives. This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remain under-explored. This work demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as nonlinear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot’s opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These cues non-verbally communicate the robot’s future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot’s opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with 51 participants (N=51) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be built in a human-robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed insights into perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.

### [Landmark-Based 3D LiDAR Segmentation SLAM for Logistic Warehouses : Preliminary Result]()

This study proposes a landmark-based 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation approach tailored for agricultural logistics warehouse environments and presents preliminary experimental results. Conventional SLAM systems often experience degraded map quality and localization inaccuracies in indoor settings with numerous dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we collected 3D point cloud data using a LiDAR sensor deployed in an agricultural logistics warehouse and annotated key semantic entities such as boxes, pallets, workers, and forklifts. Based on this annotated dataset, we are currently training a RandLA-Net-based semantic segmentation model capable of distinguishing between dynamic and static objects. The segmentation results will be integrated into a SLAM framework to suppress noise caused by dynamic elements and improve overall map consistency. Initial results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of applying semantic SLAM technologies to complex agricultural logistics scenarios. Future work will focus on developing a fully integrated semantic SLAM system to support real-time autonomous navigation and intelligent logistics automation of agricultural environments.

### [ECHO: A Testbed for High-Fidelity Synthetic Martian Terrain Simulations Using Unreal Engine]()

Mars exploration presents unique navigation challenges due to unstructured terrain, edge-case environments, and limited availability of annotated training data. Traditional physical testbeds—such as those built in desert environments—lack the ability to simulate diverse and repeatable Martian conditions. We present Echo, an open-source digital testbed designed to simulate Martian terrain environments and enable rapid evaluation of autonomous perception frameworks. Built in Unreal Engine, Echo allows researchers to construct realistic 3D landscapes that include rare or extreme terrain classes, simulate environmental variables and generate synthetic datasets for computer vision tasks. The platform supports integrated pipelines for object detection and semantic segmentation, facilitating the development and benchmarking of navigation algorithms in reproducible, high-fidelity settings. Echo currently features a custom rover simulator with first- and third-person camera perspectives, in-simulation image capture tools, and a working YOLO-based object detection model trained on a custom 3D asset. Planned work include the development of labeled Martian terrain datasets and real-time semantic segmentation of surface types such as sand, bedrock, and large rocks. Echo’s modular design can aid student researchers, educators, and the wider autonomy community to prototype and test vision-based algorithms for improving autonomy in Martian applications.

### [A Biomimetic Robotic Hand with Anatomically Correct 3D Braided Tendons - towards the Scalable Production of Complex Bio-Inspired Robots]()

With the recent advancements in the fields of humanoid robotics and multi-fingered hands, production demand for such systems is increasing rapidly as more and more applications are emerging for dexterous manipulation. Robotic solutions advanced enough for such capabilities usually bear significant costs, however, mostly due to their high complexity - their mechanical subsystems alone comprise a large number of separate components, often of elaborate shape or structure, each with their unique supply chain, materials, machining, tooling and assembly requirements. This is especially true when striving to mimic the human hand’s soft and durable tissues and complex biomechanics more closely - an aspiration of many developers towards increasing the naturality of movements and human-likeness for better embodiment and safer human interactions. There is therefore a strong need to address value chain complexity, assembly time, and thus total cost of manufacturing, by simplifying complicated designs and reducing the number of components - without negatively impacting functionality. For this purpose, this work presents an anatomically accurate robotic hand designed and built using modern design automation methods and advanced textile technologies, to exemplify how such practices can be utilized for leveraging the inherent benefits of highly biomimetic constructions while keeping production and assembly simple and cost-effective.

### [Path Planning and Optimization for Cuspidal 6R Manipulators]()

Cuspidal robots switch inverse kinematics (IK) solutions without crossing singularities. This means classical path planning algorithms may fail for cuspidal robots. The feasibility of a given task-space path depends on the choice of IK solution, but industrial simulators from ABB and FANUC do not return all IK solutions. Furthermore, a given tasks-space path entirely in the workspace may not be feasible at all, even though there are valid IK solutions for each point along the path. We introduce three new algorithms for cuspidal robot identification and path planning. These algorithms are enabled by IK-Geo, our highly efficient IK solver which can find all IK solutions for any robot using subproblem decomposition. First, we propose a new efficient method for cuspidal robot identification. For the first time, we identified that the ABB GoFa and some robots with three parallel axes are cuspidal. Next, we propose a new path planning method for cuspidal robots by finding all IK solutions for each point along a task-space path and constructing a graph to connect each vertex corresponding to an IK solution. Graph edges have a weight based on the optimization metric, such as minimizing joint velocity. The optimal feasible path is the shortest path in the graph. Finally, we incorporate this path planning method into a path optimization algorithm. We find the optimal rigid-body offset of a given end effector path.

### [Diverse Controllable Diffusion Policy with Signal Temporal Logic]()

Generating realistic simulations is critical for autonomous system applications such as self-driving and human-robot interactions. However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature "single-outcome", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors. In this paper, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate, and the lowest collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot encounter scenarios shows our approach can generate diverse and closed-to-oracle trajectories. The annotation tool, augmented dataset, and code are available at https://github.com/mengyuest/pSTL-diffusion-policy.

### [Dual-Conditioned Temporal Diffusion Modeling for Driving Scene Generation]()

Diffusion models have proven effective at generating high-quality images from learned distributions, but their application to the temporal domain, especially for driving scenarios, remains underexplored. Our work addresses key challenges in existing simulations, such as limited data quality, diversity, and high costs, by extending diffusion models to generate realistic long driving videos. We introduce the Dual-conditioned Temporal Diffusion Model (DcTDM), an open-source method that incorporates dual conditioning to enforce temporal consistency by guiding frame transitions. Alongside DcTDM, we present DriveSceneDDM, a comprehensive driving video dataset featuring textual scene descriptions, dense depth maps, and canny edge data. We evaluate DcTDM using common video quality metrics, demonstrating its superior performance over other video diffusion models by producing long, temporally consistent driving videos up to 40s, achieving over 25% improvement in consistency and frame quality.

### [RL-OGM-Parking: Lidar OGM-Based Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Planner for Autonomous Parking]()

Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy, consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world scenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms pure rule-based and learning-based methods. The real-world experiment further validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.

### [Multi-Task Invariant Representation Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving]()

Imitation learning is a promising approach to acquiring autonomous driving policies by mimicking human driver behaviors. However, a major drawback of existing driving policies derived from imitation learning is their proneness to capturing spurious correlations, owing to the lack of an explicit causal model. Deploying such policies in unpredictable real-world environments poses severe risks, as spurious correlations may result in flawed decisions that compromise safety. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach called Multi-Task Invariant Representation Imitation Learning (MIRIL). MIRIL combines invariant learning with imitation learning to identify cross-environment invariant causal representations from driving demonstrations in various scenarios. These representations are then fed into multiple downstream branches for multi-task learning, including policy learning, perception prediction, invariant representation learning, and transition dynamics learning. Through the multi-task learning approach, the model not only makes consistent driving decisions across different environments but also perceives the vehicle's surroundings, thereby improving adaptability and robustness in diverse driving conditions. This enables MIRIL to effectively handle a wide range of driving scenarios, ensuring safety and efficiency. Supported by clear metrics, this paper details our comprehensive experimental setup, including datasets, benchmarks, and comparative analyses, underscoring the capability of MIRIL to significantly boost system generalization and excel in decision-making significantly.

### [Occ-LLM: Enhancing Autonomous Driving with Occupancy-Based Large Language Models]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial advancements in the field of robotic and autonomous driving. This study presents the first Occupancy-based Large Language Model (Occ-LLM), which represents a pioneering effort to integrate LLMs with an important representation. To effectively encode occupancy as input for the LLM and address the category imbalances associated with occupancy, we propose Motion Separation Variational Autoencoder (MS-VAE). This innovative approach utilizes prior knowledge to distinguish dynamic objects from static scenes before inputting them into a tailored Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This separation enhances the model's capacity to concentrate on dynamic trajectories while effectively reconstructing static scenes. The efficacy of Occ-LLM has been validated across key tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, self-ego planning, and occupancy-based scene question answering. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Occ-LLM significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving gains of about 6% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 4% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for the task of 4D occupancy forecasting. These findings highlight the transformative potential of Occ-LLM in reshaping current paradigms within robotic and autonomous driving.

### [DISC: Dataset for Analyzing Driving Styles in Simulated Crashes for Mixed Autonomy]()

Handling pre-crash scenarios is still a major challenge for self-driving cars due to limited data & human-driving behavior datasets. We introduce DISC, one of the first datasets designed to capture various driving styles & behaviors in pre-crash scenarios for mixed autonomy analysis. DISC includes over 8 classes of driving styles/behaviors from hundreds of drivers navigating a simulated vehicle through a virtual city, encountering rare-event traffic scenarios. This dataset enables the classification of pre-crash human driving behaviors in unsafe conditions, supporting individualized trajectory prediction based on observed driving patterns. It offers the potential to improve autonomous vehicle safety by accounting for diverse human driving behaviors in stressful traffic & rare accident scenarios, which are otherwise difficult or risky to capture. By utilizing a VR-based driving simulator, TRAVERSE, data was collected through a driver-centric study involving human drivers encountering 12 simulated accident scenarios. This dataset fills a critical gap in human-centric driving data for rare events involving interactions with autonomous vehicles. It enables autonomous systems to better react to human drivers & optimize trajectory prediction in mixed autonomy environments involving both human-driven & self-driving cars. It includes essential data such as acceleration, braking & vehicle pose providing a foundation for machine-learning models in autonomous vehicles. In addition, individual driving behaviors are classified through a set of standardized questionnaires, carefully designed to identify & categorize driving behavior. We correlate data features with driving behaviors, showing that the simulated environment reflects real-world driving styles. DISC is the first dataset to capture how various driving styles respond to accident scenarios, offering significant potential to enhance autonomous vehicle safety and driving behavior analysis in mixed autonomy environments.

### [Real-World Automated Vehicle Longitudinal Stability Analysis: Controller Design and Field Test]()

Although extensive research has been conducted on modeling the stable longitudinal controller of automated vehicles (AVs) to dampen traffic oscillations, the real-world performance of these controllers in actual vehicles remains uncertain. In the operation of real-world AVs, the delay between actual dynamics and the commands prevents the controller's command from being effectively implemented to dampen traffic oscillations. Thus, this study adapts the designed controllers within an AV test platform to compare the theoretically stable conditions with the actual oscillation dampening performance. Initially, we compute the stable conditions for both the traditional car-following controller, which assumes no delay, and the longitudinal controller that accounts for the dynamic response of the vehicle. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that the longitudinal controller predicts vehicle stability more accurately than conventional car-following controller, showing an improvement from an average prediction accuracy rate of 0.59 to 0.91. Also, the experiments uncover specific delays inherent in dynamics systems, with a response delay of 0.34 seconds. Our work makes two principal contributions to the field of AV control systems. First, it empirically validates that the longitudinal model, which accounts for the vehicle's dynamic responses, offers a more precise representation of vehicular behavior. Second, the relatively brief response delay identified expands the stability region, thereby enhancing vehicle control and safety. The longitudinal controller is critical for enhancing AV performance and reliability in dampening traffic oscillations.

### [RoDyn-SLAM: Robust Dynamic Dense RGB-D SLAM with Neural Radiance Fields]()

Leveraging neural implicit representation to conduct dense RGB-D SLAM has been studied in recent years. However, this approach relies on a static environment assumption and does not work robustly within a dynamic environment due to the inconsistent observation of geometry and photometry. To address the challenges presented in dynamic environments, we propose a novel dynamic SLAM framework with neural radiance field. Specifically, we introduce a motion mask generation method to filter out the invalid sampled rays. This design effectively fuses the optical flow mask and semantic mask to enhance the precision of motion mask. To further improve the accuracy of pose estimation, we have designed a divide-and-conquer pose optimization algorithm that distinguishes between keyframes and non-keyframes. The proposed edge warp loss can effectively enhance the geometry constraints between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two challenging datasets, and the results show that RoDyn-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance among recent neural RGB-D methods in both accuracy and robustness.

### [HS-SLAM: Hybrid Representation with Structural Supervision for Improved Dense SLAM]()

NeRF-based SLAM has recently achieved promising results in tracking and reconstruction. However, existing methods face challenges in providing sufficient scene representation, capturing structural information, and maintaining global consistency in scenes emerging significant movement or being forgotten. To this end, we present HS-SLAM to tackle these problems. To enhance scene representation capacity, we propose a hybrid encoding network that combines the complementary strengths of hash-grid, tri-planes, and one-blob, improving the completeness and smoothness of reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce structural supervision by sampling patches of non-local pixels rather than individual rays to better capture the scene structure. To ensure global consistency, we implement an active global bundle adjustment (BA) to eliminate camera drifts and mitigate accumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that HS-SLAM outperforms the baselines in tracking and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining the efficiency required for robotics.

### [Gassidy: Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Dynamic Environments]()

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allows flexible adjustments to scene representation, enabling continuous optimization of scene quality during dense visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in static environments. However, 3DGS faces challenges in handling environmental disturbances from dynamic objects with irregular movement, leading to degradation in both camera tracking accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we develop an RGB-D dense SLAM which is called Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Dynamic Environments (Gassidy). This approach calculates Gaussians to generate rendering loss flows for each environmental component based on a designed photometric-geometric loss function. To distinguish and filter environmental disturbances, we iteratively analyze rendering loss flows to detect features characterized by changes in loss values between dynamic objects and static components. This process ensures a clean environment for accurate scene reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art SLAM methods, experimental results on open datasets show that Gassidy improves camera tracking precision by up to 97.9% and enhances map quality by up to 6%.

### [Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting SLAM]()

The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM. However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches.

### [OpenGS-SLAM: Open-Set Dense Semantic SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Object-Level Scene Understanding]()

Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly improved the efficiency and quality of dense semantic SLAM. However, previous methods are generally constrained by limited-category pre-trained classifiers and implicit semantic representation, which hinder their performance in open-set scenarios and restrict 3D object-level scene understanding. To address these issues, we propose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments. Our system integrates explicit semantic labels derived from 2D foundational models into the 3D Gaussian framework, facilitating robust 3D object-level scene understanding. We introduce Gaussian Voting Splatting to enable fast 2D label map rendering and scene updating. Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based 2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views. Furthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10× faster semantic rendering and 2× lower storage costs compared to existing methods.

### [SAP-SLAM: Semantic-Assisted Perception SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting]()

The integration of 3D Gaussians has introduced a novel scene representation in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), characterized by explicit representation and differentiable rendering capabilities that enhance scene reconstruction and understanding. However, most current SLAM systems only exploit the basic representational capacity of 3D Gaussians, neglecting their potential to offer richer information and facilitate higher-dimensional scene comprehension. Furthermore, these systems often struggle with reconstruction when encountering rapid camera movements or depth missing. Drawing inspiration from 3D language field, which explores the intrinsic relationships among scene objects, we propose SAP-SLAM, a dense SLAM system that combines robust tracking, high-fidelity reconstruction, and advanced semantic understanding. Our approach leverages pre-trained visual models to extract semantic features, which are then fused, dimensionally reduced, and encoded into the 3D Gaussian model for optimization and rendering. The integration of these features improves the systems’ semantic comprehension and scene representation, ultimately enabling the creation of high-precision 3D semantic maps. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-guided Gaussian densification and pruning strategy, which uses semantic consistency to prioritize attention on poorly reconstructed areas, greatly improving performance in complex scenarios. SAP-SLAM achieves competitive results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior capabilities in semantic understanding and reconstruction.

### [Gaussian-LIC: Real-Time Photo-Realistic SLAM with Gaussian Splatting and LiDAR-Inertial-Camera Fusion]()

In this paper, we present a real-time photo-realistic SLAM method based on marrying Gaussian Splatting with LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM. Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code will be released on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic.

### [Risk-Averse Model Predictive Control for Racing in Adverse Conditions]()

Model predictive control (MPC) algorithms can be sensitive to model mismatch when used in challenging nonlinear control tasks. In particular, the performance of MPC for vehicle control at the limits of handling suffers when the underlying model overestimates the vehicle’s performance capability. In this work, we propose a risk-averse MPC framework that explicitly accounts for uncertainty over friction limits and tire parameters. Our approach leverages a sample-based approximation of an optimal control problem with a conditional value at risk (CVaR) constraint. This sample-based formulation enables planning with a set of expressive vehicle dynamics models using different tire parameters. Moreover, this formulation enables efficient numerical resolution via sequential quadratic programming and GPU parallelization. Experiments on a Lexus LC 500 show that risk-averse MPC unlocks reliable performance, while a deterministic baseline that plans using a single dynamics model may lose control of the vehicle in adverse road conditions.

### [Kineto-Dynamical Planning and Accurate Execution of Minimum-Time Maneuvers on Three-Dimensional Circuits]()

Online planning and execution of minimum-time maneuvers on three-dimensional (3D) circuits is an open challenge in autonomous vehicle racing. In this paper, we present an artificial race driver (ARD) to learn the vehicle dynamics, plan and execute minimum-time maneuvers on a 3D track. ARD integrates a novel kineto-dynamical (KD) vehicle model for trajectory planning with economic nonlinear model predictive control (E-NMPC). We use a high-fidelity vehicle simulator (VS) to compare the closed-loop ARD results with a minimum-lap-time optimal control problem (MLT-VS), solved offline with the same VS. Our ARD sets lap times close to the MLT-VS, and the new KD model outperforms a literature benchmark. Finally, we study the vehicle trajectories, to assess the re-planning capabilities of ARD under execution errors. A video with the main results is available as supplementary material.

### [Safety Guaranteed Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Control for Connected and Automated Vehicles]()

We address the problem of coordination and control of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in the presence of imperfect observations in mixed traffic environment. A commonly used approach is learning-based decision-making, such as reinforcement learning (RL). However, most existing safe RL methods suffer from two limitations: (i) they assume accurate state information, and (ii) safety is generally defined over the expectation of the trajectories. It remains challenging to design optimal coordination between multi-agents while ensuring hard safety constraints under system state uncertainties (e.g., those that arise from noisy sensor measurements, communication, or state estimation methods) at every time step. We propose a safety guaranteed hierarchical coordination and control scheme called Safe-RMM to address the challenge. Specifically, the high-level coordination policy of CAVs in mixed traffic environment is trained by the Robust Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (RMAPPO) method. Though trained without uncertainty, our method leverages a worst-case Q network to ensure the model's robust performances when state uncertainties are present during testing. The low-level controller is implemented using model predictive control (MPC) with robust Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety through their forward invariance property. We compare our method with baselines in different road networks in the CARLA simulator. Results show that our method provides the best evaluated safety and efficiency in challenging mixed traffic environments with uncertainties.

### [Does Bilevel Optimization Result in More Competitive Racing Behavior?]()

Two-vehicle racing is natural example of a competitive dynamic game. As with most dynamic games, there are many ways in which the underlying solution concept can be structured, resulting in different equilibrium concepts. The assumed solution concept influences the behaviors of two interacting players in racing. For example, blocking behavior emerges naturally in leader-follower play, but to achieve this in Nash play the costs would have to be chosen specifically to trigger this behavior. In this work, we develop a novel model for competitive two-player vehicle racing, represented as an equilibrium problem, complete with simplified aerodynamic drag and drafting effects, as well as position-dependent collision-avoidance responsibility. We use our model to explore how different solution concepts affect competitiveness. We develop a solution for bilevel optimization problems, enabling a large-scale empirical study comparing bilevel strategies (either as leader or follower), Nash equilibrium strategy and a single-player constant velocity baseline. We find the choice of strategies significantly affects competitive performance and safety.

### [Gate-Aware Online Planning for Two-Player Autonomous Drone Racing]()

The flying speed of autonomous quadrotors has increased significantly in the field of autonomous drone racing. However, most research primarily focuses on the aggressive flight of a single quadrotor, simplifying the racing gate traversal problem to a waypoint passing problem that neglects the orientations of the racing gates {or implicitly considers the waypoint direction during path planning}. In this paper, we propose a systematic method called Pairwise Model Predictive Control (PMPC) that can guide two quadrotors online to navigate racing gates with minimal time and without collisions. The flight task is initially simplified as a point-mass model waypoint passing problem to provide time optimal reference through an efficient two-step velocity search method. Subsequently, we utilize the spatial configuration of the racing track to compute the optimal heading at each gate, maximizing the visibility of subsequent gates for the quadrotors. To address varying gate orientations, we introduce a novel Magnetic Induction Line-based spatial curve to guide the quadrotors through racing gates of different orientations. Furthermore, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem that uses the point-mass trajectory as initial values and references to enhance solving efficiency. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments. In real-world tests, the two quadrotors achieved a top speed of 6.1 m/s on a 7-waypoint racing track within a compact flying arena of 5 m * 4 m * 2 m.

### [TC-Driver: A Trajectory Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Approach to Zero-Shot Autonomous Racing (I)]()

Autonomous racing challenges perception, planning, and control algorithms, serving as a testbed for general autonomous driving. While traditional methods like MPC can generate optimal control sequences, they are sensitive to modeling parameter accuracy. This paper introduces TC-Driver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for robust control in autonomous racing, addressing tire parameter modeling inaccuracies. TC-Driver is conditioned by a trajectory from any high-level planner, combining RL’s learning capabilities with the reliability of traditional planning. Trained under varying tire conditions, it aims to generalize across different model parameters, enhancing real-world racing performance. Experimental results show TC-Driver improves generalization robustness compared to a state-of-the-art end-to-end architecture. It achieves a 29-fold improvement in crash ratio when facing model mismatch and successfully transfers to unseen tracks with new features, while the baseline fails. In physical deployment, TC-Driver demonstrates zero-shot Sim2Real capabilities, outperforming end-to-end agents 10-fold in crash ratio while maintaining similar driving characteristics in reality as in simulation. This hybrid RL architecture leverages traditional planning methods’ reliability while exploiting RL’s ability to handle model uncertainties, offering a robust solution for autonomous racing challenges.

### [Er.autopilot 1.1: A Software Stack for Autonomous Racing on Oval and Road Course Tracks (I)]()

In its first two seasons, the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) organized a series of autonomous racing events across some of the most renowned oval racetracks, introducing various challenges including high-speed solo runs, static obstacle avoidance, and complex head-to-head passing competitions. In 2023, the challenge expanded to include a time-trial event on the iconic F1 Monza road course.

Building on the previous version, this updated stack integrates new features such as LiDAR-based localization, lateral velocity estimation, a radar-based local controller for safe pull-overs, and refined vehicle modeling for the Model Predictive Controller. We present the overall results along with insights and lessons learned from the first two seasons, during which the team consistently achieved the podium.

### [FlatFusion: Delving into Details of Sparse Transformer-Based Camera-LiDAR Fusion for Autonomous Driving]()

The integration of data from various sensor modalities (e.g. camera and LiDAR) constitutes a prevalent methodology within the ambit of autonomous driving scenarios. Recent advancements in efficient point cloud transformers have underscored the efficacy of integrating information in sparse formats. When it comes to fusion, since image patches are dense in pixel space with ambiguous depth, it necessitates additional design considerations for effective fusion. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of design choices for transformer-based sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. This investigation encompasses strategies for image-to-3D and LiDAR-to-2D mapping, attention neighbor grouping, single modal tokenizer, and micro-structure of Transformer. By amalgamating the most effective principles uncovered through our investigation, we introduce FlatFusion, a carefully designed framework for sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. Notably, FlatFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse Transformer-based methods, including UniTR, CMT, and SparseFusion, achieving 73.7 NDS on the nuScenes validation set with 10.1 FPS with PyTorch.

### [A2DO: Adaptive Anti-Degradation Odometry with Deep Multi-Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Navigation]()

Accurate localization is essential for the safe and effective navigation of autonomous vehicles, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a cornerstone technology in this context. However, The performance of the SLAM system can deteriorate under challenging conditions such as low light, adverse weather, or obstructions due to sensor degradation. We present A2DO, a novel end-to-end multi- sensor fusion odometry system that enhances robustness in these scenarios through deep neural networks. A2DO integrates LiDAR and visual data, employing a multi-layer, multi-scale feature encoding module augmented by an attention mechanism to mitigate sensor degradation dynamically. The system is pre- trained extensively on simulated datasets covering a broad range of degradation scenarios and fine-tuned on a curated set of real-world data, ensuring robust adaptation to complex scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that A2DO maintains superior localization accuracy and robustness across various degradation conditions, showcasing its potential for practical implementation in autonomous vehicle systems.

### [Tunable Virtual IMU Frame by Weighted Averaging of Multiple Non-Collocated IMUs]()

We present a new method to combine several rigidly connected but physically separated IMUs through a weighted average into a single virtual IMU (VIMU). This has the benefits of (i) reducing process noise through averaging, and (ii) allowing for tuning the location of the VIMU. The VIMU can be placed to be coincident with, for example, a camera frame or GNSS frame, thereby offering a quality-of-life improvement for users. Specifically, our VIMU removes the need to consider any lever-arm terms in the propagation model.	We also present a quadratic programming method for selecting the weights to minimize the noise of the VIMU while still selecting the placement of its reference frame. We tested our method in simulation and validated it on a real dataset. The results show that our averaging technique works for IMUs with large separation and performance gain is observed in both the simulation and the real experiment compared to using only a single IMU.

WildFusion integrates signals from LiDAR, RGB camera, contact microphones, tactile sensors, and IMU. This multimodal fusion generates comprehensive, continuous environmental representations, including pixel-level geometry, color, semantics, and traversability. Through real-world experiments on legged robot navigation in challenging forest environments, WildFusion demonstrates improved route selection by accurately predicting traversability.

### [Steering Prediction Via a Multi-Sensor System for Autonomous Racing]()

Autonomous racing has rapidly gained research attention. Traditionally, racing cars rely on 2D LiDAR as their primary visual system. In this work, we explore the integration of an event camera with the existing system to provide enhanced temporal information. Our goal is to fuse the 2D LiDAR data with event data in an end-to-end learning framework for steering prediction, which is crucial for autonomous racing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing this challenging research topic. We start by creating a multisensor dataset specifically for steering prediction. Using this dataset, we establish a benchmark by evaluating various SOTA fusion methods. Our observations reveal that existing methods often incur substantial computational costs. To address this, we apply low-rank techniques to propose a novel, efficient, and effective fusion design. We introduce a new fusion learning policy to guide the fusion process, enhancing robustness against misalignment. Our fusion architecture provides better steering prediction than LiDAR alone, significantly reducing the RMSE from 7.72 to 1.28. Compared to the second-best fusion method, our work represents only 11% of the learnable parameters while achieving better accuracy. The source code, dataset, and benchmark will be released to promote future research.

### [Are Doppler Velocity Measurements Useful for Spinning Radar Odometry?]()

Spinning, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars with 360 degree coverage have been gaining popularity for autonomous-vehicle navigation. However, unlike 'fixed' automotive radar, commercially available spinning radar systems typically do not produce radial velocities due to the lack of repeated measurements in the same direction and the fundamental hardware setup. To make these radial velocities observable, we modified the firmware of a commercial spinning radar to use triangular frequency modulation. In this paper, we develop a novel way to use this modulation to extract radial Doppler velocity measurements from consecutive azimuths of a radar intensity scan, without any data association. We show that these noisy, error-prone measurements contain enough information to provide good ego-velocity estimates, and incorporate these estimates into different modern odometry pipelines. We extensively evaluate the pipelines on over 110 km of driving data in progressively more geometrically challenging autonomous-driving environments. We show that Doppler velocity measurements improve odometry in well-defined geometric conditions and enable it to continue functioning even in severely geometrically degenerate environments, such as long tunnels.

### [Skater: A Novel Bi-Modal Bi-Copter Robot for Adaptive Locomotion in Air and Diverse Terrain]()

In this letter, we present a novel bi-modal bi-copter robot called Skater, which is adaptable to air and various ground surfaces. Skater consists of a bi-copter moving along its longitudinal direction with two passive wheels on both sides. Using a longitudinally arranged bi-copter as the unified actuation system for both aerial and ground modes, this robot not only keeps a concise and lightweight mechanism but also possesses exceptional terrain traversing capability and strong steering capacity. Moreover, leveraging the vectored thrust characteristic of bi-copters, the Skater can actively generate the centripetal force needed for steering, enabling it to achieve stable movement even on slippery surfaces. Furthermore, we model the comprehensive dynamics of the Skater, analyze its differential flatness, and introduce a controller using nonlinear model predictive control for trajectory tracking. The outstanding performance of the system is verified by extensive real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons.

### [Inverse Kinematics on Guiding Vector Fields for Robot Path Following]()

Inverse kinematics is a fundamental technique for motion and positioning control in robotics, typically applied to end-effectors. In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control. We finish by validating the predicted theoretical results through real flights with fixed-wing drones.

### [Dragonfly Drone: A Novel Tilt-Rotor Aerial Platform with Body-Morphing Capability]()

The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with extended maneuverability has unlocked new applications such as complex inspection tasks at height. In this work, we introduce the Dragonfly drone, a novel tilt-rotor body-morphing UAV, capable of altering its shape and orientation without compromising its position tracking. Unlike most existing UAV designs that only target at decoupling position and orientation control, Dragonfly can also perform unique body-morphing in flight, featuring all six degrees of freedom in every morphology. This enables navigation into tight gaps with irregular shapes, conforming to obstacles of varying geometries, and maintaining physical contact with uneven surfaces. Such capabilities make our design particularly effective for complex inspection tasks at height, such as pipe or bridge inspection. Our contributions include the mechanical design of the system, the modeling and control strategies employed, and the real-robot experiments with a prototype platform. See Dragonfly drone in action: https://youtu.be/YxoV_Qt_5XE.

### [An Omnidirectional Non-Tethered Aerial Prototype with Fixed Uni-Directional Thrusters]()

This paper presents the first worldwide functional prototype omnidirectional multi-rotor aerial vehicle with fixed uni-directional thrusters, with an on-board power source. An optimization algorithm computes the positions and orientations of the propellers in the body frame of the prototype to achieve the omnidirectional capability, while minimizing the platform's weight and the required thrust to hover at any orientation, in addition to other construction requirements. The effect of the aerodynamic interaction between the different propellers is identified experimentally, and the ensuing results are included in the optimization algorithm to avoid such interactions during flight. The prototype's performance is assessed in real experiments demonstrating the decoupling between the forces and moments of the drone, its ability to track concurrently independent positions and orientations, and its ability to hover at a fixed position while rotating.

### [Dense Fixed-Wing Swarming Using Receding-Horizon NMPC]()

In this paper, we present an approach for controlling a team of agile fixed-wing aerial vehicles in close proximity to one another. Our approach relies on receding-horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable inter-agent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach. We successfully demonstrated our approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, and to our knowledge, this the first time close-quarters swarming has been achieved with physical aerobatic fixed-wing vehicles.

### [HPA-MPC: Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors with Suspended Loads]()

Quadrotors equipped with cable-suspended loads represent a versatile, low-cost, and energy efficient solution for aerial transportation, construction, and manipulation tasks. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by several challenges. The system is difficult to control because it is nonlinear, underactuated, involves hybrid dynamics due to slack-taut cable modes, and evolves on complex configuration spaces. Additionally, it is crucial to estimate the full state and the cable’s mode transitions in real-time using on-board sensors and computation. To address these challenges, we present a novel Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HPA-MPC) control approach for quadrotors with suspended loads. Our method considers the complete hybrid system dynamics and includes a perception-aware cost to ensure the payload remains visible in the robot’s camera during navigation. Furthermore, the full state and hybrid dynamics’ transitions are estimated using onboard sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables stable load tracking control, even during slack-taut transitions, and operates entirely onboard. The experiments also show that the perception-aware term effectively keeps the payload in the robot’s camera field of view when a human operator interacts with the load.

### [Unifying Representation and Calibration with 3D Foundation Models]()

Representing the environment is a central challenge in robotics, and is essential for effective decision-making. Traditionally, before capturing images with a manipulator-mounted camera, users need to calibrate the camera using a specific external marker, such as a checkerboard or AprilTag. However, recent advances in computer vision have led to the development of 3D foundation models. These are large, pre-trained neural networks that can establish fast and accurate multi-view correspondences with very few images, even in the absence of rich visual features. This paper advocates for the integration of 3D foundation models into scene representation approaches for robotic systems equipped with manipulator-mounted RGB cameras. Specifically, we propose the Joint Calibration and Representation (JCR) method. JCR uses RGB images, captured by a manipulator-mounted camera, to simultaneously construct an environmental representation and calibrate the camera relative to the robot's end-effector, in the absence of specific calibration markers. The resulting 3D environment representation is aligned with the robot's coordinate frame and maintains physically accurate scales. We demonstrate that JCR can build effective scene representations using a low-cost RGB camera attached to a manipulator, without prior calibration.

### [ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models]()

Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is poten- tially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA – which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training – to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks. We will make our source code and OOD evaluation framework publicly available

### [MonoDiff9D: Monocular Category-Level 9D Object Pose Estimation Via Diffusion Model]()

Object pose estimation is a core means for robots to understand and interact with their environment. For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/MonoDiff9D.

### [A Full-Optical Pre-Touch Dual-Modal and Dual-Mechanism (PDM²) Sensor for Robotic Grasping]()

We report a new full-optical pre-touch dual-modal and dual-mechanism (PDM²) sensor based on an air-coupled fiber-tip surface micromachined optical ultrasound transducer (SMOUT). Compared with the ring-shaped piezoelectric acoustic receivers in previous PDM² sensors, the acoustic signal received by the new fiber-tip SMOUT is readout optically, which is naturally resistant to surrounding electromagnetic interference (EMI) and making the complex grounding and shielding unnecessary. In addition, the new fiber-tip SMOUT receiver has a much smaller size, which makes it possible to further miniaturize the sensor package into a more compact structure. For verification, a prototype of the full-optical PDM² sensor has been designed, fabricated, and characterized. The experimental results show that even with the much smaller acoustic receiver, the new sensor can still achieve comparable ranging and material/structure sensing performances with the previous ones. Therefore, the new full-optical PDM² sensor design is promising to provide a practical and miniaturized solution for ranging and material/structure sensing to assist robotic grasping of unknown objects.

### [Learning Active Tactile Perception through Belief-Space Control]()

Robots operating in an open world will encounter novel objects with unknown physical properties, such as mass, friction, or size. These robots will need to sense these properties through interaction prior to performing downstream tasks with the objects. We propose a method that autonomously learns tactile exploration policies by developing a generative world model that is leveraged to 1) estimate the object's physical parameters using a differentiable Bayesian filtering algorithm and 2) develop an exploration policy using an information-gathering model predictive controller. We evaluate our method on three simulated tasks where the goal is to estimate a desired object property (mass, height or toppling height) through physical interaction. We find that our method is able to discover policies that efficiently gather information about the desired property in an intuitive manner. Finally, we validate our method on a real robot system for the height estimation task, where our method is able to successfully learn and execute an information-gathering policy from scratch.

### [Detection of Fast-Moving Objects with Neuromorphic Hardware]()

Neuromorphic Computing (NC) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in particular are often viewed as the next generation of neural networks. NC is a novel bio-inspired paradigm for energy efficient neural computation, often relying on SNNs in which neurons communicate via spikes in a sparse, event-based manner. This communication via spikes can be exploited by neuromorphic hardware implementations very effectively and results in drastic reductions of energy consumption and latency in contrast to regular GPU-based neural networks. In recent years, neuromorphic hardware has become more accessible and the support of learning frameworks has improved. However, available hardware is partially still experimental, and it is not transparent what these solutions are effectively capable of, how they integrate into real world robotics applications, and how they realistically benefit energy efficiency and latency. In this work, we provide the robotics research community with an overview of what is possible with SNNs on neuromorphic hardware focusing on real-time processing. We introduce a benchmark of three popular neuromorphic hardware devices for the task of event based object detection. Moreover, we show that an SNN on a neuromorphic hardware is able to run in real-time in a closed loop robotic system embedded within a challenging table tennis robot scenario.

### [Grasp, See, and Place: Efficient Unknown Object Rearrangement with Policy Structure Prior]()

We focus on the task of unknown object rearrangement, where a robot is supposed to re-configure the objects into a desired goal configuration specified by an RGB-D image. Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal the noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a decoupled structure is valuable to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we learn a see policy for self-confident in-hand object matching. For the outer loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the foundation model CLIP for object matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher completion rates and fewer steps.

### [LightStereo: Channel Boost Is All You Need for Efficient 2D Cost Aggregation]()

We present LightStereo, a cutting-edge stereo-matching network crafted to accelerate the matching process. Departing from conventional methodologies that rely on aggregating computationally intensive 4D costs, LightStereo adopts the 3D cost volume as a lightweight alternative. While similar approaches have been explored previously, our breakthrough lies in enhancing performance through a dedicated focus on the channel dimension of the 3D cost volume, where the distribution of matching costs is encapsulated. Our exhaustive exploration has yielded plenty of strategies to amplify the capacity of the pivotal dimension, ensuring both precision and efficiency. We compare the proposed LightStereo with existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, which demonstrate its superior performance in speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. LightStereo achieves a competitive EPE metric in the SceneFlow datasets while demanding a minimum of only 22 GFLOPs and 17 ms of runtime, and ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 among real-time models. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the effect of 2D cost aggregation for stereo matching, paving the way for real-world applications of efficient stereo systems. Code is available at https://github.com/XiandaGuo/OpenStereo.

### [SurfaceAug: Toward Versatile, Multimodally Consistent Ground Truth Sampling]()

Despite recent advances in both model architectures and data augmentation, multimodal object detectors still barely outperform their LiDAR-only counterparts. This shortcoming has been attributed to a lack of sufficiently powerful multimodal data augmentation. To address this, we present SurfaceAug, a novel ground truth sampling algorithm. SurfaceAug pastes objects by resampling both images and point clouds, enabling object-level transformations in both modalities. We evaluate our algorithm by training a multimodal detector on KITTI and compare its performance to previous works. We show experimentally that SurfaceAug demonstrates promising improvements on car detection tasks.

### [Uncertainty-Guided Enhancement on Driving Perception System Via Foundation Models]()

Multimodal foundation models offer promising advancements for enhancing driving perception systems, but their high computational and financial costs pose challenges. We develop a method that leverages foundation models to refine predictions from existing driving perception models---such as enhancing object classification accuracy---while minimizing the frequency of using these resource-intensive models. The method quantitatively characterizes uncertainties in the perception model's predictions and engages the foundation model only when these uncertainties exceed a pre-specified threshold. Specifically, it characterizes uncertainty by calibrating the perception model’s confidence scores into theoretical lower bounds on the probability of correct predictions using conformal prediction. Then, it sends images to the foundation model and queries for refining the predictions only if the theoretical bound of the perception model's outcome is below the threshold. Additionally, we propose a temporal inference mechanism that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating historical predictions, leading to tighter theoretical bounds. The method demonstrates a 10 to 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy and reduces the number of queries to the foundation model by 50 percent, based on quantitative evaluations from driving datasets.

### [Complementary Information Guided Occupancy Prediction Via Multi-Level Representation Fusion]()

Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and will be released at https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc.

### [Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation]()

Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, real-world image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field. Code will be released upon publication.

### [Nonlinear Motion-Guided and Spatio-Temporal Aware Network for Unsupervised Event-Based Optical Flow]()

Event cameras have the potential to capture continuous motion information over time and space, making them well-suited for optical flow estimation. However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

### [V2X-DG: Domain Generalization for Vehicle-To-Everything Cooperative Perception]()

LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has demonstrated its impact on the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving. Since current cooperative perception algorithms are trained and tested on the same dataset, the generalization ability of cooperative perception systems remains underexplored. This paper is the first work to study the Domain Generalization problem for LiDAR-based V2X cooperative perception (V2X-DG) based on four widely-used open source datasets: OPV2V, V2XSet, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X. Our research seeks to sustain high performance not only within the source domain but also across other unseen domains, achieved solely through training on source domain. To this end, we propose Cooperative Mixup Augmentation based Generalization (CMAG) to improve the model generalization capability by simulating the unseen cooperation, which is designed compactly for the domain gaps in cooperative perception. Furthermore, we propose a constraint for the regularization of the robust generalized feature representation learning: Cooperation Feature Consistency (CFC), which aligns the intermediately fused features of the generalized cooperation by CMAG and the early fused features of the original cooperation in source domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance gains when generalizing to other unseen datasets while it also maintains strong performance on the source dataset.

### [IMOST: Incremental Memory Mechanism with Online Self-Supervision for Continual Traversability Learning]()

Traversability estimation is the foundation of path planning for a general navigation system. However, complex and dynamic environments pose challenges for the latest methods using self-supervised learning (SSL) technique. Firstly, existing SSL-based methods generate sparse annotations lacking detailed boundary information. Secondly, their strategies focus on hard samples for rapid adaptation, leading to forgetting and biased predictions. In this work, we propose IMOST, a continual traversability learning framework composed of two key modules: incremental dynamic memory (IDM) and self-supervised annotation (SSA). By mimicking human memory mechanisms, IDM allocates novel data samples to new clusters according to information expansion criterion. It also updates clusters based on diversity rule, ensuring a representative characterization of new scene. This mechanism enhances scene-aware knowledge diversity while maintaining a compact memory capacity. The SSA module, integrating FastSAM, utilizes point prompts to generate complete annotations in real time which reduces training complexity. Furthermore, IMOST has been successfully deployed on the quadruped robot, with performance evaluated during the online learning process. Experimental results on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our IMOST outperforms current state-of-the-art method, maintains robust recognition capabilities and adaptability across various scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/SJTU-MKH/OCLTrav.

### [SparseDrive: End-To-End Autonomous Driving Via Sparse Scene Representation]()

The well-established modular autonomous driving system is decoupled into different standalone tasks, e.g. perception, prediction and planning, suffering from information loss and error accumulation across modules. In contrast, end-to-end paradigms unify multi-tasks into a fully differentiable framework, allowing for optimization in a planning-oriented spirit. Despite the great potential of end-to-end paradigms, both the performance and efficiency of existing methods are not satisfactory, particularly in terms of planning safety. We attribute this to the computationally expensive BEV (bird's eye view) features and the straightforward design for prediction and planning. To this end, we explore the sparse representation and review the task design for end-to-end autonomous driving, proposing a new paradigm named SparseDrive. Concretely, SparseDrive consists of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner. The sparse perception module unifies detection, tracking and online mapping with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse representation of the driving scene. For motion prediction and planning, we review the great similarity between these two tasks, leading to a parallel design for motion planner. Based on this parallel design, which models planning as a multi-modal problem, we propose a hierarchical planning selection strategy, which incorporates a collision-aware rescore module, to select a rational and safe trajectory as the final planning output. With such effective designs, SparseDrive surpasses previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin in performance of all tasks, while achieving much higher training and inference efficiency.

### [MOTION TRACKS: A Unified Representation for Human-Robot Transfer in Few-Shot Imitation Learning]()

Teaching robots to autonomously complete everyday tasks remains a challenge. Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks , capture the predicted direction of motion for both human hands and robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-π) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-π completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-π achieves an average success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action space by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos. Code and videos are available on our website (https://portal-cornell.github.io/motion_track_policy/).

### [Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation]()

Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose Discrete Policy, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.

### [AnyCar to Anywhere: Learning Universal Dynamics Model for Agile and Adaptive Mobility]()

Recent works in the robot learning community have successfully introduced generalist models capable of controlling various robot embodiments across a wide range of tasks, such as navigation and locomotion. However, achieving agile control, which pushes the limits of robotic performance, still relies on specialist models that require extensive parameter tuning. To leverage generalist-model adaptability and flexibility while achieving specialist-level agility, we propose AnyCar, a transformer-based generalist dynamics model designed for agile control of various wheeled robots. To collect training data, we unify multiple simulators and leverage different physics backends to simulate vehicles with diverse sizes, scales, and physical properties across various terrains. With robust training and real-world fine-tuning, our model enables precise adaptation to different vehicles, even in the wild and under large state estimation errors. In real-world experiments, AnyCar shows both few-shot and zero-shot generalization across a wide range of vehicles and environments, where our model, combined with a sampling-based MPC, outperforms specialist models by up to 54%. These results represent a key step toward building a foundation model for agile wheeled robot control. AnyCar is fully open-source to support further research.

### [Learning Dynamics of a Ball with Differentiable Factor Graph and Roto-Translational Invariant Representations]()

Robots in dynamic environments need fast, accurate models of how objects move in their environments to support agile planning. In sports such as ping pong, analytical models often struggle to accurately predict ball trajectories with spins due to complex aerodynamics, elastic behaviors, and the challenges of modeling sliding and rolling friction. On the other hand, despite the promise of data-driven methods, machine learning struggles to make accurate, consistent predictions without precise input. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework that can jointly train a dynamics model and a factor graph estimator. Our approach leverages a Gram-Schmidt (GS) process to extract roto-translational invariant representations to improve the model performance, which can further reduce the validation error compared to data augmentation method. Additionally, we propose a network architecture that enhances nonlinearity by using self-multiplicative bypasses in the layer connections. By leveraging these novel methods, our proposed approach predicts the ball's position with an RMSE of 37.2 mm of the paddle radius at the apex after the first bounce, and 71.5 mm after the second bounce.

### [Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Unknown Environments Using Informative Path Planning]()

Semantic segmentation enables robots to perceive and reason about their environments beyond geometry. Most of such systems build upon deep learning approaches. As autonomous robots are commonly deployed in initially unknown environments, pre-training on static datasets cannot always capture the variety of domains and limits the robot’s perception performance during missions. Recently, self-supervised and fully supervised active learning methods emerged to improve robotic vision. These approaches rely on large in-domain pre-training datasets or require substantial human labelling effort. We propose a planning method for semi-supervised active learning of semantic segmentation that substantially reduces human labelling requirements compared to fully supervised approaches. We leverage an adaptive map-based planner guided towards the frontiers of unexplored space with high model uncertainty, collecting training data for human labelling. A key aspect of our approach is to combine the sparse high-quality human labels with pseudo labels automatically extracted from highly certain environment map areas. Experimental results show that our method reaches segmentation performance close to fully supervised approaches with drastically reduced human labelling effort while outperforming self-supervised approaches.

### [FutureNet-LOF: Joint Trajectory Prediction and Lane Occupancy Field Prediction with Future Context Encoding]()

Most prior motion prediction endeavors in autonomous driving have inadequately encoded future scenarios, leading to predictions that may fail to accurately capture the diverse movements of agents (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network for joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2, while it is also the champion method of the CVPR 2024 Argoverse 2 motion forecasting challenge.

### [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Safe Mapless Navigation with Congestion Estimation]()

Reinforcement learning-based mapless navigation holds significant potential. However, it faces challenges in indoor environments with local minima area. This paper introduces a safe mapless navigation framework utilizing hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to enhance navigation through such areas. The high-level policy creates a sub-goal to direct the navigation process. Notably, we have developed a sub-goal update mechanism that considers environment congestion, efficiently avoiding the entrapment of the robot in local minimum areas. The low-level motion planning policy, trained through safe reinforcement learning, outputs real-time control instructions based on acquired sub-goal. Specifically, to enhance the robot's environmental perception, we introduce a new obstacle encoding method that evaluates the impact of obstacles on the robot's motion planning. To validate the performance of our HRL-based navigation framework, we conduct simulations in office, home, and restaurant environments. The findings demonstrate that our HRL-based navigation framework excels in both static and dynamic scenarios. Finally, we implement the HRL-based navigation framework on a TurtleBot3 robot for physical validation experiments, which exhibits its strong generalization capabilities.

### [Hierarchical End-To-End Autonomous Driving: Integrating BEV Perception with Deep Reinforcement Learning]()

End-to-end autonomous driving offers a streamlined alternative to the traditional modular pipeline, integrating perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently gained traction in this domain, existing approaches often overlook the critical connection between feature extraction of DRL and perception. In this paper, we bridge this gap by mapping the DRL feature extraction network directly to the perception phase, enabling clearer interpretation through semantic segmentation. By leveraging Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) representations, we propose a novel DRL-based end-to-end driving framework that utilizes multi-sensor inputs to construct a unified three-dimensional understanding of the environment. This BEV-based system extracts and translates critical environmental features into high-level abstract states for DRL, facilitating more informed control. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach not only enhances interpretability but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in autonomous driving control tasks, reducing the collision rate by 20%. The code of our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/CBDES-e2e/PEDe2e-driving

### [Multi-Goal Motion Memory]()

Autonomous mobile robots (e.g., warehouse logistics robots) often need to traverse complex, obstacle-rich, and changing environments to reach multiple fixed goals (e.g., warehouse shelves). Traditional motion planners need to calculate the entire multi-goal path from scratch in response to changes in the environment, which results in a large consumption of computing resources. This process is not only time-consuming but also may not meet real-time requirements in application scenarios that require rapid response to environmental changes. In this paper, we provide a novel Multi-Goal Motion Memory technique that allows robots to use previous planning experiences to accelerate future multi-goal planning in changing environments. Specifically, our technique predicts collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories and distances between goal pairs to guide the sampling process to build a roadmap, to inform a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver to compute a tour, and to efficiently produce motion plans. Experiments conducted with a vehicle and a snake-like robot in obstacle-rich environments show that the proposed Motion Memory technique can substantially accelerate planning speed by up to 90%. Furthermore, the solution quality is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms and even better in some environments.

### [Dual-BEV Nav: Dual-Layer BEV-Based Heuristic Path Planning for Robotic Navigation in Unstructured Outdoor Environments]()

Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in robotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case of low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected into the global traversability probability map generated by the global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal path. By integrating the traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer BEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to 18.26%. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local BEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall plan

### [Risk-Aware Integrated Task and Motion Planning for Versatile Snake Robots under Localization Failures]()

Snake robots enable mobility through extreme terrains and confined environments in terrestrial and space applications. However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a chance-constrained hybrid partially observable Markov decision process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex mixed integer linear program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and > 50% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.

### [Formation Rotation and Assignment: Avoiding Obstacles in Multi-Robot Scenarios]()

Current formation assignment and optimization methods frequently overlook the influence of rotational dynamics, limiting their operational flexibility. Additionally, these methods typically neglect the impact of obstacles, which may also hinder their effectiveness in obstacle-rich environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach that incorporates both rotation and assignment into the formation optimization of multi-robot systems. This approach allows for dynamic adjustment of the formation orientation and introduces a collaborative obstacle avoidance strategy. This strategy is specifically designed to assess and integrate the influence of obstacles into the optimization process, thereby enhancing the ability to maneuver around obstacles. Simulation experiments, including scenarios involving the encirclement of stationary and moving targets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperforms non-rotational methods in maintaining formations under the influence of various types of obstacles while encircling targets. Furthermore, real-world flight experiments demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the algorithm.

### [A Streamlined Heuristic for the Problem of Min-Time Coverage in Constricted Environments (I)]()

The problem of min-time coverage in constricted environments concerns the employment of robotic fleets to support routine inspection and service operations within well-structured but constricted environments. In our previous work we have provided a detailed definition of this problem, specifying the objectives and the constraints involved, a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for it, a formal analysis of its worst-case computational complexity, and additional structural properties of the optimal solutions that enable a partial relaxation of the original MIP formulation which preserves optimal performance. We have further employed these structural results towards the development of a construction heuristic for this problem. But while the worst-case computational complexity of the construction heuristic is polynomial with respect to the size of the problem-defining elements, its practical scalability has been limited by the requirement to formulate and solve a large number of linear programming formulations. In order to address this issue, this work presents a modified version of the heuristic that significantly reduces the computational times involved. Furthermore, we develop a local search method that further improves the solution obtained from the modified heuristic.

### [Scalable Multi-Agent Surveillance: A Kernel-Based Approach]()

In this work, we address the deployment problem for a team of mobile guards that tries to maintain a line-of-sight with an unpredictable mobile intruder. First, we present a computationally efficient strategy for generating a set of points, called `kernel points`, that covers the entire polygon. We then introduce a polygon partitioning technique based on the location of the kernel points. Next, we propose control laws for a free guard to track an intruder in general polygonal environments based on the analysis of a pursuit-evasion game around a single corner basepaper. Finally, we present several variations of the proposed control laws that include capture and search, and illustrate the improvement in the overall visual footprint of the team of mobile guards based on extensive simulations.

### [Contingency Formation Planning for Interactive Drone Light Shows]()

One of the most appealing applications of drone swarms is drone light shows, in which a group of drones displays an animation by showing a sequence of light patterns in the sky. In this paper, we consider using drone swarms as video game platforms and utilize planning techniques to display pixels in animations correctly while providing a fast response to user inputs. We devise a new sampling algorithm to solve a contingency formation planning problem, which aims to find a contingency formation plan such that drones can always move to the correct positions to display every possible future frame regardless of the user inputs in the future. The algorithm provides interactivity by preemptively relocating hidden drones, which move in stealth mode to the locations of all possible future frames. Our experiments show that the size of the frame buffer and the ratio between the number of drones and the number of pixels can greatly affect the performance of our system.

### [Design of a Formation Control System to Assist Human Operators in Flying a Swarm of Robotic Blimps]()

Formation control is essential for swarm robotics, enabling coordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel formation control system for an indoor blimp swarm using a specialized leader-follower approach enhanced with a dynamic leader-switching mechanism. This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.

### [Multi-Agent Exploration with Similarity Score Map and Topological Memory]()

Multi-robot exploration can be a collaborative solution for navigating a large-scale area. However, it is not trivial to optimally assign tasks among agents because the state dynamically changes while the local observations of multiple agents concurrently update the global map. Furthermore, the individual robots may not have access to accurate relative poses of others or global layouts. We propose an efficient spatial abstraction for multi-agent exploration based on topological graph memories. Each agent creates a topological graph, a lightweight spatial representation whose nodes contain minimal image features. The information in graphs is aggregated to compare individual nodes and is used to update the similarity scores in real-time. Then, the agents effectively fulfill distributed task goals by examining the dynamic similarity scores of frontier nodes. We further exploit extracted visual features to refine the relative poses among topological graphs. Our proposed pipeline can efficiently explore large-scale areas among various scene and robot configurations without sharing precise geometric information.

### [DREAM: Decentralized Real-Time Asynchronous Probabilistic Trajectory Planning for Collision-Free Multi-Robot Navigation in Cluttered Environments]()

Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments with static and dynamic obstacles is essential for many multi-robot tasks.Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities.We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity.We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles.We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings.We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases.Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline.We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.

### [Enhancing the LLM-Based Robot Manipulation through Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity in the field of robotics. However, LLM-based robots are limited to simple, repetitive motions due to the poor integration between language models, robots, and the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLM-based autonomous manipulation through Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The approach involves using a prompted GPT-4 language model to decompose high-level language commands into sequences of motions that can be executed by the robot. The system also employs a YOLO-based perception algorithm, providing visual cues to the LLM, which aids in planning feasible motions within the specific environment. Additionally, an HRC method is proposed by combining teleoperation and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), allowing the LLM-based robot to learn from human guidance. Real-world experiments have been conducted using the Toyota Human Support Robot for manipulation tasks. The outcomes indicate that tasks requiring complex trajectory planning and reasoning over environments can be efficiently accomplished through the incorporation of human demonstrations.

### [In-Context Learning Enables Robot Action Prediction in LLMs]()

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within off-the-shelf LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RobotPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RobotPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

### [UniAff: A Unified Representation of Affordances for Tool Usage and Articulation with Vision-Language Models]()

Previous studies on robotic manipulation are based on a limited understanding of the underlying 3D motion constraints and affordances. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive paradigm, termed UniAff, that integrates 3D object-centric manipulation and task understanding in a unified formulation. Specifically, we constructed a dataset labeled with manipulation-related key attributes, comprising 900 articulated objects from 19 categories and 600 tools from 12 categories. Furthermore, we leverage MLLMs to infer object-centric representations for manipulation tasks, including affordance recognition and reasoning about 3D motion constraints. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings indicate that UniAff significantly improves the generalization of robotic manipulation for tools and articulated objects. We hope that UniAff will serve as a general baseline for unified robotic manipulation tasks in the future. Images, videos, dataset and code are published on the project website at:https://sites.google.com/view/uni-aff/home.

### [ConceptAgent: LLM-Driven Precondition Grounding and Tree Search for Robust Task Planning and Execution]()

Robotic planning and execution in open-world environments is a complex problem due to the vast state spaces and high variability of task embodiment. Recent advances in perception algorithms, combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) for planning, offer promising solutions to these challenges, as the common sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs provide a strong heuristic for efficiently searching the action space. However, prior work fails to address the possibility of hallucinations from LLMs, which results in failures to execute the planned actions largely due to logical fallacies at high- or low-levels. To contend with automation failure due to such hallucinations, we introduce ConceptAgent, a natural language-driven robotic platform designed for task execution in unstructured environments. With a focus on scalability and reliability of LLM-based planning in complex state and action spaces, we present innovations designed to limit these shortcomings, including 1) Predicate Grounding to prevent and recover from infeasible actions, and 2) an embodied version of LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search with self reflection. ConceptAgent combines these planning enhancements with dynamic language aligned 3d scene graphs, and large multi-modal pretrained models to perceive, localize, and interact with its environment, enabling reliable task completion. In simulation experiments, ConceptAgent achieved a 19% task completion rate across three room layouts and 30 easy level embodied tasks outperforming other state-of-the-art LLM-driven reasoning baselines that scored 10.26% and 8.11% on the same benchmark. Additionally, ablation studies on moderate to hard embodied tasks revealed a 20% increase in task completion from the baseline agent to the fully enhanced ConceptAgent, highlighting the individual and combined contributions of Predicate Grounding and LLM-guided Tree Search to enable more robust automation in complex state and action spaces.

### [Towards Generalizable Vision-Language Robotic Manipulation: A Benchmark and LLM-Guided 3D Policy]()

Generalizing language-conditioned robotic policies to new tasks remains a significant challenge, hampered by the lack of suitable simulation benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing GemBench, a novel benchmark to assess generalization capabilities of vision-language robotic manipulation policies. GemBench incorporates seven general action primitives and four levels of generalization, spanning novel placements, rigid and articulated objects, and complex long-horizon tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art approaches on GemBench and also introduce a new method. Our approach 3D-LOTUS leverages rich 3D information for action prediction conditioned on language. While 3D-LOTUS excels in both efficiency and performance on seen tasks, it struggles with novel tasks. To address this, we present 3D-LOTUS++, a framework that integrates 3D-LOTUS's motion planning capabilities with the task planning capabilities of LLMs and the object grounding accuracy of VLMs. 3D-LOTUS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel tasks of GemBench, setting a new standard for generalization in robotic manipulation. Code, dataset, real robot videos and trained models are available at url{https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/gembench/}.

### [Discovering Object Attributes by Prompting Large Language Models with Perception-Action APIs]()

There has been a lot of interest in grounding natural language to physical entities through visual context. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) can ground linguistic instructions to visual sensory information, they struggle with grounding non-visual attributes, like the weight of an object. Our key insight is that non-visual attribute detection can be effectively achieved by active perception guided by visual reasoning. To this end, we present a perception-action API that consists of VLMs and Large Language Models (LLMs) as backbones, together with a set of robot control functions. When prompted with this API and a natural language query, an LLM generates a program to actively identify attributes given an input image. Offline testing on the Odd-One-Out dataset demonstrates that our framework outperforms vanilla VLMs in detecting attributes like relative object location, size, and weight. Online testing in realistic household scenes on AI2-THOR and a real robot demonstration on a DJI RoboMaster EP robot highlight the efficacy of our approach.

### [ExploRLLM: Guiding Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models]()

In robot manipulation, Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from low sample efficiency and uncertain convergence, especially in large observation and action spaces. Foundation Models (FMs) offer an alternative, demonstrating promise in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, they can be unreliable due to limited physical and spatial understanding. We introduce ExploRLLM, a method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. In our approach, FMs improve RL convergence by generating policy code and efficient representations, while a residual RL agent compensates for the FMs' limited physical understanding. We show that ExploRLLM outperforms both policies derived from FMs and RL baselines in table-top manipulation tasks. Additionally, real-world experiments show that the policies exhibit promising zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Supplementary material is available at https://explorllm.github.io .

### [Physical Simulation with Force Feedback Aids Robot Factors Design]()

"Robot factors" design, analogous to ergonomics for humans, seeks to create devices and equipment that can be readily operated by robots, by considering typical capabilities of current robots throughout the design process. While a number of principles and heuristics for robot factors design have been identified, the successful design of hardware operable by autonomous robots often depends in practice on the designer's intuition about robot capabilities, developed through personal experience working with robots. Here we present a tool we have developed to help evaluate a potential device design for usability by a robot, by allowing a designer to in effect teleoperate a virtual robot and attempt the operation of the device. The tool uses a 3D physics-based simulation built in Unity, and a Phantom Omni / Geomagic Touch haptic device that controls the virtual robot's end-effector and provides force feedback. Through user studies, we show that the use of this tool can significantly improve a user's estimation of the suitability of a design for robot operation, in two case studies involving replacing a unit in a modular hardware system and unzipping a canvas bag. By incorporating the use of such a tool early in the design cycle, designers can more effectively develop equipment to be used by autonomous robots without themselves needing direct robotics experience; as a result, robots will be able to take on more tasks in the nearer term with current robot technology.

### [Environmental Map Learning with Multiple-Robots]()

This paper explores decision-making processes in robotic systems tasked with reconstructing scalar fields through sensing in uncertain environments. Each robot must handle noisy perception and operate within specific environmental and physical constraints. The complexity increases in multi-agent scenarios, where robots must not only plan their actions but also anticipate the movements and strategies of other agents. Effective coordination is crucial to prevent collisions and minimize redundant tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an online, distributed multi-robot sampling algorithm that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Gaussian regression. In this approach, each robot iteratively selects its next sampling point while exchanging limited information with other robots and predicting their future actions. Predictions about other robots future actions are computed with a MCTS that is recomputed at each iteration to incorporate all information collected up to that point. We evaluate the performance of our method across diverse environments and team sizes, comparing it to algorithmic alternatives.

### [SLABIM: A SLAM-BIM Coupled Dataset in HKUST Main Building]()

Existing indoor SLAM datasets primarily focus on robot sensing, often lacking building architectures. To address this gap, we design and construct the first dataset to couple the SLAM and BIM, named SLABIM. This dataset provides BIM and SLAM-oriented sensor data, both modeling a university building at HKUST. The as-designed BIM is decomposed and converted for ease of use. We employ a multi-sensor suite for multi-session data collection and mapping to obtain the as-built model. All the related data are timestamped and organized, enabling users to deploy and test effectively. Furthermore, we deploy advanced methods and report the experimental results on three tasks: registration, localization and semantic mapping, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of SLABIM. We make our dataset open-source at https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/SLABIM.

### [Unified Adaptive and Cooperative Planning Using Multi-Task Coregionalized Gaussian Processes]()

For robots tasked with surveying the temporal dynamics of a changing environment, a choice must be made to observe novel regions of the environment or to re-survey previously visited regions, which may have changed. We present a novel multi-robot informative path planner (IPP) that combines an environmental and task kernel to direct mobile robots to gather samples from regions that would result in the greatest expected improvement in map accuracy. Our planner utilizes a multi-output Gaussian process to unify priors about the spatiotemporal environment along with priors about observational correlations between sensing vehicles. Additionally, we extend our analysis into an adaptive planning scenario and examine the performance under different planning configurations. We find that planning performance is largely driven by the choice of environmental priors, and that unrepresentative priors can be improved through adaptive planning.

### [COIGAN: Controllable Object Inpainting through Generative Adversarial Network for Defect Synthesis in Data Augmentation]()

Predictive maintenance is a key aspect for the safety of critical infrastructure such as bridges, dams, and tunnels, where a failure can lead to catastrophic outcomes in terms of human lives and costs. The surge in Artificial Intelligence-driven visual robotic inspection methods necessitates high-quality datasets containing diverse defect classes with several instances on different conditions (e.g., material, illumination). In this context, we introduce a Controllable Object Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network (COIGAN) to synthetically generate realistic images that augment defect datasets. The effectiveness of the model is quantitatively validated by a Fréchet Inception Distance, which measures the similarity between the generated and training samples. To further evaluate the impact of COIGAN-generated images, a segmentation task was conducted, utilizing key performance metrics such as segmentation accuracy, mAP, mIoU, and F1 score, demonstrating that the synthetic images integrate seamlessly and produce results comparable to real defect images. Subsequently, COIGAN generability was successfully used for the segmentation of a defect-free dataset by inpainting defects. The results showcase COIGAN's ability to learn defect patterns and apply them in new contexts, preserving the original features of the base image and allowing the creation of new datasets with a desired multi-class distribution. Specifically, in the context of predictive maintenance, COIGAN enriches datasets, enabling deep learning models to more effectively identify potential infrastructure anomalies.

### [Diffusion Based Robust LiDAR Place Recognition]()

Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of the LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% (threshold 2m) on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.

### [Enhancing Robotic Precision in Construction: A Modular Factor Graph-Based Framework to Deflection and Backlash Compensation Using High-Accuracy Accelerometers]()

Accurate positioning is crucial in the construction industry, where labor shortages highlight the need for automation. Robotic systems with long kinematic chains are required to reach complex workspaces, including floors, walls, and ceilings. These requirements significantly impact positioning accuracy due to effects such as deflection and backlash in various parts along the kinematic chain. In this letter, we introduce a novel approach that integrates deflection and backlash compensation models with high-accuracy accelerometers, significantly enhancing position accuracy. Our method employs a modular framework based on a factor graph formulation to estimate the state of the kinematic chain, leveraging acceleration measurements to inform the model. Extensive testing on publicly released datasets, reflecting real-world construction disturbances, demonstrates the advantages of our approach. The proposed method reduces the 95% error threshold in the xy-plane by 50% compared to the state-of-the-art Virtual Joint Method, and by 31% when incorporating base tilt compensation.

### [Open-Loop Position Control of a Miniature Magnetic Robot Using Two-Dimensional Divergence Control of a Magnetic Force]()

Miniature magnetic robots have attracted considerable attention as promising tools in biomedical applications due to their wireless actuation and precise controllability in a minimally invasive manner. Traditionally, magnetic microrobots have been controlled by globally applied magnetic torques and forces generated by external magnetic actuation systems (MASs), which typically require closed-loop control with real-time vision tracking—a challenging requirement in in-vivo environments. To address this issue, this paper suggests a novel open-loop control scheme for magnetic robots, using two-dimensional (2D) divergence control of a magnetic force generated by stationary electromagnets. Constraint equations for the currents applied to the electromagnets were established to achieve 2D divergence control of a magnetic force. Numerical simulation and experimental validations demonstrate that this approach can generate sufficient magnetic forces that either converge at or diverge from a target point, enabling effective open-loop position control of a miniature magnetic robot. Due to the absence of vision feedback and mechanical motions of magnets, the proposed control strategy could be more clinically applicable for medical applications of magnetic robots.

### [An Equilibrium Analysis of Magnetic Quadrupole Force Field with Applications to Microrobotic Swarm Coordination]()

Controlled microrobots in fluidic environments hold promise for precise drug delivery and cell manipulation, opening new ways for personalized healthcare. However, coordinating magnetic microrobot swarms presents significant challenges due to the complexity of the associated actuation mechanisms. While existing methods to achieve motion differentiation in collections of microrobots rely on design variations among them, the work reported here applies to homogeneous collectives and enables them to be steered as a whole or in fragments, by means of a common externally generated force field. This paper contributes to an emerging set of methods that enable swarm control through manipulation of these force fields. This paper in particular exploits the nature of force field equilibria in a quadrupole workspace configuration as a means of steering the swarm while maintaining its cohesion. The approach also enables splitting the swarm in two subgroups in order to direct each simultaneously to a different location.

### [Ensemble Control of a 2-DOF Parallel Link Arm in a Capsule Robot Using Oscillating External Magnetic Fields]()

Providing oral capsule robots with additional degrees of freedom (DOF), such as robotic arms, is crucial for enhancing their functionality within the body. However, a key challenge arises when using rotating magnetic fields to drive the motor within the robot, as the resulting torque causes the entire capsule to rotate. In this work, we propose a novel approach to actuate a 2 DOF parallel link robot arm integrated into a capsule robot, using external magnetic fields. Our method employs two identical magnetic motors we proposed in a previous study, each driven by an oscillating magnetic field, which alternates direction along a specific axis. By independently controlling the rotation of each motor through the same magnetic field, ensemble control is achieved. The symmetrically arranged motors exhibit different angular velocities, enabling dexterous movement of the robot arm. We further theoretically show that this approach significantly reduces the torque exerted on the robot compared to traditional rotating magnetic fields. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the robot by moving its arms and the attached end-effector along a pre-defined trajectory.

### [Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-Robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation]()

Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.

### [OMASTAR Optimal Magnetic Actuation System Arrangement]()

Microrobots and other miniature robots are able to access millimeter-sized spaces and thus have the potential to solve many challenging problems in healthcare. However, clinical adoption of these robots is rare as these systems are often difficult to scale up. One such issue arises from the actuation systems used to remotely control magnetic microrobots, which tend to be bulky and obstruct the surgeons' workspaces. They also do not guarantee wide ranges of magnetic fields and forces in a large patient-sized workspace. In this paper, we present the design of a permanent magnet-based actuation system that fits within a 40 cm cube of space under an operating table. We also formulate a new set function maximization-based approach for efficiently designing E-optimal magnet arrangements with off-the-shelf convex solvers. Our optimization method is evaluated with synthetic data and a proof-of-concept of the system is simulated.

### [Measuring DNA Microswimmer Locomotion in Complex Flow Environments]()

Microswimmers are sub-millimeter swimming robots that show potential as a platform for controllable locomotion in applications, including targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive surgery. To be viable for these target applications, microswimmers will eventually need to be able to navigate environments with dynamic fluid flows and forces. Experimental studies with microswimmers towards this goal are currently rare because of the difficulty of isolating intentional microswimmer locomotion from environment-induced motion. In this work, we present a method for measuring microswimmer locomotion within a complex flow environment using fiducial microspheres. By tracking the particle motion of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic polystyrene fiducial microspheres, we capture the effect of fluid flow and magnetic field gradients on microswimmer trajectories. We then determine the field-driven translation of these microswimmers relative to fluid flow and demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by illustrating the motion of multiple microswimmers through different flows.

### [Position Regulation of a Conductive Nonmagnetic Object with Two Stationary Field Sources]()

Recent research has shown that eddy currents induced by rotating magnetic dipole fields in conductive nonmagnetic objects can produce forces and torques that enable dexterous manipulation. This paradigm shows promise for application in the remediation of space debris. The induced force from each rotating-magnetic-dipole field source always includes a repulsive component, suggesting that the object should be surrounded by field sources to some degree to ensure the object does not leave the dexterous workspace during manipulation. In this paper, we show that it is possible to fully control the position of an object using just two stationary field sources, provided the object is near the midpoint between the field sources. A given position controller requires a low-level force controller. We propose two new force controllers and compare them with the state-of-the-art method from the literature. One of the new force controllers is particularly good at not inducing parasitic torques, which is hypothesized to be beneficial for future tasks manipulating rotating resident space objects. We perform experimental verification using numerical and physical simulators of microgr

### [From Cognition to Precognition: A Future-Aware Framework for Social Navigation]()

To navigate safely and efficiently in crowded spaces, robots should not only perceive the current state of the environment but also anticipate future human movements. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning architecture, namely Falcon, to tackle socially-aware navigation by explicitly predicting human trajectories and penalizing actions that block future human paths. To facilitate realistic evaluation, we introduce a novel SocialNav benchmark containing two new datasets, Social-HM3D and Social-MP3D. This benchmark offers large-scale photo-realistic indoor scenes populated with a reasonable amount of human agents based on scene area size, incorporating natural human movements and trajectory patterns. We conduct a detailed experimental analysis with the state-of-the-art learning-based method and two classic rule-based path-planning algorithms on the new benchmark. The results demonstrate the importance of future prediction and our method achieves the best task success rate of 55% while maintaining about 90% personal space compliance.	 We will release our code and datasets.

### [OLiVia-Nav: An Online Lifelong Vision Language Approach for Mobile Robot Social Navigation]()

Service robots in human-centered environments such as hospitals, office buildings, and long-term care homes need to navigate while adhering to social norms to ensure the safety and comfortability of the people they are sharing the space with. Furthermore, they need to adapt to new social scenarios that can arise during robot navigation. In this paper, we present a novel Online Lifelong Vision Language architecture, OLiVia-Nav, which uniquely integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with an online lifelong learning framework for robot social navigation. We introduce a unique distillation approach, Social Context Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (SC-CLIP), to transfer the social reasoning capabilities of large VLMs to a lightweight VLM, in order for OLiVia-Nav to directly encode social and environment context during robot navigation. These encoded embeddings are used to generate and select robot social compliant trajectories. The lifelong learning capabilities of SC-CLIP enable OLiVia-Nav to update the robot trajectory planning overtime as new social scenarios are encountered. We conducted extensive real-world experiments in diverse social navigation scenarios. The results showed that OLiVia-Nav outperformed existing state-of-the-art DRL and VLM methods in terms of mean squared error, Hausdorff loss, and personal space violation duration. Ablation studies also verified the design choices for OLiVia-Nav.

### [Arena 4.0: A Comprehensive ROS2 Development and Benchmarking Platform for Human-Centric Navigation Using Generative-Model-Based Environment Generation]()

Building upon the foundations laid by our previous work, this paper introduces Arena 4.0, a significant advancement of Arena 3.0, Arena-Bench, Arena 1.0, and Arena 2.0. Arena 4.0 provides three main novel contributions: 1) a generative-model-based world and scenario generation approach using large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, to dynamically generate complex, human-centric environments from text prompts or 2D floorplans that can be used for development and benchmarking of social navigation strategies. 2) A comprehensive 3D model database which can be extended with 3D assets and semantically linked and annotated using a variety of metrics for dynamic spawning and arrangements inside 3D worlds. 3) The complete migration towards ROS 2, which ensures operation with state-of-the-art hardware and functionalities for improved navigation, usability, and simplified transfer towards real robots. We evaluated the platforms performance through a comprehensive user study and its world generation capabilities for benchmarking demonstrating significant improvements in usability and efficiency compared to previous versions. Arena 4.0 is openly available at https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav.

### [Active Inference-Based Planning for Safe Human-Robot Interaction: Concurrent Consideration of Human Characteristic and Rationality]()

This paper proposes a motion planning strategy for a robot to safely interact with humans exhibiting uncertain actions. The human actions are often encoded by the internal states that are attributed to human characteristics and rationality. First, by leveraging a continuous level of rationality, we compute the belief on human rationality along with his/her characteristic. This systematically reasons out the uncertainty in the observed human action, thereby better assessing the potential safety risks during the interaction. Second, based on the computed belief over the human internal states, we formulate a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) problem to plan the robot’s actions such that it safely achieves its goal while also actively inferring on the human internal state. To cope with the expensive computation of the SMPC, we develop a sampling-based technique that efficiently evaluates the robot’s action conditioned on human uncertainty. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy excels in human action prediction, and significantly improves the safety and efficiency of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

### [Characterizing the Complexity of Social Robot Navigation Scenarios]()

Social robot navigation algorithms are often demonstrated in overly simplified scenarios, prohibiting the extraction of practical insights about their relevance to real-world domains. Our key insight is that an understanding of the inherent complexity of a social robot navigation scenario could help characterize the limitations of existing navigation algorithms and provide actionable directions for improvement. Through an exploration of recent literature, we identify a series of factors contributing to the complexity of a scenario, disambiguating between contextual and robot-related ones. We then conduct a simulation study investigating how manipulations of contextual factors impact the performance of a variety of navigation algorithms. We find that dense and narrow environments correlate most strongly with performance drops, while the heterogeneity of agent policies and directionality of interactions have a less pronounced effect. This motivates a shift towards developing and testing algorithms under higher-complexity settings.

### [Domain Randomization for Learning to Navigate in Human Environments (Resubmission)]()

In shared human-robot environments, effective navigation requires robots to adapt to various pedestrian behaviors encountered in the real world. Most existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for human-aware robot navigation typically assume that pedestrians adhere to a single walking behavior during training, limiting their practicality/performance in scenarios where pedestrians exhibit various types of behavior. In this work, we propose to enhance the generalization capabilities of human-aware robot navigation by employing Domain Randomization (DR) techniques to train navigation policies on a diverse range of simulated pedestrian behaviors with the hope of better generalization to the real world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by comparing the generalization capabilities of a robot navigation policy trained with and without DR, both in simulations and through a real-user study, focusing on adaptability to different pedestrian behaviors, performance in novel environments, and users' perceived comfort, sociability and naturalness. Our findings reveal that the use of DR significantly enhances the robot's social compliance in both simulated and real-life contexts.

### [Characterizing Manipulation Robustness through Energy Margin and Caging Analysis]()

To develop robust manipulation policies, quantifying robustness is essential. Evaluating robustness in general dexterous manipulation, nonetheless, poses significant challenges due to complex hybrid dynamics, combinatorial explosion of possible contact interactions, global geometry, etc. This paper introduces ``caging in motion'', an approach for analyzing manipulation robustness through energy margins and caging-based analysis. Our method assesses manipulation robustness by measuring the energy margin to failure and extends traditional caging concepts for a global analysis of dynamic manipulation. This global analysis is facilitated by a kinodynamic planning framework that naturally integrates global geometry, contact changes, and robot compliance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in the simulation and real-world experiments of multiple dynamic manipulation scenarios, highlighting its potential to predict manipulation success and robustness.

### [Enhancing Adaptivity of Two-Fingered Object Reorientation Using Tactile-Based Online Optimization of Deconstructed Actions]()

Object reorientation is a critical task for robotic grippers, especially when manipulating objects within constrained environments. The task poses significant challenges for motion planning due to the high-dimensional output actions with the complex input information, including unknown object properties and nonlinear contact forces. Traditional approaches simplify the problem by reducing degrees of freedom, limiting contact forms, or acquiring environment/object information in advance—significantly compromising adaptability. To address these challenges, we deconstruct the complex output actions into three fundamental types based on tactile sensing: task-oriented actions, constraint-oriented actions, and coordinating actions. These actions are then optimized online using gradient optimization to enhance adaptability. Key contributions include simplifying contact state perception, decomposing complex gripper actions, and enabling online action optimization for handling unknown objects or environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across a range of everyday objects, regardless of environmental contact. Additionally, the method exhibits robust performance even in the presence of unknown contacts and nonlinear external disturbances.

### [A Full-Cycle Assembly Operation: From Digital Planning to Trajectory Execution Using a Robotic Arm]()

We present an end-to-end framework for planning tight assembly operations, where the input is a set of digital models, and the output is a full execution plan for a physical robotic arm, including the trajectory placement and the grasping. The framework builds on our earlier results on tight assembly planning for free-flying objects and includes the following novel components: (i) the framework itself together with physical demonstrations, (ii) trajectory placement based on novel dynamic pathwise IK and (iii) post processing of the free-flying paths to relax the tightness and smooth the path. The framework provides guarantees as to the quality of the outcome trajectory. For each component we provide the algorithmic details and a full opensource software package for reproducing the process. Lastly, we demonstrate the framework with tight and challenging assembly problems (as well as puzzles, which are planned to be hard to assemble), using a UR5e robotic arm in the real world and in simulation. See the figure at the top for a physical UR5e assembling the alpha-z puzzle (known to be considerably more complicated to assemble than the celebrated alpha puzzle). Full video clips of all the assembly demonstrations together with our open source software are available at our project page: https://tau-cgl.github.io/Full-Cycle-Assembly-Operation/

### [Robust Nonprehensile Dynamic Object Transportation: A Closed-Loop Sensitivity Approach]()

In this paper, we propose a closed-loop sensitivity-based approach to enhance the robustness of robotic nonprehensile dynamic manipulation tasks.The proposed method aims at fulfilling the transportation of an object, that is free to move on a tray-shaped robot end–effector, in face of not perfectly known nominal dynamic parameters. The approach is built up on taking the parameterized reference trajectory to be tracked as the optimization variable minimizing a norm of the system closed-loop sensitivity. The resulting optimal reference trajectory is inherently more robust to the parametric variations of object dynamic properties compared to a baseline straight trajectory execution. The tracking performance is assessed and validated along hardware experiments and an extensive simulation campaign assessing the superior robustness of our approach.

### [Hierarchical Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Multi-Modal Manipulation Using Tight Convex Relaxations]()

Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object & robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot & object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.

### [Constraining Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces for Robot Manipulation Via Dataset Refinement]()

Model-based control faces fundamental challenges in partially-observable environments due to unmodeled obstacles. We propose an online learning and optimization method to identify and avoid unobserved obstacles online. Our method, Constraint Obeying Gaussian Implicit Surfaces (COGIS), infers contact data using a combination of visual input and state tracking, informed by predictions from a nominal dynamics model. We then fit a Gaussian process implicit surface (GPIS) to these data and refine the dataset through a novel method of enforcing constraints on the estimated surface. This allows us to design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that leverages the obstacle estimate to complete multiple manipulation tasks. By modeling the environment instead of attempting to directly adapt the dynamics, our method succeeds at both low-dimensional peg-in-hole tasks and high-dimensional deformable object manipulation tasks. Our method succeeds in 10/10 trials vs 1/10 for a baseline on a real-world cable manipulation task under partial observability of the environment.

### [Optimizing Complex Control Systems with Differentiable Simulators: A Hybrid Approach to Reinforcement Learning and Trajectory Planning]()

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on simulators as abstract oracles to model interactions within complex environments. While differentiable simulators have recently emerged for multi-body robotic systems, they remain underutilized, despite their potential to provide richer information. This underutilization, coupled with the high computational cost of exploration-exploitation in high-dimensional state spaces, limits the practical application of RL in the real-world. We propose a method that integrates learning with differentiable simulators to enhance the efficiency of exploration-exploitation. Our approach learns value functions, state trajectories, and control policies from locally optimal runs of a model-based trajectory optimizer. The learned value function acts as a proxy to shorten the preview horizon, while approximated state and control policies guide the trajectory optimization. We benchmark our algorithm on three classical control problems and a torque-controlled 7 degree-of-freedom robot manipulator arm, demonstrating faster convergence and a more efficient symbiotic relationship between learning and simulation for end-to-end training of complex, poly-articulated systems.

### [TransformerMPC: Accelerating Model Predictive Control Via Transformers]()

In this paper, we address the problem of reducing the computational burden of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for real-time robotic applications. We propose TransformerMPC, a method that enhances the computational efficiency of MPC algorithms by leveraging the attention mechanism in transformers for both online constraint removal and better warm start initialization. Specifically, TransformerMPC accelerates the computation of optimal control inputs by selecting only the active constraints to be included in the MPC problem, while simultaneously providing a warm start to the optimization process. This approach ensures that the original constraints are satisfied at optimality. TransformerMPC is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any solver, irrespective of its implementation. To guarantee constraint satisfaction after removing inactive constraints, we perform an offline verification to ensure that the optimal control inputs generated by the solver meet all constraints. The effectiveness of TransformerMPC is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations on complex robotic systems, achieving up to 35x improvement in runtime without any loss in performance.

### [A New Semidefinite Relaxation for Linear and Piecewise Affine Optimal Control with Time Scaling]()

We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.

### [C-Uniform Trajectory Sampling for Fast Motion Planning]()

We study the problem of sampling robot trajectories and introduce the notion of C-Uniformity. As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.

### [ADMM-MCBF-LCA: A Layered Control Architecture for Safe Real-Time Navigation]()

We consider the problem of safe real-time navigation of a robot in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles of arbitrary smooth geometries and input saturation constraints. We assume that the robot detects and models nearby obstacle boundaries with a short-range sensor and that this detection is error-free. This problem presents three main challenges: i) input constraints, ii) safety, and iii) real-time computation. To tackle all three challenges, we present a layered control architecture (LCA) consisting of an offline path library generation layer, and an online path selection and safety layer. To overcome the limitations of reactive methods, our offline path library consists of feasible controllers, feedback gains, and reference trajectories. To handle computational burden and safety, we solve online path selection and generate safe inputs that run at 100 Hz. Through simulations on Gazebo and Fetch hardware in an indoor environment, we evaluate our approach against baselines that are layered, end-to-end, or reactive. Our experiments demonstrate that among all algorithms, only our proposed LCA is able to complete tasks such as reaching a goal, safely. When comparing metrics such as safety, input error, and success rate, we show that our approach generates safe and feasible inputs throughout the robot execution.

### [Experimental Validation of Sensitivity-Aware Trajectory Planning for a Redundant Robotic Manipulator under Payload Uncertainty]()

In this paper, we experimentally validate the recent concepts of closed-loop state and input sensitivity in the context of robust manipulation control for a robot manipulator. Our objective is to assess how optimizing trajectories with respect to sensitivity metrics can enhance the closed-loop system’s performance w.r.t. model uncertainties, such as those arising from payload variations during precise manipulation tasks. We conduct a series of experiments to validate our optimization approach across different trajectories, focusing primarily on evaluating the precision of the manipulator’s end-effector at critical moments where high accuracy is essential. Our findings offer valuable insights into improving the closed-loop robustness of the robot’s state and inputs against physical parametric uncertainties that could otherwise degrade the system performance.

### [Composite Learning Neural Network Tracking Control of Articulated Soft Robots]()

Controlling articulated soft robots (ASRs) driven by variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) is challenging because they are highly nonlinear and difficult to model accurately. This paper proposes an efficient neural network (NN) learning control solution for ASRs driven by agonistic-antagonistic (AA)-VSAs to guarantee tracking performance without exact robot models. Composite learning resorts to memory regressor extension to enhance adaptive parameter estimation such that parameter convergence can be guaranteed without the stringent condition of persistent excitation. In the proposed method, an NN-based controller is constructed for the position tracking of AA-VSA- driven ASRs, and an NN weight update law based on composite learning is developed to enhance online modeling and control capabilities. Experiments are carried out on an ASR with three degrees of freedom and qbmove Advance actuators (a kind of AA-VSAs), which have validated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in terms of modeling and tracking accuracy compared with existing control methods.

### [Multi-Segment Soft Robot Control Via Deep Koopman-Based Model Predictive Control]()

Soft robots, compared to regular rigid robots, as their multiple segments with soft materials bring flexibility and compliance, have the advantages of safe interaction and dexterous operation in the environment. However, due to its characteristics of high dimensional, nonlinearity, time-varying nature, and infinite degree of freedom, it has been challenges in achieving precise and dynamic control such as trajectory tracking and position reaching. To address these challenges, we propose a framework of Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control (DK-MPC) for handling multi-segment soft robots. We first employ a deep learning approach with sampling data to approximate the Koopman operator, which therefore linearizes the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of the soft robots into a finite-dimensional linear representation. Secondly, this linearized model is utilized within a model predictive control framework to compute optimal control inputs that minimize the tracking error between the desired and actual state trajectories. The real-world experiments on the soft robot “Chordata” demonstrate that DK-MPC could achieve high-precision control, showing the potential of DK-MPC for future applications to soft robots. More visualization results can be found at https://pinkmoon-io.github.io/DKMPC/.

### [Physics-Informed Split Koopman Operators for Data-Efficient Soft Robotic Simulation]()

Koopman operator theory provides a powerful data-driven technique for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems in a linear framework, in comparison to computationally expensive and highly nonlinear physics-based simulations. However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.

### [Robust Swimming Controller for Soft Robots Via Drop-Out Learning]()

A novel framework for training a robotic fish to learn how to swim, even in the presence of degradations or failures in actuators is developed. Robotic underwater robots, particularly soft fish-inspired designs have gained significant attention due to their distinct benefits, including superior maneuverability, energy efficiency, versatile applications, and seamless integration with marine environments. However, their material properties and actuators can degrade, leading to pre-mature system failures. In this paper, we introduce the concept of actuator drop-out during training, to enable the robot to learn how to swim even when one or more actuators are degraded or non-functional. A Soft Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture is used to learn a policy, with actuator degradations/failures introduced during training. A four actuator koi fish is modeled and simulated using the FishGym environment. Navigation-based validation tests show little degradation with one actuator failure, and much more robust swimming behaviors and performance compared to training with no failures, even when two or three actuators fail. These results will improve long-term operational reliability, ensuring robot fish functionality even in challenging underwater conditions.

### [Optimal Gait Control for a Tendon-Driven Soft Quadruped Robot by Model-Based Reinforcement Learning]()

This study presents an innovative approach to optimal gait control for a soft quadruped robot enabled by four compressible tendon-driven soft actuators. Soft quadruped robots, compared to their rigid counterparts, are widely recognized for offering enhanced safety, lower weight, and simpler fabrication and control mechanisms. However, their highly deformable structure introduces nonlinear dynamics, making precise gait locomotion control complex. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method. The study employs a multi-stage approach, including state space restriction, data-driven surrogate model training, and MBRL development. Compared to benchmark methods, the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency and performance of gait control policies. The developed policy is both robust and adaptable to the robot's deformable morphology. The study concludes by highlighting the practical applicability of these findings in real-world scenarios.

### [Physics-Guided Deep Learning Enabled Surrogate Modeling for Pneumatic Soft Robots]()

Soft robots, formulated by soft and compliant materials, have grown significantly in recent years toward safe and adaptable operations and interactions with dynamic environments. Modeling the complex, nonlinear behaviors and controlling the deformable structures of soft robots present challenges. This study aims to establish a physics-guided deep learning (PGDL) computational framework that integrates physical models into deep learning framework as surrogate models for soft robots. Once trained, these models can replace computationally expensive numerical simulations to shorten the computation time and enable real-time control. This PGDL framework is among the first to integrate first principle physics of soft robots into deep learning toward highly accurate yet computationally affordable models for soft robot modeling and control. The proposed framework has been implemented and validated using three different pneumatic soft fingers with different behaviors and geometries, along with two training and testing approaches, to demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. The results showed that the mean square error (MSE) of predicted deformed curvature and the maximum and minimum deformation at various loading conditions were as low as 10−4 mm2. The proposed PGDL framework is constructed from first principle physics and intrinsically can be applicable to various conditions by carefully considering the governing equations, auxiliary equations, and the corresponding boundary and initial conditions.

### [Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Articulated Soft Robots Using Recurrent Neural Networks]()

Soft robots pose difficulties in terms of control, requiring novel strategies to effectively manipulate their compliant structures. Model-based approaches face challenges due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearities such as hysteresis effects. In contrast, learning-based approaches provide nonlinear models of different soft robots based only on measured data. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) predict the behavior of an articulated soft robot (ASR) with five degrees of freedom (DoF). RNNs based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) are compared to the more commonly used long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and show better accuracy. The recurrence enables to capture hysteresis effects that are inherent in soft robots due to viscoelasticity or friction but cannot be captured by simple feedforward networks. The data-driven model is used within a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), whereby the correct handling of the RNN's hidden states is focused. A training approach is presented that allows measured values to be utilized in each control cycle. This enables accurate predictions of short horizons based on sensor data, which is crucial for closed-loop NMPC. The proposed learning-based NMPC enables trajectory tracking with an average error of 1.2 deg in experiments with the pneumatic five-DoF ASR.

### [Towards a Tendon-Assisted Magnetically Steered (TAMS) Robotic Stylet for Brachytherapy]()

Interstitial brachytherapy requires up to 20 straight needles to surround and irradiate deep-seated tumors, but may offer sub-optimal radiation dosage in cases of advanced cancers. A steerable stylet can be used to guide the needle within the tissue, improving procedure accuracy and reducing the number of needles required for each operation. This work introduces the design of a novel tendon-assisted magnetically steered (TAMS) robotic stylet to steer commercially available brachytherapy needles. The dual-actuation modality (magnetic and tendon-driven) allows for increased bending compliance while retaining axial rigidity at extremely small diameters (OD: 1.4 mm), key properties for steering hollow needles from within their lumen. We also develop a two-tube Cosserat rod model that estimates the behavior of the TAMS robot and needle assembly under actuation from tendons, external magnetic fields, and finally combined magnet+tendon forces. We validate our model in free space and demonstrate the capability of the TAMS robot and dual-actuation modalities to steer brachytherapy needles to high curvatures inside phantom tissue.

### [VascularPilot3D: Toward a 3D Fully Autonomous Navigation for Endovascular Robotics]()

This research reports VascularPilot3D, the first 3D fully autonomous endovascular robot navigation system. As an exploration toward autonomous guidewire navigation, VascularPilot3D is developed as a complete navigation system based on intra-operative imaging systems (fluoroscopic X-ray in this study) and typical endovascular robots. VascularPilot3D adopts previously researched fast 3D-2D vessel registration algorithms and guidewire segmentation methods as its perception modules. We additionally propose three modules: a topology-constrained 2D-3D instrument end-point lifting method, a tree-based fast path planning algorithm, and a prior-free endovascular navigation strategy. VascularPilot3D is compatible with most mainstream endovascular robots. Ex-vivo experiments validate that VascularPilot3D achieves 100% success rate among 25 trials. It reduces the human surgeon's overall control loops by 18.38%. VascularPilot3D is promising for general clinical autonomous endovascular navigation.

### [Weakly-Supervised Learning Via Multi-Lateral Decoder Branching for Tool Segmentation in Robot-Assisted Cardiovascular Catheterization]()

Robot-assisted catheterization has garnered a good attention for its potentials in treating cardiovascular diseases. However, advancing surgeon-robot collaboration still requires further research, particularly on task-specific automation. For instance, automated tool segmentation can assist surgeons in visualizing and tracking endovascular tools during procedures. While learning-based models have demonstrated state-of-the- art segmentation performances, generating ground-truth labels for fully-supervised methods is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly. In this study, we developed a weakly-supervised learning method that is based on multi-lateral pseudo labeling for tool segmentation in cardiovascular angiogram datasets. The method utilizes a modified U-Net architecture featuring one encoder and multiple laterally branched decoders. The decoders generate diverse pseudo labels under different perturbations to augment the available partial annotation for model training. A mixed loss function with shared consistency was adapted for this purpose. The weakly-supervised model was trained end-to-end and validated using partially annotated angiogram data from three cardiovascular catheterization procedures. Validation results show that the weakly-supervised model could perform closer to fully-supervised models. Furthermore, the proposed multi-lateral approach outperforms three well known weakly- supervised learning methods, offering the highest segmentation performance across the three angiogram datasets. Numerous ablation studies confirmed the model’s consistent performance under different settings. Finally, the model was applied for tool segmentation in a robot-assisted catheterization experiments. The model enhanced visualization with high connectivity indices for guidewire and catheter, and a mean segmentation time of 35.26ms per frame. This study provides a fast, stable, and less expensive method for tool segmentation and visualization in robotic catheterization.

### [Towards Evaluating the User Comfort and Experience of a Novel Steerable Drilling Robotic System in Pedicle Screw Fixation Procedures: A User Study]()

Aiming at developing a safe, intuitive, and collaborative steerable drilling robotic system for pedicle screw fixation procedures, in this paper, we leverage our recently developed steerable drilling robotic framework, and developed a collaborative drilling mode to control this system. In this control mode, first a user positions a concentric tube steerable drilling robot (CT-SDR) in the workspace and aligns it based on a pre-planned trajectory. Next, the CT-SDR is directly controlled by the user through an admittance mode to perform a drilling procedure and creating a J-shape tunnel. To evaluate the user comfort and intuitiveness of the drilling procedure using this system and the proposed control interface, we performed a user study with 11 subjects, who had no prior experience in using this system. The results of this study were analyzed using various qualitative and quantitative metrics.

### [Minimally Invasive Endotracheal Inside-Out Flexible Needle Driving System towards Microendoscope-Guided Robotic Tracheostomy]()

Open tracheostomy (OT) is considered the traditional way and golden standard for treating airway obstruction patients. However, OT has many unavoidable drawbacks, including strict performing scenarios, significant scarring, and the risk of surgeon infection. Percutaneous dilation tracheostomy (PDT) emerges, with advantages including a lower cost, smaller scarring, and better protection of surgeons from inflecting by aerosol. However, the outside-in puncture manner of PDT has a risk of piercing the post-tracheal wall and the esophagus with uncontrolled force. Additionally, locating tracheal rings and determining the puncture site externally can be challenging for certain patients, such as those who are obese or have undergone neck surgery, while this procedure typically relies on palpation and the surgeon's expertise. Hence, to improve the safety and simplicity of tracheostomy, a minimally-invasive endotracheal inside-out flexible needle-driving system towards microendoscope-guided robotic tracheostomy (MERT) has been proposed in this paper. Guided by an optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe and a microendoscope, the robot inserts into the trachea and performs an inside-out puncture using a flexible needle. The robot can work through a standard endotracheal tube (ETT), and the puncture direction of the flexible needle is variable. Kinematics and statics models of the flexible needle have been derived, and the minimum position errors generated in the kinematics and statics validation experiments are 0.57 pm 0.21 mm and 0.27 pm 0.21 mm. Finally, a porcine trachea puncture experiment is carried out, and the feasibility of the proposed system is verified.

### [Comparison of Classical, Neural Network and Hybrid Models for Hysteretic Single-Tendon Catheter Kinematics]()

While robotic control of catheter motion can improve tip positioning accuracy, hysteresis arising from tendon friction and flexural deformation degrades kinematic modeling accuracy. In this paper, we compare the capabilities of three types of models for representing the forward and inverse kinematic maps of a clinical single-tendon cardiac catheter. Classical hysteresis models, neural networks and hybrid combinations of the two are included. Our results show that modeling accuracy is best when models are trained using motions corresponding to the anticipated clinical motions. For sinusoidal motions, recurrent neural network models provide the best performance. For point-to-point motions, however, a simple backlash model can provide comparable performance to a recurrent neural network.

### [Fieldscale: Locality-Aware Field-Based Adaptive Rescaling for Thermal Infrared Image]()

Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras are emerging as promising sensors in safety-related fields due to their robustness against external illumination. However, RAW TIR image has 14 bits of pixel depth and needs to be rescaled into 8 bits for general applications. Previous works utilize a global 1D look-up table to compute pixel-wise gain solely based on its intensity, which degrades image quality by failing to consider the local nature of the heat. We propose Fieldscale, a rescaling based on locality-aware 2D fields where both the intensity value and spatial context of each pixel within an image are embedded. It can adaptively determine the pixel gain for each region and produce spatially consistent 8-bit rescaled images with minimal information loss and high visibility. Consistent performance improvement on image quality assessment and two other downstream tasks support the effectiveness and usability of Fieldscale. All the codes are publicly opened to facilitate research advancements in this field. https://github.com/hyeonjaegil/fieldscale

### [Evaluating Global Geo-Alignment for Precision Learned Autonomous Vehicle Localization Using Aerial Data]()

Recently there has been growing interest in the use of aerial and satellite map data for autonomous vehicles, primarily due to its potential for significant cost reduction and enhanced scalability. Despite the advantages, aerial data also comes with challenges such as a sensor-modality gap and a viewpoint difference gap. Learned localization methods have shown promise for overcoming these challenges to provide precise metric localization for autonomous vehicles. Most learned localization methods rely on coarsely aligned ground truth, or implicit consistency-based methods to learn the localization task – however, in this paper we find that improving the alignment between aerial data and autonomous vehicle sensor data at training time is critical to the performance of a learning-based localization system. We compare two data alignment methods using a factor graph framework and, using these methods, we then evaluate the effects of closely aligned ground truth on learned localization accuracy through ablation studies. Finally, we evaluate a learned localization system using the data alignment methods on a comprehensive (1600km) autonomous vehicle dataset and demonstrate localization error below 0.3m and 0.5◦ sufficient for autonomous vehicle applications.

### [Under Pressure: Altimeter-Aided ICP for 3D Maps Consistency]()

We propose a novel method to enhance the accuracy of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm by integrating altitude constraints from a barometric pressure sensor. While ICP is widely used in mobile robotics for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), it is susceptible to drift, especially in underconstrained environments such as vertical shafts. To address this issue, we propose to augment ICP with altimeter measurements, reliably constraining drifts along the gravity vector. To demonstrate the potential of altimetry in SLAM, we offer an analysis of calibration procedures and noise sensitivity of various pressure sensors, improving measurements to centimeter-level accuracy. Leveraging this accuracy, we propose a novel ICP formulation that integrates altitude measurements along the gravity vector, thus simplifying the optimization problem to 3-Degree Of Freedom (DOF). Experimental results from real-world deployments demonstrate that our method reduces vertical drift by 84% and improves overall localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods in non-planar environments.

### [Neural Ranging Inertial Odometry]()

Ultra-wideband (UWB) has shown promising potential in GPS-denied localization thanks to its lightweight and drift-free characteristics, while the accuracy is limited in real scenarios due to its sensitivity to sensor arrangement and non-Gaussian pattern induced by multi-path or multi-signal interference, which commonly occurs in many typical applications like long tunnels. We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IR-ULSG in handling challenging conditions, including scenarios outside the convex envelope and cases where only a single anchor is available.

### [Robust Preintegrated Wheel Odometry for Off-Road Autonomous Ground Vehicles]()

Wheel odometry is not often used in state estimation for off-road vehicles due to frequent wheel slippage, varying wheel radii, and the 3D motion of the vehicle not fitting with the 2D nature of integrated wheel odometry. This paper attempts to overcome these issues by proposing a novel 3D preintegration of wheel encoder measurements on manifold. Our method additionally estimates wheel slip, radii, and baseline online to improve accuracy and robustness. Further, due to the preintegration, many measurements can be summarized into a single motion constraint using first-order updates for wheel slippage and intrinsics, allowing for efficient usage in an optimization-based state estimation framework. While our method can be used with any sensors in a factor graph framework, we validate its effectiveness and observability of parameters in a vision-wheel-odometry system (VWO) in a Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, we illustrate its accuracy and demonstrate it can be used to overcome other sensor failures in real-world off-road scenarios in both a VWO and visual-inertial-wheel odometry (VIWO) system.

### [Air-Ground Collaboration with SPOMP: Semantic Panoramic Online Mapping and Planning (I)]()

Mapping and navigation have gone hand-in-hand since long before robots existed. Maps are a key form of communication, allowing someone who has never been somewhere to nonetheless navigate that area successfully. In the context of multirobot systems, the maps and information that flow between robots are necessary for effective collaboration, whether those robots are operating concurrently, sequentially, or completely asynchronously. In this article, we argue that maps must go beyond encoding purely geometric or visual information to enable increasingly complex autonomy, particularly between robots. We propose a framework for multirobot autonomy, focusing in particular on air and ground robots operating in outdoor 2.5-D environments. We show that semantic maps can enable the specification, planning, and execution of complex collaborative missions, including localization in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied settings. A distinguishing characteristic of this work is that we strongly emphasize field experiments and testing, and by doing so demonstrate that these ideas can work at scale in the real world. We also perform extensive simulation experiments to validate our ideas at even larger scales. We believe that these experiments and the experimental results constitute a significant step forward toward advancing the state of the art of large-scale, collaborative multirobot systems operating with real communication, navigation, and perception constraints.

### [Visual-Inertial Localization Leveraging Skylight Polarization Pattern Constraints]()

In this letter, we develop a tightly coupled polarization-visual-inertial localization system that utilizes naturally-attributed polarized skylight to provide a global heading. We introduce a focal plane polarization camera with negligible instantaneous field-of-view error to collect polarized skylight. Then, we design a robust heading determination method from polarized skylight and construct a global stable heading constraint. In particular, this constraint compensates for the heading unobservability present in standard VINS. In addition to the standard sparse visual feature measurements used in VINS, polarization heading residuals are constructed and co-optimized in a tightly-coupled VINS update. An adaptive fusion strategy is designed to correct the cumulative drift. Outdoor real-world experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art VINS-Fusion in terms of localization accuracy, and improves 22% over VINS-Fusion in a wooded campus environment.

### [Promoting Trust in Industrial Human-Robot Collaboration through Preference-Based Optimization]()

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for promoting trust in human-robot collaboration (HRC). The framework exploits Preference-Based Optimization (PBO) and focuses on three key interaction parameters: robot velocity profile, human-robot separation distance, and vertical proximity to the user’s head. By iteratively refining these parameters based on qualitative feedback from human collaborators, the system dynamically adapts robot trajectories. This personalization aims to enhance users’ confidence in the robot’s actions and foster a more trusting collaborative environment. In our user study with fourteen participants, we simulated a chemical industrial scenario for the HRC task. Results suggest that the framework effectively promotes human operator confidence in the robot assistant, particularly for individuals with limited prior experience in robotics.

### [GazeHTA: End-To-End Gaze Target Detection with Head-Target Association]()

Precisely detecting which object a person is paying attention to is critical for human-robot interaction since it provides important cues for the next action from the human user. We propose an end-to-end approach for gaze target detection: predicting a head-target connection between individuals and the target image regions they are looking at. Most of the existing methods use independent components such as off-the-shelf head detectors or have problems in establishing associations between heads and gaze targets. In contrast, we investigate an end-to-end multi-person Gaze target detection framework with Heads and Targets Association (GazeHTA), which predicts multiple head-target instances based solely on input scene image. GazeHTA addresses challenges in gaze target detection by (1) leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model to extract scene features for rich semantic understanding, (2) re-injecting a head feature to enhance the head priors for improved head understanding, and (3) learning a connection map as the explicit visual associations between heads and gaze targets. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that GazeHTA outperforms state-of-the-art gaze target detection methods and two adapted diffusion-based baselines on two standard datasets.

### [Gaze and Go: Harnessing Visual Attention Valence in Upper-Limb Robotic Rehabilitation with Tailored Gamification and Eye Tracking for Neuroplasticity]()

Therapeutic robotic systems have emerged as reliable tools for physical rehabilitation, providing variable-intensity movement assistance to patients with motor impairments. Robot-assisted rehabilitation facilitates the restoration mobility and dexterity, promotes functional neuroplasticity and potentially enables workforce reentry through training-induced cognitive and motor learning. To boost participant engagement and visuomotor coordination, we propose ArmGuider Pro, an advanced upper-limb training system that integrates hand-eye collaboration and gaze-triggered assistance within rehabilitation-tailored serious games. The system implements intuitive eye-tracking and visual-triggering strategies to align therapeutic interventions with participants' intentional focus, incorporating immersive gaming elements and adaptive control algorithms. Experimental validation demonstrates significant activation in motor and cognitive cerebral cortex regions, enhanced visual attention concentration in desired target areas (25.92% improvement), and improved trajectory adherence across sequential sessions (27.27% improvement). By harnessing visual attention valence, our proposed system could encourage neuroplasticity, supporting its viability for clinical application and widespread adaption in rehabilitation regimens.

### [Teleoperating a 6 DoF Robotic Manipulator from Head Movements]()

This article presents an interactive control approach allowing a human user to teleoperate a robotic manipulator located nearby. With this approach, the user keeps his/her hands free, as only head movements are exploited to control the robot. The controller maps the 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) user's head position and orientation into the 6~DoF robot end-effector position and orientation. The robot can reach a large workspace thanks to the combination of two features. Firstly, a virtual wand between the user's head and the robot end-effector converts user's head pan-tilt rotations into large displacements of the robot end-effector center perpendicularly to the wand axis (2 DoF). Secondly, for the remaining 4 DoF (robot end-effector center displacement along the wand axis and robot en-effector orientation), real-time deformation of the virtual wand is triggered when the user reaches uncomfortable configurations due to his/her head workspace limitations. Additionally, the user gets, through an Augmented Reality (AR) Headset, a non-delayed visual feedback of the current virtual wand geometry and location.The paper includes a description of the setup and the proposed controller, detailing how the robot position/orientation is coupled to the user's head position/orientation. A set of elementary experiments with a constant-geometry wand is first presented, showing workspace limitations for some DoF. Then the wand reconfiguration is introduced in the experiments, leading to full control of 6 DoF manipulation tasks throughout a large workspace.

### [Wearable Soft Sensing Band with Stretchable Sensors for Torque Estimation and Hand Gesture Recognition]()

This paper presents a wearable soft sensing band with stretchable sensors for monitoring muscle activity by estimating muscle volume changes. Unlike conventional surface electromyography (sEMG) sensing techniques, which require excessive pressure or adhesive electrodes, the proposed sensing method allows muscle volume variations to be detected simply by placing the device on the skin without additional pressure or adhesives. The band was evaluated in isometric-static and isometric-varying torque estimation tasks, demonstrating superior accuracy to sEMG, with a relative torque to maximum torque estimation error of less than 11.5%. In isometric-varying conditions, relative torque was estimated with an average error of 10.1% at frequencies of 0.1 Hz, 0.2 Hz, and 0.5 Hz. Furthermore, the band achieved a classification accuracy of 92.9% in recognizing ten distinct hand gestures, highlighting its capability to differentiate between multiple muscle activations. The lightweight and flexible design addresses limitations of sEMG, such as signal noise, skin irritation, and complex calibration. Experimental results validate the potential of the proposed sensing method for applications in muscle activity monitoring across healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports, and it also offers potential for use in robot teaching for reference motion generation.

### [Plug-And-Play Multi-Domain Fusion Adaptation for Cross-Subject EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification]()

Motor imagery (MI) classification in rehabilitation brain-computer interfaces (RBCIs) faces significant challenges due to the variability of electroencephalography (EEG) signals across subjects. Existing methods typically require extensive EEG data collection from each new subject, which is time-consuming and results in poor user experience. To address this issue, this paper decompose MI EEG into subject-specific private components and shared components common across all subjects, and propose a plug-and-play domain fusion adaptive method (PPMDFA) to handle variability between subjects. In the training phase, PPMDFA introduces a Multi-Domain Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (MDFGCN) module to extract shared and private features from the MI processes of source domain subjects. In the calibration phase, the method constructs private classifiers for the target new subject using the extracted shared features combined with a small amount of labeled data. During testing, PPMDFA leverages the similarity of private components to utilize knowledge from source subjects, thereby enhancing classification accuracy for target subjects' MI. We validated the proposed method on the PhysioNet and LLMBCImotion datasets. Experimental results show that PPMDFA achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on both datasets, with rapid adaptation to new subjects using only 20% of the data, reaching accuracies of 73.33% and 61.62%, demonstrating strong generalization ability and robustness.

### [Learning to Communicate Functional States with Nonverbal Expressions for Improved Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Collaborative robots must effectively communicate their internal state to humans to enable a smooth interaction. Nonverbal communication is widely used to communicate information during human-robot interaction, however, such methods may also be misunderstood, leading to communication errors. In this work, we explore modulating the acoustic parameter values (pitch bend, beats per minute, beats per loop) of nonverbal auditory expressions to convey functional robot states (accomplished, progressing, stuck). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on noisy human feedback to produce accurately interpreted nonverbal auditory expressions. The proposed approach was evaluated through a user study with 24 participants. The results demonstrate that: (i) Our proposed RL-based approach is able to learn suitable acoustic parameter values which improve the users’ ability to correctly identify the state of the robot. (ii) Algorithm initialization informed by previous user data can be used to significantly speed up the learning process. (iii) The method used for algorithm initialization strongly influences whether participants converge to similar sounds for each robot state. (iv) Modulation of pitch bend has the largest influence on user association between sounds and robotic states.

### [SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models]()

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding; however, they still struggle with spatial understanding, which is fundamental to embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot, a model designed to enhance spatial understanding by utilizing both RGB and depth images. To train VLMs for depth perception, we introduce the SpatialQA and SpatialQA-E datasets, which include multi-level depth-related questions spanning various scenarios and embodiment tasks. SpatialBench is also developed to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' spatial understanding capabilities across different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks, and embodied AI tasks demonstrate the remarkable improvements offered by SpatialBot. The model, code, and datasets are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.

### [Run-Time Observation Interventions Make Vision-Language-Action Models More Visually Robust]()

Vision-language-action (VLA) models trained on large-scale internet data and robot demonstrations have the potential to serve as generalist robot policies. However, despite their large-scale training, VLAs are often brittle to task-irrelevant visual details such as distractor objects or background colors. We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme that (1) dynamically identifies regions of the input image that the model is sensitive to, and (2) minimally alters task-irrelevant regions to reduce the model’s sensitivity using automated image editing tools. Our approach is compatible with any off the shelf VLA without model finetuning or access to the model’s weights. Hardware experiments on language-instructed manipulation tasks demonstrate that BYOVLA enables state-of-the-art VLA models to nearly retain their nominal performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds, which otherwise degrade task success rates by up to 60%.

### [KALIE: Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Open-World Manipulation without Robot Data]()

Building generalist robotic systems involves effectively endowing robots with the capabilities to handle novel objects in an open-world setting. Inspired by the advances of large pre-trained models, we propose Keypoint Affordance Learning from Imagined Environments (KALIE), which adapts pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) for robotic control in a scalable manner. Instead of directly producing motor commands, KALIE controls the robot by predicting point-based affordance representations based on natural language instructions and visual observations of the scene. The VLM is trained on 2D images with affordances labeled by humans, bypassing the need for training data collected on robotic systems. Through an affordance-aware data synthesis pipeline, KALIE automatically creates massive high-quality training data based on limited example data manually collected by humans. We demonstrate that KALIE can learn to robustly solve new manipulation tasks with unseen objects given only 50 example data points. Compared to baselines using pre-trained VLMs, our approach consistently achieves superior performance.

### [GHIL-Glue: Hierarchical Control with Filtered Subgoal Images]()

Image and video generative models that are pre-trained on Internet-scale data can greatly increase the generalization capacity of robot learning systems. These models can function as high-level planners, generating intermediate subgoals for low-level goal-conditioned policies to reach. However, the performance of these systems can be greatly bottlenecked by the interface between generative models and low-level controllers. For example, generative models may predict photo-realistic yet physically infeasible frames that confuse low-level policies. Low-level policies may also be sensitive to subtle visual artifacts in generated goal images. This paper addresses these two facets of generalization, providing an interface to effectively “glue together” language-conditioned image or video prediction models with low-level goal-conditioned policies. Our method, Generative Hierarchical Imitation Learning-Glue (GHIL-Glue), filters out subgoals that do not lead to task progress and improves the robustness of goal-conditioned policies to generated subgoals with harmful visual artifacts. We find in extensive experiments in both simulated and real environments that GHIL-Glue achieves a 25% improvement across several hierarchical models that leverage generative subgoals, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the CALVIN simulation benchmark for policies using observations from a single RGB camera. GHIL-Glue also outperforms other generalist robot policies across 3/4 language-conditioned manipulation tasks testing zero-shot generalization in physical experiments.

### [Simultaneous Localization and Affordance Prediction of Tasks from Egocentric Video]()

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great success as foundational models for downstream vision and natural language applications in a variety of domains. However, these models are limited to reasoning over objects and actions currently visible on the image plane. We present a spatial extension to the VLM, which leverages spatially-localized egocentric video demonstrations to augment VLMs in two ways --- through understanding spatial task-affordances, i.e. where an agent must be for the task to physically take place, and the localization of that task relative to the egocentric viewer. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting representation will enable robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to, or around, physical regions of interest for novel tasks specified in natural language.

### [QUART-Online: Latency-Free Multimodal Large Language Model for Quadruped Robot Learning]()

This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference at 50Hz in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%. Our project page is https://quart-online.github.io.

### [IntelliRMS: A Robotic Manipulation System for Domain-Specific Tasks Using Vision and Language Foundational Models]()

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced machines’ ability to understand and follow human instructions. In many tasks, LLMs have demonstrated performance that rivals human-level common sense. However, directly applying LLMs to domain-specific use cases, such as robotic pick-and-place, remains a challenge. Tasks that are intuitive for humans, who rely on prior knowledge and skills, become complex for robots. Industrial robotic applications like pick-and-place require a high degree of accuracy, often exceeding 90%. In response to these challenges in domain-specific applications, we propose IntelliRMS, a novel system-oriented architecture for instruction-following robotic manipulation. The IntelliRMS synergizes the linguistic and open-vocabulary visual capabilities of foundational models to arrive at an accurate, robust and scalable system. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IntelliRMS in a real-world industrial Bin-picking scenario within the retail sector, validating its performance with a comprehensive dataset.

### [SCA3D: Enhancing Cross-Modal 3D Retrieval Via 3D Shape and Caption Paired Data Augmentation]()

The cross-modal 3D retrieval task aims to achieve mutual matching between text descriptions and 3D shapes. This has the potential to enhance the interaction between natural language and the 3D environment, especially within the realms of robotics and embodied artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, the scarcity and expensiveness of 3D data constrain the performance of existing cross-modal 3D retrieval methods. These methods heavily rely on features derived from the limited number of 3D shapes, resulting in poor generalization ability across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce SCA3D, a novel 3D shape and caption online data augmentation method for cross-modal 3D retrieval. Our approach uses the LLaVA model to create a component library, captioning each segmented part of every 3D shape within the dataset. Notably, it facilitates the generation of extensive new 3D-text pairs containing new semantic features. We employ both inter and intra distances to align various components into a new 3D shape, ensuring that the components do not overlap and are closely fitted. Further, text templates are utilized to process the captions of each component and generate new text descriptions. Besides, we use unimodal encoders to extract embeddings for 3D shapes and texts based on the enriched dataset. We then calculate fine-grained cross-modal similarity using Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and enhance cross-modal matching with contrastive learning, enabling bidirectional retrieval between texts and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments show our SCA3D outperforms previous works on the Text2Shape dataset, raising the Shape-to-Text RR@1 score from 20.03 to 27.22 and the Text-to-Shape RR@1 score from 13.12 to 16.67. Codes can be found in https://github.com/3DAgentWorld/SCA3D.

### [TrajSSL: Trajectory-Enhanced Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection]()

Semi-supervised 3D object detection is a common strategy employed to circumvent the challenge of manually labeling large-scale autonomous driving perception datasets. Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.

### [Single-Shot Metric Depth from Focused Plenoptic Cameras]()

Metric depth estimation from visual sensors is crucial for robots to perceive, navigate, and interact with their environment. Traditional range imaging setups, such as stereo or structured light cameras, face hassles including calibration, occlusions, and hardware demands, with accuracy limited by the baseline between cameras. Single- and multiview monocular depth offers a more compact alternative, but is constrained by the unobservability of the metric scale. Light field imaging provides a promising solution for estimating metric depth by using a unique lens configuration through a single device. However, its application to single-view dense metric depth is under-addressed mainly due to the technology’s high cost, the lack of public benchmarks, and proprietary geometrical models and software. Our work explores the potential of focused plenoptic cameras for dense metric depth. We propose a novel pipeline that predicts metric depth from a single plenoptic camera shot by first generating a sparse metric point cloud using a neural network, which is then used to scale and align a dense relative depth map regressed by a foundation depth model, resulting in a dense metric depth. To validate it, we curated the Light Field & Stereo Image Dataset (LFS) of real-world light field images with stereo depth labels, filling a current gap in existing resources. Experimental results show that our pipeline produces accurate metric depth predictions, laying a solid groundwork for future research in this field.

### [TREND: Tri-Teaching for Robust Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations]()

Preference feedback collected by human or VLM annotators is often noisy, presenting a significant challenge for preference-based reinforcement learning that relies on accurate preference labels. To address this challenge, we propose TREND, a novel framework that integrates few-shot expert demonstrations with a tri-teaching strategy for effective noise mitigation. Our method trains three reward models simultaneously, where each model views its small-loss preference pairs as useful knowledge and teaches such useful pairs to its peer network for updating the parameters. Remarkably, our approach requires as few as one to three expert demonstrations to achieve high performance. We evaluate TREND on various robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 90% success rates even with noise levels as high as 40%, highlighting its effective robustness in handling noisy preference feedback.

### [SYNERGUARD: A Robust Framework for Point Cloud Classification Via Local Geometry and Spatial Topology]()

Point cloud recognition models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The state-of-the-art defense solutions either focus on partial features of the point cloud, limiting their effectiveness, or rely heavily on known adversarial examples, reducing their generalizability, while others, like point cloud reconstruction, will degrade the classifier’s accuracy on clean examples. To address this, we introduce SYNERGUARD, a novel robust point cloud classification framework mitigating adversarial attacks by considering comprehensive geometric and topological attributes of the point cloud, without relying on known adversarial examples while attaining classification accuracies on clean examples. We comprehensively test SYNERGUARD against seven attack types from three leading adversarial attack approaches on two widely used datasets, ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart. The results demonstrate SYNERGUARD’s superiority against existing defenses in mitigating adversarial attacks, as well as managing clean examples.

### [Is Discretization Fusion All You Need for Collaborative Perception?]()

Collaborative perception in multi-agent system enhances overall perceptual capabilities by facilitating the exchange of complementary information among agents. Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized feature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting and transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the informative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection (ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient anchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main components: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor proposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor confidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting only the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global fusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF) and global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF and SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion iteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate ACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the perception range and detection performances. We will make our code available.

### [Tri-AutoAug: Single Domain Generalization for Bird's-Eye-View 3D Object Detection through Pixel-2D-3D Features]()

With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving based on the Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) representation, improving the generalization of such detection models is key for safe real-world applications. However, a realistic yet challenging scenario: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for BEV, is still under-explored. A key ingredient for SDG is to increase data diversity via common image augmentation or adversarial data generation first. However, common image-level augmentation is not sufficient enough to ensure domain diversity in most part of latent space. The adversarial generation has the problem of unstable training or mode collapsing as well. To address these limitations, we present Tri-level Automatic Augmentation (Tri-AutoAug), a simple yet effective method to enlarge the diversity and quantity of data from image and 2D features and facilitate the model to learn more domain-invariant features in BEV space. Besides, Tri-AutoAug can automatically learn augmentation strategies to avoid spending too much time manually adjusting hyperparameters and maximize the benefit of Tri-level Augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore automatic augmentation for SDG BEV. Extensive experiments on NuScenes-C including eight testing domains have demonstrated that our approach can achieve the best performance across various domain generalization methods. More importantly, we evaluate the proposed method in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Tri-AutoAug improves the out-of-distribution (ood) performance by 8.54% (mAP), which demonstrates that Tri-AutoAug provides a practical and feasible solution for the applications of 3D detectors in the real world.The code is available at https://github.com/ClaireTun/Tri-AutoAug.

### [Motion Planning for Minimally-Actuated Serial Robots]()

Modern manipulators are acclaimed for their precision but often struggle to operate in confined spaces. This limitation has driven the development of hyper-redundant and continuum robots. While these present unique advantages, they face challenges in, for instance, weight, mechanical complexity, modeling and costs. The Minimally Actuated Serial Robot (MASR) has been proposed as a light-weight, low-cost and simpler alternative where passive joints are actuated with a Mobile Actuator (MA) moving along the arm. Yet, Inverse Kinematics (IK) and a general motion planning algorithm for the MASR have not be addressed. In this letter, we propose the MASR-RRT* motion planning algorithm specifically developed for the unique kinematics of MASR. The main component of the algorithm is a data-based model for solving the IK problem while considering minimal traverse of the MA. The model is trained solely using the forward kinematics of the MASR and does not require real data. With the model as a local-connection mechanism, MASR-RRT* minimizes a cost function expressing the action time. In a comprehensive analysis, we show that MASR-RRT* is superior in performance to the straight-forward implementation of the standard RRT*. Experiments on a real robot in different environments with obstacles validate the proposed algorithm.

### [Using Implicit Behavior Cloning and Dynamic Movement Primitive to Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for Robot Motion Planning]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) for motion planning of multi-degree-of-freedom robots still suffers from low efficiency in terms of slow training speed and poor generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based robot motion planning framework that uses implicit behavior cloning (IBC) and dynamic movement primitive (DMP) to improve the training speed and generalizability of an off-policy RL agent. IBC utilizes human demonstration data to leverage the training speed of RL, and DMP serves as a heuristic model that transfers motion planning into a simpler planning space. To support this, we also create a human demonstration dataset using a pick-and-place experiment that can be used for similar studies. Comparison studies reveal the advantage of the proposed method over the conventional RL agents with faster training speed and higher scores. A real-robot experiment indicates the applicability of the proposed method to a simple assembly task. Our work provides a novel perspective on using motion primitives and human demonstration to leverage the performance of RL for robot applications.

### [Interpretable Active Inference Gait Control Learning]()

Sustaining the gait locomotion in an adversarial environment requires the robot to react to novel experiences adaptively. In Free Energy Principle (FEP), the behavioral reaction is driven by the discrepancy between observation and prediction. Although, for legged robot gait locomotion, the prediction of gait dynamics is challenging as the consequences non-linearly depend on the activity history, the animal gait is robust, adapting to severe motion disruptions seemingly instantly. In biomimetic robotics, the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) relaxes the general dynamics of body-environment interaction to the stable and repetitive dynamics of gait. Based on these observations, we propose self-learning of the gait dynamics model and FEP framework that infers state estimation and gait control. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on a real hexapod walking robot with 18 controllable degrees of freedom. The robot learns the gait dynamics model indoors and then deploys it in outdoor navigation under various adversarial scenarios. Results show that the developed interpretable gait controller exhibits complex and real-time adaptive behavior when it encounters unknown situations.

### [DOPT: D-Learning with Off-Policy Target Toward Sample Efficiency and Fast Convergence Control]()

In recent times, Lyapunov theory has been incorporated into learning-based control methods to provide a stability guarantee. However, merely satisfying the Lyapunov conditions does not fully leverage the capabilities of the Neural Network (NN) controller. Furthermore, training an effective Lyapunov candidate requires substantial data, which inherently results in sample inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an off-policy variant of the vanilla D-learning method that uses current and historical data to iteratively enhance the NN controller within the framework of Lyapunov theory. Our method outperforms the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and D-learning in terms of stability, sample efficiency, and the quality of the trained controllers and Lyapunov candidates.

### [DFM: Deep Fourier Mimic for Expressive Dance Motion Learning]()

As entertainment robots gain popularity, the demand for natural and expressive motion, particularly in dancing, continues to rise. Traditionally, dancing motions have been manually designed by artists, a process that is both labor-intensive and restricted to simple motion playback,lacking the flexibility to incorporate additional tasks such as locomotion or gaze control during dancing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Deep Fourier Mimic (DFM), a novel method that combines advanced motion representation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable smooth transitions between motions while concurrently managing auxiliary tasks during dance sequences. While previous frequency domain based motion representations have successfully encoded dance motions into latent parameters, they often impose overly rigid periodic assumptions at the local level, resulting in reduced tracking accuracy and motion expressiveness, which is a critical aspect for entertainment robots. By relaxing these locally periodic constraints, our approach not only enhances tracking precision but also facilitates smooth transitions between different motions. Furthermore, the learned RL policy that supports simultaneous base activities, such as locomotion and gaze control, allows entertainment robots to engage more dynamically and interactively with users rather than merely replaying static, pre-designed dance routines.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning with Calibrated Quantile Regression and Evidential Learning]()

We present a novel statistical approach to incorporate uncertainty awareness in model-free distributional deep reinforcement learning for mission and safety-critical robotics. Deep learning predictions are influenced by uncertainties in the data, termed as aleatoric uncertainties, as well as uncertainties in the learning process and model structure, known as epistemic uncertainties. The proposed algorithm, called as Calibrated Evidential Quantile Regression in Deep-Q Networks (CEQR-DQN), addresses key challenges associated with separately estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in stochastic robotic environments. It combines deep evidential learning with quantile calibration based on the principles of conformal inference to provide explicit, sample-free computations of global uncertainty as opposed to local estimates based on simple variance. Thereby, the proposed approach overcomes limitations of traditional methods in computational and statistical efficiency and handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) observations. Tested on a suite of representative miniaturized Atari games (i.e., MinAtar), CEQR-DQN is shown to surpass similar existing frameworks in scores and learning speed. Its ability to rigorously evaluate uncertainties improves exploration strategies and can serve as a blueprint for other uncertainty-aware robotic algorithms.

### [Teaching Periodic Stable Robot Motions Generation Via Sketch]()

Contemporary robots are complex systems. Teaching novel motion patterns to robots requires specialised expertise, often entailing the careful specification of robot motion or the cumbersome design of optimisation problems. In this paper, we seek to simplify the process of generating periodic motions, by teaching robots with user sketches. In particular, we tackle the problem of teaching a robot to approach a surface and then follow cyclic motion on the surface. The limit cycle of the motion can be arbitrarily specified by a single user-provided sketch over an image from the robot’s camera, and the sketched limit cycle is then projected into the scene. To generate motion that converges to the limit cycle, we contribute the Stable Periodic Diagrammatic Teaching (SPDT) framework. SPDT models the robot’s motion as an Orbitally Asymptotically Stable (O.A.S.) dynamical system that learns to stabilise based on the diagrammatic sketch provided by the user. This is achieved by applying a differentiable and invertible function, known as a diffeomorphism, to shape a known O.A.S. system. The parameterised diffeomorphism is then optimised with respect to the Hausdorff distance between the limit cycle of our modelled system and the sketch, to produce the desired robot motion. We provide insight into the behaviour of the optimised system and empirically evaluate SPDT. Results show that we can diagrammatically teach complex cyclic motion patterns with accuracy.

### [DriveSceneGen: Generating Diverse and Realistic Driving Scenarios from Scratch]()

Realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in large quantities are crucial for the development and validation of autonomous driving systems. However, owing to numerous difficulties in the data collection process and the reliance on intensive annotations, real-world datasets lack sufficient quantity and diversity to support the increasing demand for data. This work introduces DriveSceneGen, a data-driven driving scenario generation method that learns from the real-world driving dataset and generates entire dynamic driving scenarios from scratch. Experimental results on 5k generated scenarios highlight that DriveSceneGen is able to generate novel driving scenarios that align with real-world data distributions with high fidelity and diversity. To the best of our knowledge, DriveSceneGen is the first method that generates novel driving scenarios involving both static map elements and dynamic traffic participants from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our two-stage method outperforms existing state-of-the-art map generation methods and trajectory simulation methods on their respective tasks.

### [AMVP: Adaptive Multi-Volume Primitives for Auto-Driving Novel View Synthesis]()

Synthesizing high-quality novel views is critical to extending training data for auto-driving scenes. However, existing novel view synthesis techniques rely on a single-volume radiance field with uniform spatial resolution, constraining their model capacity and resulting in artifacts in synthesized auto-driving views. This paper introduces AMVP, a novel neural representation that models auto-driving scenes using multiple local primitives with adaptive spatial resolution. AMVP addresses the lack of representation capability of detail-rich regions by adaptively subdividing the scene into multiple local volumes. Each local volume is assigned a tailored resolution based on its geometric complexity, as determined by a density prior. Subsequently, multi-volume primitives are introduced to enable sharing a global feature table among local volumes, addressing the GPU memory inefficiency caused by the duplicated allocation. In addition, the paper proposes resolution-aware confidence, a mechanism that suppresses artifacts arising from frequency ambiguity. This mechanism adaptively reduces high-frequency components based on the spatial resolution of each local volume and the distance of the sampling point from the optical center. Experimental results on benchmark auto-driving datasets demonstrate that the proposed AMVP achieves superior rendering quality while using a similar number of parameters compared to existing methods.

### [EMATO: Energy-Model-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Driving]()

Autonomous driving currently lacks robust evidence of energy efficiency when using energy-model-agnostic trajectory planning. To address this, we explore how differential energy models can be effectively utilized under varying driving conditions to enhance energy efficiency. Furthermore, we propose an online nonlinear programming approach that optimizes polynomial trajectories generated by the Frenet polynomial method while incorporating traffic trajectory data and road slope predictions. Through case studies, quantitative analyses, and ablation studies conducted on both sedan and truck models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Task-Oriented Pre-Training for Drivable Area Detection]()

Pre-training techniques play a crucial role in deep learning, enhancing models' performance across a variety of tasks. By initially training on large datasets and subsequently fine-tuning on task-specific data, pre-training provides a solid foundation for models, improving generalization abilities and accelerating convergence rates. This approach has seen significant success in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. However, traditional pre-training methods necessitate large datasets and substantial computational resources, and they can only learn shared features through prolonged training and struggle to capture deeper, task-specific features. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented pre-training method that begins with generating redundant segmentation proposals using the Segment Anything (SAM) model. We then introduce a Specific Category Enhancement Fine-tuning (SCEF) strategy for fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to select proposals most closely related to the drivable area from those generated by SAM. This approach can generate a lot of coarse training data for pre-training models, which are further fine-tuned using manually annotated data, thereby improving model's performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the KITTI road dataset demonstrate that our task-oriented pre-training method achieves an all-around performance improvement compared to models without pre-training. Moreover, our pre-training method not only surpasses traditional pre-training approach but also achieves the best performance compared to state-of-the-art self-training methods.

### [UA-PnP: Uncertainty-Aware End-To-End Bird's Eye View Visual Perception and Prediction for Autonomous Driving]()

Robust and accurate perception and prediction of the driving scenarios are crucial for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). State-of-the-art ADV frameworks have evolved from conventional modular design to an end-to-end (E2E) pipeline that enables joint feature learning and optimization. However, the evaluation of uncertainties in the intermediate features propagated between perception and prediction units is missing in current E2E pipelines. Consequently, adverse and extreme environment factors may incur highly untrustworthy features that ultimately result in degraded perception and prediction. In this work, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware E2E visual perception and prediction framework that utilized Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. A feature distribution estimation network is introduced to explicitly quantify the uncertainties in the intermediate BEV features extracted from the images. To better exploit	temporal information and generate more robust features for scene prediction, an uncertainty-aware transformer is designed to utilize the guidance of the quantified feature uncertainty via the attention mechanism. In addition, an evidential decoder generates accurate future instance segmentations along with the associated uncertainties. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world dataset validate the superiority of our proposed framework over conventional pipelines. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Huang121381/UA-PnP.

### [HGAT-CP: Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Collision Prediction in Autonomous Driving]()

Predicting potential collision events is beneficial to ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Existing graph-based collision prediction methods rely heavily on domain knowledge and predefined semantic relations, limiting their flexibility and adaptability in complex driving scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel collision prediction framework named HGAT-CP, which integrates a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) with a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to model the spatial-temporal interactions in scenes. First, the proposed method employs a data-driven scene graph embedding module to autonomously learn relationships between vehicles and lanes and construct flexible scene graphs. Then, the HGAT module utilizes a dual-level attention mechanism, operating at both the node level and type level, to capture spatial interactions without relying on predefined semantic rules. The LSTM module models temporal dependencies of the scene graph embeddings to improve the prediction of collision events over time. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods across all metrics.

### [SE-STDGNN: A Self-Evolving Spatial-Temporal Directed Graph Neural Network for Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Prediction]()

Vehicle trajectory prediction (VTP) is essential for microscopic traffic risk assessment, autonomous vehicle navigation, and traffic behavior analysis. Related research leveraging learning-based methodologies has yielded notable success on various benchmark trajectory datasets. However, these models often experience performance degradation when faced with dynamic changes in traffic conditions such as vehicle density, road types, and weather conditions, as they have not been exposed to these variations during the training process. To effectively address the need for real-time adaptation in dynamic traffic scenarios, we propose a novel framework titled self-evolving spatial-temporal directed graph neural network (SE-STDGNN). This model utilizes evolving graph convolution networks (EvolveGCNs) to aggregate spatial-temporal features of vehicles and their neighbors, which are then utilized by a trajectory prediction module to forecast future trajectories. Further, a self-evolving mechanism is introduced to adjust model parameters dynamically in the real-time operation. The efficacy of SE STDGNN is validated using the public vehicle trajectory dataset AD4CHE.

### [A Generalized Control Revision Method for Autonomous Driving Safety]()

Safety is one of the most crucial challenges of autonomous driving vehicles, and one solution to guarantee safety is to employ an additional control revision module after the planning backbone. Control Barrier Function (CBF) has been widely used because of its strong mathematical foundation on safety. However, the incompatibility with heterogeneous perception data and incomplete consideration of traffic scene elements make existing systems hard to be applied in dynamic and complex real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce a generalized control revision method for autonomous driving safety, which adopts both vectorized perception and occupancy grid map as inputs and comprehensively models multiple types of traffic scene constraints based on a new proposed barrier function. Traffic elements are integrated into one unified framework, decoupled from specific scenario settings or rules. Experiments on CARLA, SUMO, and OnSite simulator prove that the proposed algorithm could realize safe control revision under complicated scenes, adapting to various planning backbones, road topologies, and risk types. Physical platform validation also verifies the real-world application feasibility.

### [H3-Mapping: Quasi-Heterogeneous Feature Grids for Real-Time Dense Mapping Using Hierarchical Hybrid Representation]()

In recent years, implicit online dense mapping methods have achieved high-quality reconstruction results, showcasing great potential in robotics, AR/VR, and digital twins applications. However, existing methods struggle with slow texture modeling which limits their real-time performance. To address these limitations, we propose a NeRF-based dense mapping method that enables faster and higher-quality reconstruction. To improve texture modeling, we introduce quasi-heterogeneous feature grids, which inherit the fast querying ability of uniform feature grids while adapting to varying levels of texture complexity. Besides, we present a gradient-aided coverage-maximizing strategy for keyframe selection that enables the selected keyframes to exhibit a closer focus on rich-textured regions and a broader scope for weak-textured areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing NeRF-based approaches in texture fidelity, geometry accuracy, and time consumption. The code forour method will be available at: https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/H3-Mapping.

### [CEAR: Comprehensive Event Camera Dataset for Rapid Perception of Agile Quadruped Robots]()

When legged robots perform agile movements, traditional RGB cameras often produce blurred images, posing a challenge for rapid perception. Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution for capturing rapid perception and coping with challenging lighting conditions thanks to their low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, integrating event cameras into agile-legged robots is still largely unexplored. Notably, no dataset including event cameras has yet been developed for the context of agile quadruped robots. To bridge this gap, we introduce CEAR, a dataset comprising data from an event camera, an RGB-D camera, an IMU, a LiDAR, and joint encoders, all mounted on a dynamic quadruped, Mini Cheetah robot. This comprehensive dataset features more than 100 sequences from real-world environments, encompassing various indoor and outdoor environments, different lighting conditions, a range of robot gaits (e.g., trotting, bounding, pronking), as well as acrobatic movements like backflip. To our knowledge, this is the first event camera dataset capturing the dynamic and diverse quadruped robot motions under various setups, developed to advance research in rapid perception for quadruped robots.

### [DVLO4D: Deep Visual-Lidar Odometry with Sparse Spatial-Temporal Fusion]()

Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences.Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.

### [Hier-SLAM: Scaling-Up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting]()

We propose Hier-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hier-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/LeeBY68/Hier-SLAM.

### [CLIP-Clique: Graph-Based Correspondence Matching Augmented by Vision Language Models for Object-Based Global Localization]()

This paper proposes a method of global localization on a map with semantic object landmarks. One of the most promising approaches for localization on object maps is to use semantic graph matching using landmark descriptors calculated from the distribution of surrounding objects. These descriptors are vulnerable to misclassification and partial observations. Moreover, many existing methods rely on inlier extraction using RANSAC, which is stochastic and prone to a high outlier rate. To address the former issue, we augment the correspondence matching using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Landmark discriminability is improved by VLM embeddings, which are independent of surrounding objects. In addition, inliers are estimated deterministically using a graph-theoretic approach. We also incorporate pose calculation using the weighted least squares considering correspondence similarity and observation completeness to improve the robustness. We confirmed improvements in matching and pose estimation accuracy through experiments on ScanNet and TUM datasets.

### [CLOi-Mapper: Consistent, Lightweight, Robust, and Incremental Mapper with Embedded Systems for Commercial Robot Services]()

In commercial autonomous service robots with several form factors, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an essential technology for providing proper services such as cleaning and guidance. Such robots require SLAM algorithms suitable for specific applications and environments. Hence, several SLAM frameworks have been proposed to address various requirements in the past decade. However, we have encountered challenges in implementing recent innovative frameworks when handling service robots with low-end processors and insufficient sensor data, such as low-resolution 2D LiDAR sensors. Specifically, regarding commercial robots, consistent performance in different hardware configurations and environments is more crucial than the performance dedicated to specific sensors or environments. Therefore, we propose a) a multi-stage approach for global pose estimation in embedded systems; b) a graph generation method with zero constraints for synchronized sensors; and c) a robust and memory-efficient method for long-term pose-graph optimization. As verified in in-home and large-scale indoor environments, the proposed method yields consistent global pose estimation for services in commercial fields. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits potential commercial viability consideringthe consistent performance verified via mass production and long-term (> 5 years) operation.

### [D2S: Representing Sparse Descriptors and 3D Coordinates for Camera Relocalization]()

State-of-the-art visual localization methods mostly rely on complex procedures to match local descriptors and 3D point clouds. However, these procedures can incur significant costs in terms of inference, storage, and updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent complex local descriptors and their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a simple outdoor dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in scene-specific generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our approach outperforms the previous regression-based methods in both indoor and outdoor environments. It demonstrates the ability to generalize beyond training data, including scenarios involving transitions from day to night and adapting to domain shifts. The source code, trained models, dataset, and demo videos are available at the following link: https://thpjp.github.io/d2s

### [CAHSOR: Competence-Aware High-Speed Off-Road Ground Navigation in SE(3)]()

While the workspace of traditional ground vehi- cles is usually assumed to be in a 2D plane, i.e., SE(2), such an assumption may not hold when they drive at high speeds on unstructured off-road terrain: High-speed sharp turns on high- friction surfaces may lead to vehicle rollover; Turning aggres- sively on loose gravel or grass may violate the non-holonomic constraint and cause significant lateral sliding; Driving quickly on rugged terrain will produce extensive vibration along the vertical axis. Therefore, most offroad vehicles are currently limited to driving only at low speeds to assure vehicle stability and safety. In this work, we aim at empowering high-speed off-road vehicles with competence awareness in SE(3) so that they can reason about the consequences of taking aggressive maneuvers on different terrain with a 6-DoF forward kino- dynamic model. The kinodynamic model is learned from visual, speed, and inertial Terrain Representation for Off-road Navigation ( TRON ) using multimodal, self-supervised vehicle-terrain interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our Competence-Aware High- Speed Off-Road ( CAHSOR ) navigation approach on a physical ground robot in both autonomous navigation and a human shared-control setup and show that CAHSOR can efficiently reduce vehicle instability by 62% while only compromising 8.6% average speed with the help of TRON .

### [ROD: RGB-Only Fast and Efficient Off-Road Freespace Detection]()

Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS, significantly outperforming prior models. Our code will be available at https://github.com/STLIFE97/offroad_roadseg.

### [JORD: A Benchmark Dataset for Off-Road LiDAR Place Recognition and SLAM]()

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a crucial component of unmanned systems, playing a key role in autonomous navigation. Currently, most LiDAR SLAM methods are focused on structured environments. However, highly irregular off-road terrain poses more challenges for LiDAR SLAM tasks, but these environments are not fully represented in existing datasets. To address this issue, we introduce the first dedicated LiDAR SLAM benchmark dataset for off-road environments, named Jlurobot Off-Road Dadaset (JORD). This dataset is collected using a custom avenger data collection platform in large-scale forest off-road scenes, consisting of 8 LiDAR sequences with a total length of approximately 6.07 kilometers, containing 49,144 point cloud frames along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. The dataset includes multiple revisit information within the sequences, making it suitable for LiDAR place recognition and SLAM tasks. Furthermore, we employe several state-of-the-art methods for benchmarking to validate the dataset's challenges. The release of JORD aims to provide researchers with valuable resources to develop new approaches and explore novel directions for unmanned systems in off-road environments. The complete dataset and code is available at https://github.com/jiurobots/JORD.

### [Self-Reflective Perceptual Adaptation for Robust Ground Navigation in Unstructured Off-Road Environments]()

Autonomous ground robots navigating unstructured off-road environments face perceptual challenges, such as sensor obscuration or failure, which can lead to inaccurate perception or navigation failures. While robot adaptation has recently gained increasing attention, self-reflective robot adaptation, where robots understand and adjust to their own sensor limitations, remains under-explored. This paper proposes a novel approach for self-reflective perceptual adaptation in order to enhance robust off-road navigation. Our approach enables a robot to identify its own perceptual difficulties and dynamically adapt in challenging environments. The key novelty is learning a modality-invariant perceptual representation that encodes shared sensor data into a compact feature space. Within this representation space, the robot's dynamics model is also learned, which enables accurate prediction of future navigation paths. Extensive experiments in off-road environments with sensor obstructions and failures demonstrate that our method significantly improves adaptive capabilities and outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.

### [Dynamics Modeling Using Visual Terrain Features for High-Speed Autonomous Off-Road Driving]()

Rapid autonomous traversal of unstructured ter- rain is essential for scenarios such as disaster response, search and rescue, or planetary exploration. As a vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, high-speed and varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions. In this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a pre- trained visual foundation model (VFM) such as DINOv2, which provides rich features that encode fine-grained semantic infor- mation. To use this dynamics model for planning, we propose an end-to-end training architecture for a projection distance independent feature encoder that compresses the information from the VFM, enabling the creation of a lightweight map of the environment at runtime. We validate our architecture on an extensive dataset (hundreds of kilometers of aggressive off-road driving) collected across multiple locations as part of the DARPA Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program.

### [Digital Twins Meet the Koopman Operator: Data-Driven Learning for Robust Autonomy]()

Contrary to on-road autonomous navigation, off-road autonomy is complicated by various factors ranging from sensing challenges to terrain variability. In such a milieu, data-driven approaches have been commonly employed to capture intricate vehicle-environment interactions effectively. However, the success of data-driven methods depends crucially on the quality and quantity of data, which can be compromised by large variability in off-road environments. To address these concerns, we present a novel methodology to recreate the exact vehicle and its target operating conditions digitally for domain-specific data generation. This enables us to effectively model off-road vehicle dynamics from simulation data using the Koopman operator theory, and employ the obtained models for local motion planning and optimal vehicle control. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through an autonomous navigation problem of a 1:5 scale vehicle, where a terrain-informed planner is employed for global mission planning. Results indicate a substantial improvement in off-road navigation performance with the proposed algorithm (5.84x) and underscore the efficacy of digital twinning in terms of improving the sample efficiency (3.2x) and reducing the sim2real gap (5.2%).

### [Off-Road Freespace Detection with LiDAR-Camera Fusion and Self-Distillation]()

LiDAR-camera fusion has gradually become the mainstream for the freespace detection in unstructured off-road environments. However, existing methods mainly use the traditional method to densify the sparse LiDAR data in the perspective view, which introduces noise and limits the representation ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight end-to-end freespace detection network with cascaded LiDAR-camera fusion and multi-scale self-distillation. It first performs sparse freespace detection in the range view, and then projects the range-view features onto the perspective view and densifies them. The dense features obtained are fused with camera images to get the final freespace detection results. In our method, the cascaded fusion strategy reduces the impact of resolution differences between LiDAR point clouds and camera images, and the introduction of noise during the data densification process. The multi-scale self-distillation strategy distills knowledge from the LiDAR-camera fusion module to the perspective-view module to further improve the freespace detection performance using LiDAR data only. Experiments on the off-road ORFD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cascaded fusion and multi-scale self-distillation strategies, our method obtains 93.4% IoU at speeds of more than 50 Hz. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance among all LiDAR-based freespace detection methods.

### [Learning to Model and Plan for Wheeled Mobility on Vertically Challenging Terrain]()

Most autonomous navigation systems assume wheeled robots are rigid bodies and their 2D planar workspaces can be divided into free spaces and obstacles. However, recent wheeled mobility research, showing that wheeled platforms have the potential of moving over vertically challenging terrain (e.g., rocky outcroppings, rugged boulders, and fallen tree trunks), invalidate both assumptions. Navigating off-road vehicle chassis with long suspension travel and low tire pressure in places where the boundary between obstacles and free spaces is blurry requires precise 3D modeling of the interaction between the chassis and the terrain, which is complicated by suspension and tire deformation, varying tire-terrain friction, vehicle weight distribution and momentum, etc. In this paper, we present a learning approach to model wheeled mobility, i.e., in terms of vehicle-terrain forward dynamics, and plan feasible, stable, and efficient motion to drive over vertically challenging terrain without rolling over or getting stuck. We present physical experiments on two wheeled robots and show that planning using our learned model can achieve up to 60% improvement in navigation success rate and 46% reduction in unstable chassis roll and pitch angles.

### [Dynamic Importance-Weighted Fusion Network Based on Dynamic Convolutions for Hand Posture Recognition: A Technique Based on Red, Green, Blue Plus Depth Cameras]()

Hand posture recognition enhances human-computer interaction, with existing algorithms mainly using RGB images or depth data. However, RGB images are affected by lighting and background, while depth data struggles to capture details, reducing accuracy. To address these issues, fusing RGB images and depth data has gained attention. Traditional fusion methods use fixed modal weights, which struggle to adapt to complex modal relationships, causing performance degradation. To resolve this, we propose a Fusion module incorporating Multi-Scale Gated Extraction (MSGE) for multi-scale feature extraction and gating, Context Sensitive Dynamic Filtering (CSDF) for dynamic weight adjustment based on modal importance, and Importance Weighted Fusion (IWF) for adaptive weighting. Based on this, this paper proposes a network that fuses RGB information and depth data, named Dynamic Importance-Weighted Fusion Network (DIWFNet). This network utilizes a dual-branch YOLOv5 framework integrated with four Fusion modules, fully leveraging the complementary nature of RGB images and depth data. Through dynamic weight distribution and adaptive feature convolution, it precisely captures and models the complex interactions between different modalities, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of hand posture recognition. Our method has shown excellent performance on the CUG dataset, NTU dataset, and self-built dataset, and has been successfully applied to robots in real operational environments.

### [Robust 4D Radar-Aided Inertial Navigation for Aerial Vehicles]()

While LiDAR and cameras are becoming ubiquitous for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but can be ineffective in challenging environments, 4D millimeter-wave (MMW)radars that can provide robust 3D ranging and Doppler velocity measurements are less exploited for aerial navigation. In this paper, we develop an efficient and robust error-state Kalman filter (ESKF)-based radar-inertial navigation for UAVs. The key idea of the proposed approach is the point-to-distribution radar scan matching to provide motion constraints with proper uncertainty qualification, which are used to update the navigation states in a tightly coupled manner, along with the Doppler velocity measurements. Moreover, we propose a robust keyframe-based matching scheme against the prior map to bound the cumulative navigation errors and provide a radar-based global localization solution with high accuracy. Extensive real-world experimental validations have demonstrated that the proposed radar-aided inertial navigation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

### [Semi-Elastic LiDAR-Inertial Odometry]()

This work proposes a semi-elastic optimization-based LiDAR-inertial state estimation method, which balances the constraints from LiDAR, IMU and consistency according to their unique characteristics, thereby imparts appropriate elasticity for current state to be optimized to the correct value, and ensure the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of state estimation. We incorporate the proposed LiDAR-inertial state estimation method into a self-developed optimization-based LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) framework. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of optimization-based LiDAR-inertial state estimation. We have released the source code of this work for the development of the community.

### [DOGE: An Extrinsic Orientation and Gyroscope Bias Estimation for Visual-Inertial Odometry Initialization]()

Most existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) initialization methods rely on accurate pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters. However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.

### [GaRLIO: Gravity Enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry]()

Recently, gravity has been highlighted as a crucial constraint for state estimation to alleviate potential vertical drift. Existing online gravity estimation methods rely on pose estimation combined with IMU measurements, which is considered best practice when direct velocity measurements are unavailable. However, with radar sensors providing direct velocity data—a measurement not yet utilized for gravity estimation—we found a significant opportunity to improve gravity estimation accuracy substantially. GaRLIO, the proposed gravity- enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, can robustly predict gravity to reduce vertical drift while simultaneously enhancing state estimation performance using pointwise velocity measurements. Furthermore, GaRLIO ensures robustness in dynamic environments by utilizing radar to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds. Our method is validated through experiments in various environments prone to vertical drift, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional LiDAR-Inertial Odometry methods. We make our source code publicly available to encourage further research and development. https://github.com/ChiyunNoh/GaRLIO

### [AF-RLIO: Adaptive Fusion of Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Information for Robust Odometry in Challenging Environments]()

In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges, we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules. Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data, constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels. Furthermore, we open source our code at https://github.com/NeSC-IV/AF-RLIO.git to benefit the research community.

### [Adaptive Measurement Model-Based Fusion of Capacitive Proximity Sensor and LiDAR for Improved Mobile Robot Perception]()

This study introduces a novel algorithm that combines a custom-developed capacitive proximity sensor with LiDAR. This integration targets the limitations of using single-sensor systems for mobile robot perception. Our approach deals with the non-Gaussian distribution that arises during the nonlinear transformation of capacitive sensor data into distance measurements. The non-Gaussian distribution resulting from this nonlinear transformation is linearized using a first-order Taylor approximation, creating a measurement model unique to our sensor. This method helps establish a linear relationship between capacitance values and their corresponding distance measurements. Assuming that the capacitance’s standard deviation remains constant, it is modeled as a distance function. By linearizing the capacitance data and synthesizing it with LiDAR data using Gaussian methods, we fuse the sensor information to enhance integration. This results in more precise and robust distance measurements than those obtained through traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) methods. The proposed algorithm is designed for real-time data processing, significantly improving the robot’s state estimation accuracy and stability in various environments. This study offers a reliable method for positional estimation of mobile robots, showcasing outstanding fusion performance in complex settings.

### [Robust Attitude Control with Fixed Exponential Rate of Convergence and Consideration of Motor Dynamics for Tilt Quadrotor Using Quaternions (I)]()

In the existing literature on the robust control design of UAV systems, the controllers are designed without considering motor dynamics. Hence, if these controller gains are not correctly tuned, the system undergoes oscillation and may even go unstable. We have demonstrated this through an experiment in this work. Here, we propose a novel control strategy that considers actuator parameter uncertainties, including motor dynamics for a tilt quadrotor. This strategy is based on the traditional two-loop control scheme where the inner loop controls the angular velocity, and the outer loop controls the vehicle’s attitude based on quaternions. In the quaternion-based controller, usually, the convergence rate increases when the quaternion starts closer to its equilibrium point, thus making it challenging to design a linear controller for the inner loop. To overcome this, we propose a nonlinear control with a varying gain for the outer loop that ensures the quaternion has a fixed convergence rate. We propose the control design of the inner loop, which consists of a disturbance observer (DOB) and a linear controller. The DOB is optimally designed to minimize external disturbances in the presence of model uncertainties. With the DOB, a linear controller is designed for the inner loop, guaranteeing robust stability and performance against the model and actuator parameter uncertainties. The results of experimental flights are reported in this paper.

### [Flying through Moving Gates without Full State Estimation]()

Autonomous drone racing requires powerful perception, planning, and control and has become a benchmark and test field for autonomous, agile flight. Existing work usually assumes static race tracks with known maps, which enables offline planning of time-optimal trajectories, performing localization to the gates to reduce the drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) for state estimation or training learning-based methods for the particular race track and operating environment. In contrast, many real-world tasks like disaster response or delivery need to be performed in unknown and dynamic environments. To make drone racing more robust against unseen environments and moving gates, we propose a control algorithm that operates without a race track map or VIO, relying solely on monocular measurements of the line of sight to the gates. For this purpose, we adopt the law of proportional navigation (PN) to accurately fly through the gates despite gate motions or wind. We formulate the PN-informed vision-based control problem for drone racing as a constrained optimization problem and derive a closed-form optimal solution. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can navigate through moving gates at high speeds while being robust to different gate movements, model errors, wind, and delays.

### [Collapsible Airfoil Single Actuator ROtor-Craft (CASARO) - Construction and Analysis of a Soft Rotary Wing Robot]()

In this paper, a soft rotary wing robot capable of flight and control is presented. The Collapsible Airfoil Single Actuator ROtor-craft (CASARO) is a single actuator monocopter that derives its geometric properties from the Samara seed. CASARO achieves better flight efficiency, lift, and handling ergonomics by reducing its overall volume by 91.7% when collapsed and stowed. Unlike conventional rotorcraft, CASARO uses a non-rigid fabric wing to produce lift in flight. It utilizes the robot’s rotational velocity to maintain tension within its fabric and airframe, providing adequate lift during its hover state. The conception, design, construction, and control of the soft monowing are demonstrated, including its capability to reduce its footprint with its soft fabric construction. To analyze the flight dynamics of CASARO, the craft is flown indoors autonomously, tracking its wing surface, craft body attitude, and position with various step inputs to observe different wing dynamics. CASARO is also capable of being deployed outdoors for real-life human-operated flight.

### [VizFlyt: Perception-Centric Pedagogical Framework for Autonomous Aerial Robots]()

Autonomous aerial robots are becoming commonplace in our lives. Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present VizFlyt, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on VizFlyt for the future. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL experiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and its large potential use cases. Code, datasets, hardware guides and demo videos are available at https://pear.wpi.edu/research/vizflyt.html

### [Distributed Loitering Synchronization with Fixed-Wing UAVs]()

Distributed loitering synchronization is the process whereby a group of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) align with each other while they follow a circular path in the air. This process is essential to establish proper initial conditions for missions in the real world. We evaluate the performance of three synchronization algorithms using a setup of continuously moving fixed-wing drones randomly placed around a loitering circle. We consider the algorithm based on distributed consensus as a baseline. We propose two methods: the Minimum Of Shortest Arc (MOSA) algorithm that outperforms the baseline in this setup and Firefly multi-Pulse Synchronization (FPS), which is inspired by firefly synchronization. The latter method requires 10 times less communication while maintaining a performance comparable to the baseline. These algorithms were first tested in a simple simulation, then a more realistic simulation environment using Gazebo in which fixed-wing dynamics are considered. The proposed algorithms are rigorously tested in simulation through multiple trials involving a group of 10 UAVs, confirming the effectiveness of our approaches. The results were then validated in real flights using 3 fixed-wing drones. Index Terms— Fixed-Wing UAVs, Distributed Synchronization, Multi-Robot Systems, Pulse-Coupled Oscillators

### [A Map-Free Deep Learning-Based Framework for Gate-To-Gate Monocular Visual Navigation Aboard Miniaturized Aerial Vehicles]()

Palm-sized autonomous nano-drones, i.e., sub-50 g in weight, recently entered the drone racing scenario, where they are tasked to avoid obstacles and navigate as fast as possible through gates. However, in contrast with their bigger counterparts, i.e., kg-scale drones, nano-drones expose three orders of magnitude less onboard memory and compute power, demanding more efficient and lightweight vision-based pipelines to win the race. This work presents a map-free vision-based (using only a monocular camera) autonomous nano-drone that combines a real-time deep learning gate detection front-end with a classic yet elegant and effective visual servoing control back-end, only relying on onboard resources. Starting from two state-of-the-art tiny deep learning models, we adapt them for our specific task, and after a mixed simulator-real-world training, we integrate and deploy them aboard our nano-drone. Our best-performing pipeline costs of only 24 M multiply- accumulate operations per frame, resulting in a closed-loop control performance of 30 Hz, while achieving a gate detection root mean square error of 1.4 pixels, on our∼20 k real-world image dataset. In-field experiments highlight the capability of our nano-drone to successfully navigate through 15 gates in 4 min, never crashing and covering a total travel distance of ∼100 m, with a peak flight speed of 1.9 m/s. Finally, to stress the generalization capability of our system, we also test it in a never-seen-before environment, where it navigates through gates for more than 4 min.

### [Agile Fixed-Wing UAVs for Urban Swarm Operations (I)]()

Fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant performance advantages over rotary-wing UAVs in terms of speed, endurance, and efficiency. Such attributes make these vehicles ideally suited for long-range or high-speed reconnaissance operations and position them as valuable complementary members of a heterogeneous multi-robot team. However, these vehicles have traditionally been severely limited with regards to both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) as well as maneuverability, which greatly restricts their utility in environments characterized by complex obstacle fields (e.g., forests or urban centers). This paper describes a set of algorithms and hardware advancements that enable agile fixed-wing UAVs to operate as members of a swarm in complex urban environments. At the core of our approach is a direct nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm that is capable of controlling fixed-wing UAVs through aggressive post-stall maneuvers. We demonstrate in hardware how our online planning and control technique can enable navigation through tight corridors and in close proximity to obstacles. We also demonstrate how our approach can be combined with onboard stereo vision to enable high speed flight in unknown environments. Finally, we describe our method for achieving swarm system integration; this includes a gimballed propeller design to facilitate automatic take-off, a precision deep-stall landing capability, and multi-vehicle collision avoidance.

### [Offline Adaptation of Quadrupeds Using Diffusion Models]()

We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills (modes) and of offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.

### [High-Performance Reinforcement Learning on Spot: Optimizing Simulation Parameters with Distributional Measures]()

This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high-performance reinforcement learning policy deployment with the Spot RL Researcher Development Kit for low-level motor access on Boston Dynamic’s Spot. This represents the first public demonstration of an end-to-end reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on hardware and in simulation to measure our sim-to-real gap. We use these measures as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high-quality reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2m/s locomotion, more than triple Spot’s default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces, disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low-level API.

### [HOVER: Versatile Neural Whole-Body Controller for Humanoid Robots]()

Humanoid whole-body control requires adapting to diverse tasks such as navigation, loco-manipulation, and tabletop manipulation, each demanding a different mode of control. For example, navigation relies on root velocity or position tracking, while tabletop manipulation prioritizes upper-body joint angle tracking. Existing approaches typically train individual policies tailored to a specific command space, limiting their transferability across modes. We present the key insight that full-body kinematic motion imitation can serve as a common abstraction for all these tasks and provide general-purpose motor skills for learning multiple modes of whole-body control. Building on this, we propose HOVER (Humanoid Versatile Controller), a multi-mode policy distillation framework that consolidates diverse control modes into a unified policy. HOVER enables seamless transitions between control modes while preserving the distinct advantages of each, offering a robust and scalable solution for humanoid control across a wide range of modes. By eliminating the need for policy retraining for each control mode, our approach improves efficiency and flexibility for future humanoid applications.

### [Learning Humanoid Locomotion with Perceptive Internal Model]()

In contrast to quadruped robots that can navigate diverse terrains using a "blind" policy, humanoid robots require accurate perception for stable locomotion due to their high degrees of freedom and inherently unstable morphology. However, incorporating perceptual signals often introduces additional disturbances to the system, potentially reducing its robustness, generalizability, and efficiency. This paper presents the Perceptive Internal Model (PIM), which relies on onboard, continuously updated elevation maps centered around the robot to perceive its surroundings. We train the policy using ground-truth obstacle heights surrounding the robot in simulation, optimizing it based on the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM), and perform inference with heights sampled from the constructed elevation map. Unlike previous methods that directly encode depth maps or raw point clouds, our approach allows the robot to perceive the terrain beneath its feet clearly and is less affected by camera movement or noise. Furthermore, since depth map rendering is not required in simulation, our method introduces minimal additional computational costs and can train the policy in 3 hours on an RTX 4090 GPU. We verify the effectiveness of our method across various humanoid robots, various indoor and outdoor terrains, stairs, and various sensor configurations. Our method can enable a humanoid robot to continuously climb stairs and has the potential to serve as a foundational algorithm for the development of future humanoid control methods.

### [A Learning Framework for Diverse Legged Robot Locomotion Using Barrier-Based Style Rewards]()

This work introduces a model-free reinforcement learning framework that enables various modes of motion (quadruped, tripod, or biped) and diverse tasks for legged robot locomotion. We employ a motion-style reward based on a relaxed logarithmic barrier function as a soft constraint, to bias the learning process toward the desired motion style, such as gait, foot clearance, joint position, or body height. The predefined gait cycle is encoded in a flexible manner, facilitating gait adjustments throughout the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KAIST HOUND, a 45 kg robotic system, can achieve biped, tripod, and quadruped locomotion using the proposed framework; quadrupedal capabilities include traversing uneven terrain, galloping at 4.67 m/s, and overcoming obstacles up to 58 cm (67 cm for HOUND2); bipedal capabilities include running at 3.6 m/s, carrying a 7.5 kg object, and ascending stairs-all performed without exteroceptive input.

### [WildLMa: Long Horizon Loco-Manipulation in the Wild]()

`In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims at deploying robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for such an ability for the extended workspace and robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) a learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body tele-operation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or analytical planner and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an LLM planner that interfaces and coordinates these skills. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. We then show these skills can be effectively interfaced with an LLM planner for autonomous long-horizon execution. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.

### [Variable-Frequency Model Learning and Predictive Control for Jumping Maneuvers on Legged Robots]()

Achieving both target accuracy and robustness in dynamic maneuvers with long flight phases, such as high or long jumps, has been a significant challenge for legged robots. To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based control approach consisting of model learning and model predictive control (MPC) utilizing a variable-frequency scheme. Compared to existing MPC techniques, we learn a model directly from experiments, accounting not only for leg dynamics but also for modeling errors and unknown dynamics mismatch in hardware and during contact. Additionally, learning the model with variable-frequency allows us to cover the entire flight phase and final jumping target, enhancing the prediction accuracy of the jumping trajectory. Using the learned model, we also design variable-frequency to effectively leverage different jumping phases and track the target accurately. In a total of 92 jumps on Unitree A1 robot hardware, we verify that our approach outperforms other MPCs using fixed-frequency or nominal model, reducing the jumping distance error 2 to 8 times. We also achieve jumping distance errors of less than 3 percent during continuous jumping on uneven terrain with randomly-placed perturbations of random heights (up to 4 cm or 27 percent of the robot’s standing height). Our approach obtains distance errors of 1cm to 2cm on 34 single and continuous jumps with different jumping targets and model uncertainties. Code is available at https://github.com/DRCL-USC/Learning_MPC_Jumping.

### [Drive with the Flow]()

End-to-end autonomous driving systems have recently made rapid progress, thanks to simulators such as CARLA. They can drive without infraction of common driving rules on uncongested roads but are still struggling with dense traffic scenarios. We conjecture that this occurs because it lacks understanding of the dynamics of the surrounding vehicles, caused by the absence of explicit short-term memory within the perception path of end-to-end models. To address this challenge, we revise the perception module to explicitly model temporal information, by extending it with an auxiliary task that is well-known in computer vision research: optical flow. We generate a novel benchmark using the CARLA simulator to train our model, FlowFuser, and prove its superior ability to avoid collisions with other agents on the road.

### [Potential Fields As Scene Affordance for Behavior Change-Based Visual Risk Object Identification]()

We study behavior change-based visual risk object identification (Visual-ROI), a crucial formulation for Visual-ROI that aims to detect potential hazards for intelligent driving systems. Existing methods often show significant limitations in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, stemming from an incomplete understanding of scene affordance. For example, these methods frequently misidentify vehicles that do not impact the ego vehicle as risk objects. Furthermore, existing behavior change-based methods are inefficient because they implement causal inference in the perspective image space. We propose a new framework with a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representation to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we utilize potential fields as scene affordance, involving repulsive forces derived from road infrastructure and traffic participants, along with attractive forces sourced from target destinations. In this work, we compute potential fields from perspective images by assigning different energy levels based on the semantic labels acquired through BEV semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with various state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show a notable increase in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, with enhancements of 20.3% and 11.6% on the RiskBench dataset, respectively. Additionally, we can improve computational efficiency by 88%. Similarly, on the nuScenes dataset, we achieve improvements of 5.4% and 7.2% in spatial and temporal consistency.

### [SCAM-P: Spatial Channel Attention Module for Panoptic Driving Perception]()

A high-precision, high-efficiency, and lightweight panoptic driving perception system is an essential part of autonomous driving for optimal maneuver planning of the autonomous vehicle. We propose a simple, lightweight, and ef- ficient SCAM-P multi-task learning network that accomplishes three crucial tasks simultaneously for panoptic driving: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane segmentation. To increase the representation power of the shared backbone of our multi-task network, we designed a novel SCAM module with spatially localized channel attention and channel localized spatial attention blocks. SCAM is a lightweight module that can be plugged into any CNN architecture to enhance the semantic features with negligible computational overhead. We integrate our SCAM module and design the SCAM-P network, which has a shared backbone for feature extraction and three independent heads to handle three tasks at the same time. We also designed a nano variant of our SCAM-P network to make it deployment-friendly on edge devices. Our SCAM-P network obtains competitive results on the BDD100K dataset with 81.1 % mAP50 for object detection, 91.6 % mIoU for drivable area segmentation, and 28.8 % IoU for lane segmentation. Our model is robust in various adverse weather conditions, such as rainy, snowy, and at night. Our SCAM-P network not only achieves improved performance but also runs efficiently in real-time at 230.5 FPS on the RTX 4090 GPU and 112.1 FPS on the Jetson Orin edge device.

### [IROAM: Improving Roadside Monocular 3D Object Detection Learning from Autonomous Vehicle Data Domain]()

In autonomous driving, The perception capabilities of the ego-vehicle can be improved with roadside sensors, which can provide a holistic view of the environment. However, existing monocular detection methods designed for vehicle cameras are not suitable for roadside cameras due to viewpoint domain gaps. To bridge this gap and Improve ROAdside Monocular 3D object detection, we propose IROAM, a semantic-geometry decoupled contrastive learning framework, which takes vehicle-side and roadside data as input simultaneously. IROAM has two significant modules. In-Domain Query Interaction module utilizes a transformer to learn content and depth information for each domain and outputs object queries. Cross-Domain Query Enhancement To learn better feature representations from two domains, Cross-Domain Query Enhancement decouples queries into semantic and geometry parts and only the former is used for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IROAM in improving roadside detector’s performance. The results validate that IROAM has the capability to learn cross-domain information.

### [Fast LiDAR Data Generation with Rectified Flows]()

Building LiDAR generative models holds promise as powerful data priors for restoration, scene manipulation, and scalable simulation in autonomous mobile robots. In recent years, approaches using diffusion models have emerged, significantly improving training stability and generation quality. Despite their success, diffusion models require numerous iterations of running neural networks to generate high-quality samples, making the increasing computational cost a potential barrier for robotics applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents R2Flow, a fast and high-fidelity generative model for LiDAR data. Our method is based on rectified flows that learn straight trajectories, simulating data generation with significantly fewer sampling steps compared to diffusion models. We also propose an efficient Transformer-based model architecture for processing the image representation of LiDAR range and reflectance measurements. Our experiments on unconditional LiDAR data generation using the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both efficiency and quality.

### [AmodalSynthDrive: A Synthetic Amodal Perception Dataset for Autonomous Driving]()

Unlike humans, who can effortlessly estimate the entirety of objects even when partially occluded, modern computer vision algorithms still find this aspect extremely challenging. Leveraging this amodal perception for autonomous driving remains largely untapped due to the lack of suitable datasets. The curation of these datasets is primarily hindered by significant annotation costs and mitigating annotator subjectivity in accurately labeling occluded regions. To address these limitations, we introduce AmodalSynthDrive, a synthetic multi-task multi-modal amodal perception dataset. The dataset provides multi-view camera images, 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR data, and odometry for 150 driving sequences with over 1M object annotations in diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. AmodalSynthDrive supports multiple amodal scene understanding tasks including the introduced amodal depth estimation for enhanced spatial understanding. We evaluate several baselines for each of these tasks to illustrate the challenges and set up public benchmarking servers. The dataset is available at http://amodalsynthdrive.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [FedEFM: Federated Endovascular Foundation Model with Unseen Data]()

In endovascular surgery, the precise identification of catheters and guidewires in X-ray images is essential for reducing intervention risks. However, accurately segmenting catheter and guidewire structures is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data. Foundation models offer a promising solution by enabling the collection of similar-domain data to train models whose weights can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Nonetheless, large-scale data collection for training is constrained by the necessity of maintaining patient privacy. This paper proposes a new method to train a foundation model in a decentralized federated learning setting for endovascular intervention. To ensure the feasibility of the training, we tackle the unseen data issue using differentiable Earth Mover's Distance within a knowledge distillation framework. Once trained, our foundation model's weights provide valuable initialization for downstream tasks, thereby enhancing task-specific performance. Intensive experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, contributing to advancements in endovascular intervention and robotic-assisted endovascular surgery, while addressing the critical issue of data sharing in the medical domain.

### [LamPro: Multi-Prototype Representation Learning for Enhanced Visual Pattern Recognition]()

Visual pattern recognition usually plays important roles in robotics and automation society where the pattern recognition relies on representation learning. Existing representation learning often neglects two important issues, the diversity of intra-class representation and under-exploited label utilization, especially the negative feedback during training process. Fortunately, prototype learning potentially raises label utilization and encourages intra-class diversity. In this paper, we investigate the intra-class diversity and effective updates in prototype learning for enhanced visual pattern recognition. Specifically, we propose a Label-aware multi-Prototype learning, LamPro, by incorporating the label awareness into both prototype formation and update to improve the representation quality. Firstly, we design a supervised contrastive learning to achieve class-discriminative representations. Secondly, we randomly initialize multiple prototypes and update the nearest prototype upon the arrival of instance, to preserve intra-class diversity. Thirdly, we propose a novel Label-guided Adaptive Updating. We separate the prototype updates from the representation optimization and exploit the label indexes to directly implement the prediction feedback. To correct the model optimization directions, we identify the negative feedback, and correct the prototype updates via queries of labels. Finally, we design a memory-based counter to alternately update these deviated prototypes. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our label-aware and joint multi-prototype updating strategies.

### [SAS-Prompt: Large Language Models As Numerical Optimizers for Robot Self-Improvement]()

We demonstrate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform iterative self-improvement of robot policies. An important insight of this paper is that LLMs have a built-in ability to perform (stochastic) numerical optimization and that this property can be leveraged for explainable robot policy search. Based on this insight, we introduce the SAS Prompt (Summarize, Analyze, Synthesize) – a single prompt that enables iterative learning and adaptation of robot behavior by combining the LLM’s ability to retrieve, reason and optimize over previous robot traces in order to synthesize new, unseen behavior. Our approach can be regarded as an early example of a new family of explainable policy search methods that are entirely implemented within an LLM. We evaluate our approach both in simulation and on a real-robot table tennis task. Project website: sites.google.com/asu.edu/sas-llm/

### [Cohere3D: Exploiting Temporal Coherence for Unsupervised Representation Learning of Vision-Based Autonomous Driving]()

Multi-frame temporal inputs are important for vision-based autonomous driving. Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D images as long as we can identify the same instance from different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of driving scenes leads to significant variance in the instance appearance and shape captured by the cameras at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance representations robust to the changes of distance and perspective in a long-term temporal sequence without any human annotations. In the pretraining stage, raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the instance-wise long-term temporal correspondence, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level representation from the vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages consistent representation for the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between different instances. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our algorithm by finetuning the pretrained model across key downstream autonomous driving tasks: perception, mapping, prediction, and planning. Results show a notable improvement in both data efficiency and final performance in all these tasks.

### [Towards Open-Ended Robotic Exploration Using Vision-Inspired Similarity and Foundation Models]()

In the domain of robotics, achieving Lifelong Open-ended Learning Autonomy (LOLA) represents a significant milestone, especially in contexts where autonomous agents must adapt to unforeseen environmental variations and evolving objectives. This paper introduces VISOR (Vision-Inspired Similarity for Open-ended Robotic exploration), a vision-based framework designed to assist robotic agents in autonomously exploring and learning from new environments and objects, whether through guided or random exploration, without reliance on predefined design considerations. In that direction, VISOR acts as a perception mediator, classifying everything a robot encounters in a scene as either known or unknown. It further identifies potential distractors (e.g., background elements), known categories, or objects specified through text seeds. By leveraging recent advancements in vision foundation models, VISOR operates in a training-free manner. It begins by segmenting a scene into its constituent entities, regardless of familiarity, and then extracts robust visual representations for each one. These representations are compared against an adaptive memory system that evolves over time; unknown objects are assigned unique IDs and added to this memory as new classes, enriching the robot's understanding of its environment. We argue that this evolving memory can facilitate guided exploration through prior knowledge, enhancing the efficiency of robotic exploration, and validate this by designing two exploration scenarios and running both simulated and real-world experiments.

### [MI-HGNN: Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Legged Robot Contact Perception]()

We present a Morphology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MI-HGNN) for learning-based contact perception. The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/lunarlab-gatech/Morphology-Informed-HGNN.

### [Data-Driven Dynamics Modeling of Miniature Robotic Blimps Using Neural ODEs with Parameter Auto-Tuning]()

Miniature robotic blimps, as one type of lighter-than-air aerial vehicles, have attracted increasing attention in the science and engineering community for their enhanced safety, extended endurance, and quieter operation compared to quadrotors. Accurately modeling the dynamics of these robotic blimps poses a significant challenge due to the complex aerodynamics stemming from their large lifting bodies. Traditional first-principle models have difficulty obtaining accurate aerodynamic parameters and often overlook high-order nonlinearities, thus coming to their limit in modeling the motion dynamics of miniature robotic blimps. To tackle this challenge, this letter proposes the Auto-tuning Blimp-oriented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation method (ABNODE), a data-driven approach that integrates first-principle and neural network modeling. Spiraling motion experiments of robotic blimps are conducted, comparing the ABNODE with first-principle and other data-driven benchmark models, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Improving the Performance of Learned Controllers in Behavior Trees Using Value Function Estimates at Switching Boundaries]()

Behavior trees represent a modular way to create an overall controller from a set of sub-controllers solving different sub-problems. These sub-controllers can be created using various methods, such as classical model based control or reinforcement learning (RL). If each sub-controller satisfies the preconditions of the next sub-controller, the overall controller will achieve the overall goal. However, even if all sub-controllers are locally optimal in achieving the preconditions of the next, with respect to some performance metric such as completiontime, the overall controller might still be far from optimal with respect to the same performance metric. In this paper we show how the performanceof the overall controller can be improved if we use approximations of value functions to inform the design of a sub-controller of the needs of the next one. We also show how, under certain assumptions, this leads to a globally optimal controller when the process is executed on all sub-controllers. Finally, this result also holds when some of the sub-controllers are already given, i.e., if we are constrained to use some existing sub-controllers the overall controller will be globally optimal given this constraint.

### [Deliberative Control-Aware Motion Planning for Kinematic-Constrained UAVs in a Dynamic Environment]()

This paper introduces a motion planning approach for navigating in a dynamic environment. The path is represented using a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) to ensure smoothness, curvature continuity, and proper orientation by adjusting its parameters. A Differential Evolution algorithm optimizes the curve parameters and traversal speed at each re-planning interval, taking into account speed limits, maximum curvature, and obstacles in the environment. A constraint-based on Velocity Obstacle (VO) ensures collision-free motion, considering bounds provided by lower-level controllers. The feasibility of the approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadcopter.

### [Robot Navigation in Unknown and Cluttered Workspace with Dynamical System Modulation in Starshaped Roadmap]()

Compared to conventional decomposition methods that use ellipses or polygons to represent free space, starshaped representation can better capture the natural distribution of sensor data, thereby exploiting a larger portion of traversable space. This paper introduces a novel motion planning and control framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered environments using a dynamically constructed starshaped roadmap. Our approach generates a starshaped representation of the surrounding free space from real-time sensor data using piece-wise polynomials. Additionally, an incremental roadmap maintaining the connectivity information is constructed, and a searching algorithm efficiently selects short-term goals on this roadmap. Importantly, this framework addresses deadend situations with a graph updating mechanism. To ensure safe and efficient movement within the starshaped roadmap, we propose a reactive controller based on Dynamic System Modulation (DSM). This controller facilitates smooth motion within starshaped regions and their intersections, avoiding conservative and short-sighted behaviors and allowing the system to handle intricate obstacle configurations in unknown and cluttered environments. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher success rates and reduced travel times compared to other methods. It effectively manages intricate obstacle configurations, avoiding conservative and myopic behaviors.

### [Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving Via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion Predictions]()

We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.

### [Autonomous Navigation in Ice-Covered Waters with Learned Predictions on Ship-Ice Interactions]()

Autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters poses significant challenges due to the frequent lack of viable collision-free trajectories. When complete obstacle avoidance is infeasible, it becomes imperative for the navigation strategy to minimize collisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ice, which moves in response to ship maneuvers, complicates the path planning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model to estimate the coarse dynamics of ice movements triggered by ship actions through occupancy estimation. To ensure real-time applicability, we propose a novel approach that caches intermediate prediction results and seamlessly integrates the predictive model into a graph search planner. We evaluate the proposed planner in both simulation and in a physical testbed against existing approaches and show that our planner significantly reduces collisions with ice when compared to the state-of-the-art. Codes and demos of this work are available at https://github.com/IvanIZ/predictive-asv-planner.

### [IKap: Kinematics-Aware Planning with Imperative Learning]()

Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems have gained increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly works with various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex environments.

### [Differentiable-Optimization Based Neural Policy for Occlusion-Aware Target Tracking]()

We propose a learned probabilistic neural policy for safe, occlusion-free target tracking. The core novelty of our work stems from the structure of our policy network that combines generative modeling based on Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with differentiable optimization layers. The weights of the CVAE network and the parameters of the differentiable optimization can be learned in an end-to-end fashion through demonstration trajectories. We improve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the following respects. We show that our learned policy outperforms existing SOTA in terms of occlusion/collision avoidance capabilities and computation time. Second, we present an extensive ablation showing how different components of our learning pipeline contribute to the overall tracking task. We also demonstrate the real-time performance of our approach on resource-constrained hardware such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Finally, our learned policy can also be viewed as a reactive planner for navigation in highly cluttered environments.

### [Multi-Horizon Multi-Agent Planning Using Decentralised Monte Carlo Tree Search]()

We propose multi-horizon Monte Carlo tree search (MH-MCTS), the first framework for integrated hierarchical multi-horizon, multi-agent planning based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The method employs multiple simultaneous MCTS optimisations for each planning level within each agent, which are designed to optimise a joint objective function. Using concepts from decentralised Monte Carlo tree search (Dec-MCTS), the individual optimisations continuously exchange information about their current plans. This breaks the common top-down only information flow within the planning hierarchy and allows higher level optimisers to consider progress made by lower level planners. The method is implemented for survey missions using a fleet of ground robots. Simulation results with different mission profiles show substantial performance improvements of the new method of up to 59% compared to traditional MCTS and Dec-MCTS.

### [Generalized Mission Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Teams Via LLM-Constructed Hierarchical Trees]()

We present a novel mission-planning strategy for heterogeneous multi-robot teams, taking into account the specific constraints and capabilities of each robot. Our approach employs hierarchical trees to systematically break down complex missions into manageable sub-tasks. We develop specialized APIs and tools, which are utilized by Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently construct these hierarchical trees. Once the hierarchical tree is generated, it is further decomposed to create optimized schedules for each robot, ensuring adherence to their individual constraints and capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through detailed examples covering a wide range of missions, showcasing its flexibility and scalability.

### [Efficient Coordination and Synchronization of Multi-Robot Systems under Recurring Linear Temporal Logic]()

We consider multi-robot systems under recurring tasks formalized as linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. To solve the planning problem efficiently, we propose a bottom-up approach combining offline plan synthesis with online coordination, dynamically adjusting plans via real-time communication. To address action delays, we introduce a synchronization mechanism ensuring coordinated task execution, leading to a multi-agent coordination and synchronization framework that is adaptable to a wide range of multi-robot applications. The software package is developed in Python and ROS2 for broad deployment. We validate our findings through lab experiments involving nine robots showing enhanced adaptability compared to previous methods. Additionally, we conduct simulations with up to ninety agents to demonstrate the reduced computational complexity and the scalability features of our work.

### [HULK: Large-Scale Hierarchical Coordination under Continual and Uncertain Temporal Tasks]()

Multi-agent systems can be extremely efficient when working concurrently and collaboratively, e.g., for delivery, surveillance, search and rescue. Coordination of such teams often involves two aspects: (i) selecting appropriate subteams for different tasks in various areas; (ii) coordinating agents in the subteams to execute the associated subtasks. Existing work often assumes that the tasks are static and known beforehand, where an integer program can be formulated and solved offline.However, in many applications, the team-wise tasks are generated online continually by external requests; and the amount of subtasks within each task is uncertain (e.g., the number of packages to deliver, and victims to rescue). The aforementioned offline solution becomes inadequate as it would require constant re-computation for the whole team and global communication to broadcast the results. Thus, this work tackles the large-scale coordination problem under continual and uncertain temporal tasks, specified as temporal logic formulas over collaborative actions. The proposed hierarchical framework (HULK) consists of two interleaved layers: the rolling assignment of currently-known tasks to sub-teams within a certain horizon, and the dynamic coordination within a sub-team given the detected subtasks during online execution. Thus, the coordination is performed hierarchically at different granularities and triggering conditions, to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. It is validated rigorously over large-scale heterogeneous systems under various temporal tasks and environment uncertainties.

### [COHERENT: Collaboration of Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System with Large Language Models]()

Leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), recent LLM-based robot task planning methods yield promising results. However, they mainly focus on single or multiple homogeneous robots on simple tasks. Practically, complex long-horizon tasks always require collaboration among multiple heterogeneous robots especially with more complex action spaces, which makes these tasks more challenging. To this end, we propose COHERENT, a novel LLM-based task planning framework for collaboration of heterogeneous multi-robot systems including quadrotors, robotic dogs, and robotic arms. Specifically, a Proposal-Execution-Feedback-Adjustment (PEFA) mechanism is designed to decompose and assign actions for individual robots, where a centralized task assigner makes a task planning proposal to decompose the complex task into subtasks, and then assigns subtasks to robot executors. Each robot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and reports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The PEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging heterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex long-horizon tasks. The experimental results show that our work surpasses the previous methods by a large margin in terms of success rate and execution efficiency. The experimental videos, code, and benchmark are released at https://github.com/MrKeee/COHERENT.

### [LaMMA-P: Generalizable Multi-Agent Long-Horizon Task Allocation and Planning with LM-Driven PDDL Planner]()

Language models (LMs) possess a strong capability to comprehend natural language, making them effective in translating human instructions into detailed plans for simple robot tasks. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to handle long-horizon tasks, especially in subtask identification and allocation for cooperative heterogeneous robot teams. To address this issue, we propose a Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent PDDL Planner (LaMMA-P), a novel multi-agent task planning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks. LaMMA-P integrates the strengths of the LMs’ reasoning capability and the traditional heuristic search planner to achieve a high success rate and efficiency while demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Additionally, we create MAT-THOR, a comprehensive benchmark that features household tasks with two different levels of complexity based on the AI2-THOR environment. The experimental results demonstrate that LaMMA-P achieves a 105% higher success rate and 36% higher efficiency than existing LM-based multi-agent planners. The experimental videos, code, datasets, and detailed prompts used in each module can be found on the project website: https://lamma-p.github.io.

### [FlyKites: Human-Centric Interactive Exploration and Assistance under Limited Communication]()

Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects, temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks, especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication. It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration and intermittent communication (called the ``spread mode"), where the robots collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles (called the ``relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator adaptively.

### [Work Smarter Not Harder: Simple Imitation Learning with CS-PIBT Outperforms Large-Scale Imitation Learning for MAPF]()

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of effectively finding efficient collision-free paths for a group of agents in a shared workspace. The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large-scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large-scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does not produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF policy in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should always (1) use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g. CS-PIBT) and (2) include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT), as well as (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved.

### [Mastering Agile Jumping Skills from Simple Practices with Iterative Learning Control]()

Achieving precise target jumping with legged robots poses a significant challenge due to the long flight phase and the uncertainties inherent in contact dynamics and hardware. Forcefully attempting these agile motions on hardware could result in severe failures and potential damage. Motivated by this challenge, we propose an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) approach to learn and refine jumping skills from easy to difficult, instead of directly learning these challenging tasks. We verify that learning from simplicity can enhance safety and target jumping accuracy over trials. Compared to other ILC approaches for legged locomotion, our method can tackle the problem of a long flight phase where control input is not available. In addition, our approach allows the robot to apply what it learns from a simple jumping task to accomplish more challenging tasks within a few trials directly in hardware, instead of learning from scratch. We validate the method through extensive experiments on the A1 model and hardware for various tasks. Starting from a small jump (e.g., a forward jump 40cm), our learning approach empowers the robot to accomplish a variety of challenging targets, including jumping onto a 20cm high box, leaping to a greater distance of up to 60cm, as well as performing jumps while carrying an unknown payload of 2kg. Our framework allows the robot to reach the desired position and orientation targets with approximate errors of 1cm and 1 degree within a few trials.

### [Agile Continuous Jumping in Discontinuous Terrains]()

We focus on advancing the agility of quadrupedal robots with continuous, precise, and terrain-adaptive jumping in discontinuous terrains such as stairs and stepping stones. To accomplish this task, we design a hierarchical learning and control framework, which consists of a learned heightmap predictor for robust terrain perception, a reinforcement-learning-based centroidal-level motion policy for versatile and terrain-adaptive planning, and a low-level model-based leg controller for accurate motion tracking. In addition, we minimize the sim-to-real gap by accurately modeling the hardware characteristics. Such a hierarchical and hybrid framework effectively combines the advantages of model-free learning and model-based control, therefore enabling a Unitree Go1 robot to perform agile and continuous jumps on human-sized stairs and sparse stepping stones, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. In particular, the robot can cross two stair steps in each jump and completes a 3.5m long, 2.8m high, 14-step stair in 4.5 seconds. Moreover, the same policy outperforms baselines in various other parkour tasks, such as jumping over single horizontal or vertical discontinuities.

### [High Accuracy Aerial Maneuvers on Legged Robots Using Variational Integrator Discretized Trajectory Optimization]()

Performing acrobatic maneuvers involving long aerial phases, such as precise dives or multiple backflips from significant heights, remains an open challenge in legged robot autonomy. Such aggressive motions often require accurate state predictions over long horizons with multiple contacts and extended flight phases. Most existing trajectory optimization (TO) methods rely on Euler or Runge-Kutta integration, which can accumulate significant prediction errors over long planning horizons. In this work, we propose a novel whole-body TO method using variational integration (VI) and full-body nonlinear dynamics for long-flight aggressive maneuvers. Compared to traditional Euler-based TO, our approach using VI preserves energy and momentum properties of the continuous time system and reduces error between predicted and executed trajectories by factors of between 2 − 10 while achieving similar planning time. We successfully demonstrate long-flight triple backflips on a quadruped A1 robot model and backflips on a bipedal HECTOR robot model for various heights and distances, achieving landing angle errors of only a few degrees. In contrast, TO with Euler integration fails to achieve accurate landings in equivalent circumstances, e.g., with landing angle errors greater than 90◦ for triple backflips. We provide an open-source implementation of our VI-discretized TO to support further research on accurate dynamic maneuvers for multi-rigid-body robot systems with contact: https://github.com/DRCL-USC/VI_discretized_TO

### [Learn to Swim: Data-Driven LSTM Hydrodynamic Model for Quadruped Robot Gait Optimization]()

This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory network-based Fluid Experiment Data-Driven model (FED-LSTM) for predicting unsteady, nonlinear hydrodynamic forces on the underwater quadruped robot we constructed. Trained on experimental data from leg force and body drag tests conducted in both a recirculating water tank and a towing tank, FED-LSTM outperforms traditional empirical formulas (EF) commonly used for flow prediction over flat surfaces. The model demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability in capturing complex fluid dynamics, particularly in straight-line and turning-gait optimizations via the NSGA-II algorithm. FED-LSTM reduces deflection errors during straight-line swimming and improves turn times without increasing the turning radius. Hardware experiments further validate the model's precision and stability over EF. This approach provides a robust framework for enhancing the swimming performance of legged robots, laying the groundwork for future advances in underwater robotic locomotion.

### [Stage-Wise Reward Shaping for Acrobatic Robots: A Constrained Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Approach]()

As the complexity of tasks addressed through reinforcement learning (RL) increases, the definition of reward functions also has become highly complicated. We introduce an RL method aimed at simplifying the reward-shaping process through intuitive strategies. Initially, instead of a single reward function composed of various terms, we define multiple reward and cost functions within a constrained multi-objective RL (CMORL) framework. For tasks involving sequential complex movements, we segment the task into distinct stages and define multiple rewards and costs for each stage. Finally, we introduce a practical CMORL algorithm that maximizes objectives based on these rewards while satisfying constraints defined by the costs. The proposed method has been successfully demonstrated across a variety of acrobatic tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. Additionally, it has been shown to successfully perform tasks compared to existing RL and constrained RL algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/rllab-snu/Stage-Wise-CMORL.

### [Design and Implementation of a Swimming and Walking Quadruped for Seafloor Exploration]()

The seafloor is a complex environment and it is challenging to conduct detailed mapping, soil composition sampling, and habitat characterization missions in this benthic region. As a step toward overcoming these challenges, we present a quadruped robot capable of walking on the seafloor and maneuvering via midfluid swimming. SELQIE, the Seafloor Environment Legged Quadruped Intelligent Explorer, is capable of walking underwater at speeds up to 0.2 m/s, swimming at over 0.16 m/s, and transitioning between modes. We also introduce a path planning algorithm that can account for both swimming and walking gaits to efficiently navigate around or over obstacles, and demonstrate the robot executing such a multi-modal trajectory.

### [Beyond Robustness: Learning Unknown Dynamic Load Adaptation for Quadruped Locomotion on Rough Terrain]()

Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges in quadruped loco- motion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our method outperforms other methods in sudden load resistance, load stabilizing and locomotion with heavy load on rough terrain.

### [PIE: Parkour with Implicit-Explicit Learning Framework for Legged Robots]()

Parkour presents a highly challenging task for legged robots, requiring them to traverse various terrains with agile and smooth locomotion. This necessitates comprehensive understanding of both the robot's own state and the surrounding terrain, despite the inherent unreliability of robot perception and actuation. Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on complex pre-trained high-level terrain reconstruction modules or limit the maximum potential of robot parkour to avoid failure due to inaccurate perception. In this paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end learning-based parkour framework: Parkour with Implicit-Explicit learning framework for legged robots (PIE) that leverages dual-level implicit-explicit estimation. With this mechanism, even a low-cost quadruped robot equipped with an unreliable egocentric depth camera can achieve exceptional performance on challenging parkour terrains using a relatively simple training process and reward function. While the training process is conducted entirely in simulation, our real-world validation demonstrates successful zero-shot deployment of our framework, showcasing superior parkour performance on harsh terrains.

### [Determination of All Stable and Unstable Equilibria for Image-Point-Based Visual Servoing]()

Local minima are a well-known drawback of image-based visual servoing systems. Up to now, there were no formal guarantees on their number, or even their existence, according to the considered configuration. In this work, a formal approach is presented for the exhaustive computation of all minima and unstable equilibria for a class of six well-known image- based visual servoing controllers. This approach relies on a new polynomial formulation of the equilibrium condition that avoids using the camera pose. By using modern computational algebraic geometry methods and an ad hoc symmetry breaking strategy, the formal resolution of this new equilibrium condition is rendered computationally feasible. The proposed methodology is applied to compute the equilibria of several classical visual servoing tasks, with planar and non-planar configurations of four and five points. The effects of local minima and saddle points on the dynamics of the system are finally illustrated through intensive simulation results, as well as the effects of image noise and uncertainties on depths.

### [DiffTune: Auto-Tuning through Auto-Differentiation]()

The performance of robots in high-level tasks depends on the quality of their lower-level controller, which requires fine-tuning. However, the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics and controllers make tuning a challenging task when it is done by hand. We present DiffTune, a novel, gradient-based automatic tuning framework. We formulate the controller tuning as a parameter optimization problem and update the controller parameters through gradient-based optimization. The gradient is obtained using sensitivity propagation, which is the only method for gradient computation when tuning for a physical system instead of its simulated counterpart. Furthermore, we use L1 adaptive control to compensate for the uncertainties so that the gradient is not biased by the unmodelled uncertainties. We validate the DiffTune in simulation and compare it with state-of-the-art auto-tuning methods, where DiffTune achieves the best performance in a more efficient manner. Experiments on auto-tuning a nonlinear controller for quadrotor show promising results, where DiffTune achieves 3.5x tracking error reduction on an aggressive trajectory in only 10 trials over a 12-dimensional controller par

### [Output Feedback with Feedforward Robust Control for Motion Systems Driven by Nonlinear Position-Dependent Actuators (I)]()

This paper introduces a control approach for a motion system driven by a class of actuators with multiple nonlinearities. The proposed approach presents a combination of a feedforward controller and an output feedback controller to enhance the tracking performance of the motion system. The feedforward controller is mainly proposed to address the actuator dynamics and provide a linearization of the actuator without requiring measurements from the actuator. Subsequently, the output feedback controller is designed using the measured position to achieve a tracking objective for a desired reference signal, considering the unknown nonlinearities in the system and the error due to the open-loop compensation using feedforward control. The efficacy of the proposed control approach is validated through three applications: reluctance actuator, electrostatic microactuator, and magnetic levitation system. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in achieving the desired reference signal with minimal tracking error, considering that the actuator and system nonlinearities are unknown.

### [QP-Based Visual Servoing under Motion Blur-Free Constraint]()

This work proposes a QP-based visual servoing scheme for limiting motion blur during the achievement of a visual task. Unlike traditional image restoration approaches, we want to avoid any deconvolution step by keeping the image sequence acquired by the camera as sharp as possible. To do so, we select the norm of the image gradient as sharpness metric, from which we design a velocity constraint that is injected in a QP controller. Our system is evaluated for an Earth observation satellite. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.

### [FACET: Fast and Accurate Event-Based Eye Tracking Using Ellipse Modeling for Extended Reality]()

Eye tracking is a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR), but traditional frame-based systems struggle to meet XR's demands for high accuracy, low latency, and power efficiency. Event cameras offer a promising alternative due to their high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present FACET (Fast and Accurate Event-based Eye Tracking), an end-to-end neural network that directly outputs pupil ellipse parameters from event data, optimized for real-time XR applications. The ellipse output can be directly used in subsequent ellipse-based pupil trackers. We enhance the EV-Eye dataset by expanding annotated data and converting original mask labels to ellipse-based annotations to train the model. Besides, a novel trigonometric loss is adopted to address angle discontinuities and a fast causal event volume event representation method is put forward. On the enhanced EV-Eye test set, FACET achieves an average pupil center error of 0.20 pixels and an inference time of 0.53 ms, reducing pixel error and inference time by 1.6x and 1.8x compared to the prior art, EV-Eye, with 4.4x and 11.7x less parameters and arithmetic operations. The code is available at https://github.com/DeanJY/FACET.

### [EMoE-Tracker: Environmental MoE-Based Transformer for Robust Event-Guided Object Tracking]()

The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, no interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features for better interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Gating to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that fine-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to improve interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.

### [Learning Keypoints for Robotic Cloth Manipulation Using Synthetic Data]()

Assistive robots should be able to wash, fold or iron clothes. However, due to the variety, deformability and self-occlusions of clothes, creating robot systems for cloth manipulation is challenging. Synthetic data is a promising direction to improve generalization, but the sim-to-real gap limits its effectiveness. To advance the use of synthetic data for cloth manipulation tasks such as robotic folding, we present a synthetic data pipeline to train keypoint detectors for almost- flattened cloth items. To evaluate its performance, we have also collected a real-world dataset. We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64% and an average keypoint distance of 18 pixels. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance to 74% mAP and an average distance of only 9 pixels. Furthermore, we describe failure modes of the keypoint detectors and compare different approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials. We also quantify the remaining sim- to-real gap and argue that further improvements to the fidelity of cloth assets will be required to further reduce this gap. The code, dataset and trained models are available online.

### [RaggeDi: Diffusion-Based State Estimation of Disordered Rags, Sheets, Towels and Blankets]()

Cloth state estimation is an important problem in robotics. It is essential for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings. However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the performance of our method. Results indicate that our method outperforms two recent methods in both accuracy and speed.

### [Excavating in the Wild: The GOOSE-Ex Dataset for Semantic Segmentation]()

The successful deployment of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems is highly dependent on the data availability for the respective system in its deployment environment. Especially for unstructured outdoor environments, very few datasets exist for even fewer robotic platforms and scenarios. In an earlier work, we presented the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE) framework along with 10000 multimodal frames from an offroad vehicle to enhance the perception capabilities in unstructured environments. In this work, we address the generalizability of the GOOSE framework. To accomplish this, we open-source the GOOSE-Ex dataset, which contains additional 5000 labeled multimodal frames from various completely different environments, recorded on a robotic excavator and a quadruped platform. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the semantic segmentation performance on different platforms and sensor modalities in unseen environments. In addition, we demonstrate how the combined datasets can be utilized for different downstream applications or competitions such as offroad navigation, object manipulation or scene completion. The dataset, its platform documentation and pre-trained state-of-the-art models for offroad perception will be made available on https://goose-dataset.de/.

### [Robotic Framework for Iterative and Adaptive Profile Grading of Sand]()

This paper studies sand profile grading, a manipulation task to obtain a desired geometric curve in sand. Manipulating sand is challenging because like other amorphous materials, its properties are difficult to estimate and emergent effects such as collapses may occur which both influence the manipulation outcome. To tackle these challenges, humans iterate and adapt their manual actions to the observed material states. In this paper, we propose to replicate this adaptive and iterative approach on a robotic profile grading task. Our results demonstrate that (1) tool insertion adaptation reduces force limit violations during tool-material interactions, (2) grading angle adaptation ensures no undercutting or collisions while allowing for cutting or smoothing the sand profile, and (3) adapting progress speed to task evolution provides a balance between grading precision and execution time. This paper’s findings pave the way for generalized and transferable robotic systems manipulating various amorphous materials and automating a larger set of construction tasks and beyond.

### [Autonomous Excavation of Challenging Terrain Using Oscillatory Primitives and Adaptive Impedance Control]()

This paper addresses the challenge of autonomous excavation of challenging terrains, in particular those that are prone to jamming and inter-particle adhesion when tackled by a standard penetrate-drag-scoop motion pattern. Inspired by human excavation strategies, our approach incorporates oscillatory rotation elements -- including swivel, twist, and dive motions -- to break up compacted, tangled grains and reduce jamming. We also present an adaptive impedance control method, the Reactive Attractor Impedance Controller (RAIC), that adapts a motion trajectory to unexpected forces during loading in a manner that tracks a trajectory closely when loads are low, but avoids excessive loads when significant resistance is met. Our method is evaluated on four terrains using a robotic arm, demonstrating improved excavation performance across multiple metrics, including volume scooped, protective stop rate, and trajectory completion percentage.

### [Diffusion-Based Self-Supervised Imitation Learning from Imperfect Visual Servoing Demonstrations for Robotic Glass Installation]()

Heavy-duty glass installation is a high-risk, precision-critical task in modern construction, traditionally performed through labor-intensive and error-prone manual methods. This paper presents a novel robotic framework that leverages diffusion-based self-supervised imitation learning from imperfect visual servoing demonstrations to achieve safe and precise glass installation. Specifically, our approach employs noisy and suboptimal demonstration data obtained via visual servoing to train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This model iteratively refines installation trajectories, transforming them into smooth, precise, and collision-free movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses conventional visual servoing and standard imitation learning baselines in terms of success rate, precision, and installation efficiency, while markedly improving operational safety. Our results establish a new benchmark for automating complex, high-risk tasks in construction robotics.

### [A Global-Local Graph Attention Network for Deformable Linear Objects Dynamic Interaction with Environment]()

Accurately modeling the interactions between deformable linear objects (DLOs) and their environments is crucial for active deformation control by robot manipulators. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown immense potential in particle-based simulation of DLOs. However, most existing studies propagate particle information in sequence, ignoring that particle motions, including the distal particle, correlate strongly with each other and the interaction state. In this paper, a global and local attention dynamic simulation model named GladSim is designed based on GNNs and the attention mechanism to aggregate information among particles and focus on the interaction particles for DLO interaction with the environment. Specifically, a global virtual node is proposed to deliver particle information and shorten the propagation path for the first time, which connects all the particles and aggregates global information. When the DLOs and the obstacle boundary particles are close, an edge is established between them to capture the interaction state. Moreover, we group all the particles by k-hop neighbors and design a HopSA module that combines hop attention and self-attention to discover the correlates among adjacent particles. Experimental results on simulation and real-world data show that the proposed GladSim network's predictive accuracy significantly outperforms baseline models, especially in long-term prediction.

### [Generating Causal Explanations of Vehicular Agent Behavioural Interactions with Learnt Reward Profiles]()

Transparency and explainability are important features that responsible autonomous vehicles should possess, particularly when interacting with humans, and causal reasoning offers a strong basis to provide these qualities. However, even if one assumes agents act to maximise some concept of reward, it is difficult to make accurate causal inferences of agent planning without capturing what is of importance to the agent. Thus our work aims to learn a weighting of reward metrics for agents such that explanations for agent interactions can be causally inferred. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively across three real-world driving datasets, demonstrating a functional improvement over previous methods and competitive performance across evaluation metrics.

### [Fast Online Learning of CLiFF-Maps in Changing Environments]()

Maps of dynamics are effective representations of motion patterns learned from prior observations, with recent research demonstrating their ability to enhance various downstream tasks such as human-aware robot navigation, long-term human motion prediction, and robot localization. Current advancements have primarily concentrated on methods for learning maps of human flow in environments where the flow is static, i.e., not assumed to change over time. In this paper we propose an online update method of the CLiFF-map (an advanced map of dynamics type that models motion patterns as velocity and orientation mixtures) to actively detect and adapt to human flow changes. As new observations are collected, our goal is to update a CLiFF-map to effectively and accurately integrate them, while retaining relevant historic motion patterns. The proposed online update method maintains a probabilistic representation in each observed location, updating parameters by continuously tracking sufficient statistics. In experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method is able to maintain accurate representations of human motion dynamics, contributing to high performance flow-compliant planning downstream tasks, while being orders of magnitude faster than the comparable baselines.

### [A Hybrid Approach to Indoor Social Navigation: Integrating Reactive Local Planning and Proactive Global Planning]()

We consider the problem of indoor building-scale social navigation, where the robot must reach a point goal as quickly as possible without colliding with humans who are freely moving around. Factors such as varying crowd densities, unpredictable human behavior, and the constraints of indoor spaces add significant complexity to the navigation task, necessitating a more advanced approach. We propose a modular navigation framework that leverages the strengths of both classical methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach employs a global planner to generate waypoints, assigning soft costs around anticipated pedestrian locations, encouraging caution around potential future positions of humans. Simultaneously, the local planner, powered by DRL, follows these waypoints while avoiding collisions. The combination of these planners enables the agent to perform complex maneuvers and effectively navigate crowded and constrained environments while improving reliability. Many existing studies on social navigation are conducted in simplistic or open environments, limiting the ability of trained models to perform well in complex, real-world settings. To advance research in this area, we introduce a new 2D benchmark designed to facilitate development and testing of social navigation strategies in indoor environments. We benchmark our method against traditional and RL-based navigation strategies, demonstrating that our approach outperforms both.

### [Overlapping Social Navigation Principles: A Framework for Social Robot Navigation]()

As autonomous robots become integrated into society, they must socially navigate around humans. We propose that effective social robot navigation relies on three key principles: social norms, perceived safety, and legibility. Our framework, Overlapping Social Navigation Principles, suggests that the strength of each principle is influenced by the presence of other principles. To test our framework, we implemented SRN behaviors on an autonomous robot in a passing scenario and conducted an online study where participants ranked videos of different SRN behavior combinations. Our findings show that incorporating all three principles enhances SRN, with social norms having the greatest impact.

### [Relative Velocity-Based Reward Model for Socially-Aware Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning]()

Mobile robots are increasingly deployed in shared environments where they must learn to navigate alongside humans. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques have shown promise in developing navigation policies that account for interactions within crowds, fostering socially acceptable movement. However, these techniques often depend heavily on collision avoidance rewards to ensure safe navigation. In this study, we introduce a novel reward component based on relative velocity for collision avoidance, which integrates both the robot’s and humans’ kinematics within personal distance constraints. We conducted a thorough evaluation comparing this new reward model against a conventional one in simulated environments using advanced DRL methods. Our findings indicate that the proposed reward model improves the robots’ ability to avoid collisions and navigate towards their goals while being socially acceptable.

### [SICNav: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation Using Model Predictive Control and Bilevel Optimization]()

Robots need to predict and react to human motions to navigate through a crowd without collisions. Many existing methods decouple prediction from planning, which does not account for the interaction between robot and human motions and can lead to the robot getting stuck. We propose SICNav, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that jointly solves for robot motion and predicted crowd motion in closed-loop. We model each human in the crowd to be following an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) scheme and embed that model as a constraint in the robot’s local planner, resulting in a bilevel nonlinear MPC optimization problem. We use a KKT- reformulation to cast the bilevel problem as a single level and use a nonlinear solver to optimize. Our MPC method can influence pedestrian motion while explicitly satisfying safety constraints in a single-robot multi-human environment. We analyze the performance of SICNav in two simulation environments and indoor experiments with a real robot to demonstrate safe robot motion that can influence the surrounding humans. We also validate the trajectory forecasting performance of ORCA on a human trajectory dataset.

### [Autonomous Continuous Capsulorhexis Based on a Force-Vision-Guided Robot System]()

Capsulorhexis is challenging in cataract surgery, since the size, centering, and circularity of the capsule are important. Those indicators are closely related to the subsequent step of phacoemulsification and the postoperative position of the intraocular lens. It takes 3-5 years for a resident to practice, while the occurrence of deficient capsulorhexis is still inevitable. This paper proposes a robotic system to automate Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis(CCC) in cataract surgery. A typical ophthalmic microscope system and a triaxial force sensor are utilized to guide the robot system with a force-vision method. The constraint of a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) is designed to perform the surgery route. The experimental results on ex-vivo porcine eyes show our autonomous method can achieve a satisfactory 6mm capsule. With an average centering deviation below 76% and circularity of 0.993, the consistency of the capsulorhexis is comparable to a surgeon-made one.

### [Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Blood Drawing and in Vivo Studies on Submillimetre Vessels of Rats]()

Billions of vascular access procedures are performed annually worldwide, serving as a crucial first step in various clinical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For pediatric or elderly individuals, whose vessels are small in size (typically 2 to 3 mm in diameter for adults and <1 mm in children), vascular access can be highly challenging. This study presents an image-guided robotic system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of difficult vascular access procedures. The system integrates a 6-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm with a 3-DoF end-effector, ensuring precise navigation and needle insertion. Multi-modal imaging and sensing technologies have been utilized to endow the medical robot with precision and safety, while ultrasound (US) imaging guidance is specifically evaluated in this study. To evaluate in vivo vascular access in submillimeter vessels, we conducted ultrasound-guided robotic blood drawing on the tail veins (with a diameter of 0.7 ± 0.2 mm) of 40 rats. The results demonstrate that the system achieved a first-attempt success rate of 95%. The high first-attempt success rate in intravenous vascular access, even with small blood vessels, demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in performing these procedures. This capability reduces the risk of failed attempts, minimizes patient discomfort, and enhances clinical efficiency.

### [Sensory Glove-Based Surgical Robot User Interface]()

Robotic surgery has reached a high level of maturity and has become an integral part of standard surgical care. However, existing surgeon consoles are bulky and take up valuable space in the operating room, present challenges for surgical team coordination, and their proprietary nature makes it difficult to take advantage of recent technological advances, especially in virtual and augmented reality. One potential area for further improvement is the integration of modern sensory gloves into robotic platforms, allowing surgeons to control robotic arms intuitively with their hand movements. We propose one such system that combines an HTC Vive tracker, a Manus Meta Prime 3 XR sensory glove, and SCOPEYE wireless smart glasses. The system controls one arm of a da Vinci surgical robot. In addition to moving the arm, the surgeon can use fingers to control the end-effector of the surgical instrument. Hand gestures are used to implement clutching and similar functions. In particular, we introduce clutching of the instrument orientation, a functionality unavailable in the da Vinci system. The vibrotactile elements of the glove are used to provide feedback to the user when gesture commands are invoked. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation has been conducted comparing the current device to the dVRK console; the system shows that it has excellent tracking accuracy and allows surgeons to efficiently perform common surgical training tasks with minimal practice with the new interface.

### [Self-Deformable Magnetic Miniature Robot for Traction Assistance in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection]()

Between 1999 and 2020, gastrointestinal cancers were responsible for over three million deaths, emphasizing the critical role of minimally invasive surgical techniques like Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) in managing such life-threatening conditions. ESD, which dissects the connective tissue between the mucosal and muscular layers using an electrosurgical knife connected to an endoscope, requires a constant traction force to stabilize tissues and expose underlying anatomical structures. This paper introduces a miniature magnetic flexible robot, actuated by a permanent magnet on a robotic manipulator, designed to enhance ESD by providing traction forces consistently on lesions. The robot was fabricated by casting magnetic silicone composites, and its safe deployment through the endoscope instrument channel was successfully demonstrated, avoiding tissue contact. Experiments in a rubber intestine model validated the feasibility of providing constant traction and 2 DOF orientation control via the robot, allowing real-time fine-tuning of the force direction. This reduces the difficulty and improves the precision and safety of ESD. This research presents a practical method for achieving stable force output in medical miniature robots, particularly in gastrointestinal procedures.

### [Variable-Stiffness Nasotracheal Intubation Robot with Passive Buffering: A Modular Platform in Mannequin Studies]()

Intubation is a critical medical procedure for securing airway patency in patients, but the inconsistent skill levels among medical practitioners necessitate the advancement of better robotic solutions. While orotracheal intubation robots have been widely developed, nasotracheal intubation remains essential in specific clinical scenarios. However, nasotracheal intubation robots are still underdeveloped and lack buffer protection mechanisms to ensure safety. This study presents a novel variable-stiffness nasotracheal intubation robot (NIR) with passive buffering. The proposed NIR is a modular platform capable of performing the main steps of nasotracheal intubation, validated through mannequin studies via teleoperation. We proposed a variable-stiffness fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) control module for the FOB distal end control, and validated its dual functionality in experiments: low-stiffness mode provides passive buffering during nasal cavity navigation, with a frontal peak force of 2.8 N and a lateral peak force of 0.12 N; high-stiffness mode enhances load-bearing capacity for near-glottis navigation, with a frontal bearing force of 4.9 N and a lateral bearing force of 0.42 N. Additionally, a compact (74 × 64 × 53 mm, 150 g) FOB feeding module with passive failure protection was designed to limit the max frontal impact force to 2.3 N.

### [SurgPose: A Dataset for Articulated Robotic Surgical Tool Pose Estimation and Tracking]()

Accurate and efficient surgical robotic tool pose estimation is of fundamental significance to downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) in surgical training and learning-based autonomous manipulation. While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120K surgical instrument instances of 6 categories as shown in Fig. 1. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we tested a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose. More details can be found at surgpose.github.io.

### [On High Performance Control of Concentric Tube Continuum Robots through Parsimonious Calibration]()

Continuum robots deform continuously, compared to conventional robots composed of rigid links and joints, and require dedicated calibration methods. Indeed, calibration is an essential step to obtain high performance control, as it directly influences robot accuracy. In this paper, we investigate how model parameters influence both model accuracy and model-based closed-loop control accuracy of Concentric Tube Continuum Robots (CTCR). A fast, robust, and real-time implementation of the Cosserat rod model is first introduced. Then, a model-based Jacobian control scheme is presented. A parsimonious calibration procedure focused on control accuracy is finally proposed to achieve submillimetric tracking errors along a 3D trajectory at velocity reaching 5 mm/s in complex scenarios including actuation constraints, obstacle avoidance, and external forces. Results are demonstrated both in simulation and on an experimental setup of a 3-tube CTCR.

### [Deformation Control of a 3D Soft Object Using RGB-D Visual Servoing and FEM-Based Dynamic Model]()

In this letter, we present a visual control framework for accurately positioning feature points belonging to the surface of a 3D deformable object to desired 3D positions, by acting on a set of manipulated points using a robotic manipulator. Notably, our framework considers the dynamic behavior of the object deformation, that is, we do not assume that the object is in its static equilibrium during the manipulation. By relying on a coarse dynamic Finite Element Model (FEM), we have successfully formulated the analytical relationship expressing the motion of the feature points to the six degrees of freedom (6~DOF) motion of a robot gripper. From this modeling step, a novel closed-loop deformation controller is designed. To be robust against model approximations, the whole shape of the object is tracked in real-time using an RGB-D camera, thus allowing to correct any drift between the object and its model on-the-fly. Our model-based and vision-based controller has been validated in real experiments. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

### [Real-Time Deformation-Aware Control for Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injection Based on OCT Guidance]()

Robotic platforms provide consistent and precise tool positioning that significantly enhances retinal microsurgery. Integrating such systems with intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) enables image-guided robotic interventions, allowing autonomous performance of advanced treatments, such as injecting therapeutic agents into the subretinal space. However, tissue deformations due to tool-tissue interactions constitute a significant challenge in autonomous iOCT-guided robotic subretinal injections. Such interactions impact correct needle positioning and procedure outcomes. This paper presents a novel method for autonomous subretinal injection under iOCT guidance that considers tissue deformations during the insertion procedure. The technique is achieved through real-time segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from densely sampled iOCT B-scans, which we refer to as B 5 -scans. Using B 5 -scans we monitor the position of the instrument relative to a virtual target layer between the ILM and RPE. Our experiments on ex-vivo porcine eyes demonstrate dynamic adjustment of the insertion depth and overall improved accuracy in needle positioning compared to prior autonomous insertion approaches. Compared to a 35% success rate in subretinal bleb generation with previous approaches, our method reliably created subretinal blebs in 90% our experiments. The source code and data used in this study are publicly available on GitHub 1 .

### [6-DoF Shape Servoing of Deformable Objects in Co-Rotated Space of Modal Graph]()

Shape control of deformable objects under both rotational and translational deformations is important for versatile robotic applications. However, deformation control with full 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulation is an open problem, since modeling and describing rotational deformations lead to significant challenges. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a novel method by introducing a co-rotated space for the modal graph representation of objects with unknown physical and geometric models. In this space, we design new deformation features that can encode local rotations while preserving a compact and low-frequency shape representation. Moreover, these features can be mapped analytically to the robot manipulation, enabling the design of adaptive control laws with guaranteed stability for unmodeled objects. Experiments on complex volumetric objects demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method with raw, noisy, and unregistered point clouds. The results highlight the importance of integrating the co-rotated features to address rotational deformations.

### [Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes]()

Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments on public datasets captured with static endoscopes demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.

### [One-Shot Video Imitation Via Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs]()

Learning to manipulate dynamic and deformable objects from a single demonstration video holds great promise in terms of scalability. Previous approaches have predominantly focused on either replaying object relationships or actor trajectories. The former often struggles to generalize across diverse tasks, while the latter suffers from data inefficiency. Moreover, both methodologies encounter challenges in capturing invisible physical attributes, such as forces. In this paper, we propose to interpret video demonstrations through a series of Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs (PSAGs), where nodes represent objects and edges denote relationships between objects. We further ground geometric constraints through simulation to estimate non-geometric, visually imperceptible attributes. The augmented PSAGs are then applied in real robot experiments. Our approach has been validated across a range of tasks, such as Cutting Avocado, Cutting Vegetable, Pouring Liquid, Rolling Dough, and Slicing Pizza. We demonstrate successful generalization to novel objects with distinct visual and physical properties. For visualizations of the learned policies please check: https://jianrenw.com/PSAG/

### [KUDA: Keypoints to Unify Dynamics Learning and Visual Prompting for Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation]()

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), significant progress has been made in developing open-vocabulary robotic manipulation systems. However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a textit{keypoint-based target specification} is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. The project page is available at url{http://kuda-dynamics.github.io/}.

### [DLO Perceiver: Grounding Large Language Model for Deformable Linear Objects Perception]()

The perception of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is a challenging task due to their complex and ambiguous appearance, lack of discernible features, typically small sizes, and deformability. Despite these challenges, achieving a robust and effective segmentation of DLOs is crucial to introduce robots into environments where they are currently underrepresented, such as domestic and complex industrial settings. In this context, the integration of language-based inputs can simplify the perception task while also enabling the possibility of introducing robots as human companions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture for the perception of DLOs, wherein the input image is augmented with a text-based prompt guiding the segmentation of the target DLO. After encoding the image and text separately, a Perceiver-inspired structure is exploited to compress the concatenated data into transformer layers and generate the output mask from a latent vector representation. The method is experimentally evaluated on real-world images of DLOs like electrical cables and ropes, validating its efficacy and efficiency in real practical scenarios.

### [Label Anything: An Interpretable, High-Fidelity and Prompt-Free Annotator]()

Learning-based street scene semantic understanding in autonomous driving (AD) has advanced significantly recently, but the performance of the AD model is heavily dependent on the quantity and quality of the annotated training data. However, traditional manual labeling involves high cost to annotate the vast amount of required data for training robust model. To mitigate this cost of manual labeling, we propose a Label Anything Model (denoted as LAM), serving as an interpretable, high-fidelity, and prompt-free data annotator. Specifically, we firstly incorporate a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the latent features. On top of ViT, we propose a semantic class adapter (SCA) and an optimization-oriented unrolling algorithm (OptOU), both with a quite small number of trainable parameters. SCA is proposed to fuse ViT-extracted features to consolidate the basis of the subsequent automatic annotation. OptOU consists of multiple cascading layers and each layer contains an optimization formulation to align its output with the ground truth as closely as possible, though which OptOU acts as being interpretable rather than learning-based blackbox nature. In addition, training SCA and OptOU requires only a single pre-annotated RGB seed image, owing to their small volume of learnable parameters. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed LAM can generate high-fidelity annotations (almost 100% in mIoU) for multiple real-world datasets (i.e., Camvid, Cityscapes, and Apolloscapes) and CARLA simulation dataset.

### [Logic-RAG: Augmenting Large Multimodal Models with Visual-Spatial Knowledge for Road Scene Understanding]()

Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous driving systems for user interaction. However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 50% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Imran2205/LogicRAG.

### [Discrete Contrastive Learning for Diffusion Policies in Autonomous Driving]()

Learning to perform accurate and rich simulations of human driving behaviors from data for autonomous vehicle testing remains challenging due to human driving styles' high diversity and variance. We address this challenge by proposing a novel approach that leverages contrastive learning to extract a dictionary of driving styles from pre-existing human driving data. We discretize these styles with quantization, and the styles are used to learn a conditional diffusion policy for simulating human drivers. Our empirical evaluation confirms that the behaviors generated by our approach are both safer and more human-like than those of the machine-learning-based baseline methods. We believe this has the potential to enable higher realism and more effective techniques for evaluating and improving the performance of autonomous vehicles.

### [Intelligence Evaluation Methods for Autonomous Vehicles]()

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced the intelligence of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, owing to the complexity of AV behavior and the high dimensionality of driving environments, the objective and practical quantitative evaluation of AV intelligence remains a significant and unresolved challenge. This paper proposes a robust training-based comprehensive evaluation (RTCE) system specifically designed to assess the intelligence of AVs in the time dimension. Beginning with a foundation model, the first generation of AVs is developed by training in the initial naturalistic traffic scenarios. To effectively test the intelligence of the AVs, we propose an adversarial trajectory optimization technique to generate challenging, critical test scenarios that evaluate the learning capabilities of AVs in complex environments. Through robust training in these complex scenarios, the second generation of AVs is obtained. To objectively and effectively quantify the intelligence of AVs, we further propose a comprehensive evaluation metric system encompassing five dimensions and 14 evaluation metrics. The intelligence score of each AV is computed using the objective multi-criteria decision-making approach. The proposed intelligence evaluation method is validated using various self-evolution autonomous driving algorithms. The results demonstrate that the RTCE method can quantitatively and effectively test the intelligence of AVs in a multi-dimensional and automated manner. Furthermore, the proposed method is flexible and generalizable, making it adaptable to different testing platforms and autonomous driving algorithms.

### [NaVid-4D: Unleashing Spatial Intelligence in Egocentric RGB-D Videos for Vision-And-Language Navigation]()

Understanding and reasoning about the 4D space-time is crucial for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, previous works lack in-depth exploration in this aspect, resulting in bottlenecked spatial perception and action precision of VLN agents. In this work, we introduce NaVid-4D, a Vision Language Model (VLM) based navigation agent taking the lead in explicitly showcasing the capabilities of spatial intelligence in the real world. Given natural language instructions, NaVid-4D requires only egocentric RGB-D video streams as observations to perform spatial understanding and reasoning for generating precise instruction-following robotic actions. NaVid-4D learns navigation policies using the data from simulation environments and is endowed with precise spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using web data. Without the need to pre-train an RGB-D foundation model, we propose a method capable of directly injecting the depth features into the visual encoder of a VLM. We further compare the use of factually captured depth information with the monocularly estimated one and find NaVid-4D works well with both while using estimated depth offers greater generalization capability and better mitigates the sim-to-real gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaVid-4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulation environment and makes impressive VLN performance with spatial intelligence happen in the real world.

### [Generating Out-Of-Distribution Scenarios Using Language Models]()

The deployment of autonomous vehicles controlled by machine learning techniques requires extensive testing in diverse real-world environments, robust handling of edge cases and out-of-distribution scenarios, and comprehensive safety validation to ensure that these systems can navigate safely and effectively under unpredictable conditions. Addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) driving scenarios is essential for enhancing safety, as OOD scenarios help validate the reliability of the models within the vehicle’s autonomy stack. However, generating OOD scenarios is challenging due to their long-tailed distribution and rarity in urban driving datasets. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in autonomous driving, particularly for their zero-shot generalization and common-sense reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we leverage these LLM strengths to introduce a framework for generating diverse OOD driving scenarios. Our approach uses LLMs to construct a branching tree, where each branch represents a unique OOD scenario. These scenarios are then simulated in the CARLA simulator using an automated framework that aligns scene augmentation with the corresponding textual descriptions. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations, and assess its performance via a diversity metric that measures the richness of the scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new "OOD-ness" metric, which quantifies how much the generated scenarios deviate from typical urban driving conditions. Furthermore, we explore the capacity of modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and safely navigate through the simulated OOD scenarios. Our findings offer valuable insights into the reliability of language models in addressing OOD scenarios within the context of urban driving.

### [MAGIC-VFM - Meta-Learning Adaptation for Ground Interaction Control with Visual Foundation Models]()

Control of off-road vehicles is challenging due to the complex dynamic interactions with the terrain. Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that

### [DINO-MOT: 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Visual Foundation Model for Pedestrian Re-Identification Using Visual Memory Mechanism]()

In the advancing domain of autonomous driving, this research focuses on enhancing 3D Multi-Object Tracking (3D-MOT). Pedestrians are particularly vulnerable in urban environments, and robust tracking methodologies are required to understand their movements. Prevalent Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) frameworks often underutilize the rich visual data from sensors such as cameras. This study leverages the advanced visual foundation model, DINOv2, to refine the TBD framework by incorporating camera modality, thereby improving pedestrian tracking consistency and overall 3D-MOT performance. The proposed DINO-MOT framework is the first application of DINOv2 for enhancing 3D-MOT through pedestrian Re-Identification (Re-ID), and Score Filter Ceiling is implemented to prevent premature exclusion of low-confidence 3D detections during tracking association. Furthermore, utilization of DINOv2 as a feature extractor within the DINO-MOT framework reduces pedestrian ID switches by up to 12.3%. Achieving AMOTA of 76.3% on the nuScenes test dataset, DINO-MOT has set a new benchmark in the 3D MOT literature with an improvement of 0.5%, securing the top rank on the leaderboard. Furthermore, this research paves the potential of applying a visual foundation model to improve the existing TBD framework, to enhance 3D-MOT in autonomous driving.

### [Hysteresis Compensation of Tendon-Sheath Mechanism Using Nonlinear Programming Based on Preisach Model]()

Tendon sheath mechanism (TSM) is an essential mechanical element for the implementation of flexible endoscopic systems owing to its small volume and simple structure. However, nonlinear characteristics, such as backlash, hysteresis and friction occur when employing such a component. In this study, we formulate a Preisach hysteresis model consisting of elementary hysteresis operators. Subsequently, we propose a compensation algorithm that repeatedly and sequentially solves a nonlinear optimization problem online, producing an inverse control signal for the desired output at every time step, compensating the nonlinear effects of TSM. The results indicate that the presented model and control scheme are promising for motion control in any application utilizing TSM.

### [Resolution Optimal Motion Planning for Medical Needle Steering from Airway Walls in the Lung]()

Steerable needles are novel medical devices capable of following curved paths through tissue, enabling them to avoid anatomical obstacles and steer to hard-to-reach sites in tissue, including targets in the lung for lung cancer diagnosis. Steerable needles are typically deployed into tissue from an insertion surface, and selecting the insertion site is critical for procedure success as it determines which paths the needle can take to its target. Prior motion planners for steerable needles typically only plan from a specific start pose to the target. We introduce a new resolution-optimal steerable needle motion planner that efficiently finds plans from an insertion surface to a target position, handling additional degrees of freedom at both the start and the target. Our algorithm systematically builds a search tree consisting of needle motion primitives backward from the target towards the insertion surface, which allows it to provide an optimality guarantee up to the resolution of the primitives. The algorithm finds higher-quality plans faster than prior state-of-the-art motion planners, as demonstrated in anatomical scenario simulations in the lung.

### [Self-Sufficient 5-DoF Discrete Global Localization for Magnetically-Actuated Endoscope in Bronchoscopy]()

Existing sensor-based global localization methods limit the miniaturization potential of magnetically-actuated endoscopes (MAE) while localization based on external medical imaging demands accurate registration and imposes a variety of modality-specific challenges during continuous image acquisition. This work proposes a novel self-sufficient method for discrete (one-time) global localization of an MAE based solely on inherent endoscopic images without any prior MAE pose information. More specifically, it adopts a model-free control approach to determine five different external magnet (EM) poses (corresponding to five independent nonlinear equations) that can align the MAE image center with the lumen center while the MAE maintains the same pose. The five degree-of freedom (DoF) global pose of the MAE can then be estimated by minimizing the root mean square of MAE's torque balance residuals under these EM poses. Our proposed method achieves similar accuracy as other sensor-based methods for permanent magnet-driven MAE with 6.7 ± 2.1 mm position error and 9.5 ± 2.9° orientation error in the experiments. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not require physical sensor integration, enabling a more compact endoscope design for exploration in narrower respiratory tracts. It also offers a critical step toward achieving sensorless and continuous global localization of the permanent magnet-driven MAE during its autonomous navigation.

### [Semi-Autonomous 2.5D Control of Untethered Magnetic Suture Needle]()

Untethered miniature surgical tools could significantly reduce invasiveness and enhance patient outcomes in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical procedures. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of performing semi-autonomous suturing tasks using an untethered magnetic needle controlled by an external electromagnetic manipulator. The electromagnetic manipulator can generate magnetic torques and gradient-based pulling forces to actuate the magnetic needle. Here, we develop and implement a semi-autonomous 2.5D control method for controlling the in-plane position and both in-plane and out-of-plane orientations of a magnetic needle for suturing on tissue-mimicking agar gel phantoms. The method includes recognizing needles and incisions, planning trajectory, and performing suturing with visual feedback control. We conduct two mock suturing tasks using both continuous and interrupted techniques on 1% agar gel phantoms with 2 cm and 3 cm incision sizes. The results demonstrate precise needle control, with an average root-mean-square position error of 1.01 mm and 1.12 mm across tasks. The system also achieved submillimeter-level suture spacing accuracy, comparable to surgeons using state-of-the-art surgical robots. These findings highlight the feasibility of using untethered magnetic suture needles for minimally invasive suturing procedures.

### [Steerable Tape-Spring Needle for Autonomous Sharp Turns through Tissue]()

Steerable needles offer a minimally invasive method to deliver treatment to hard-to-reach tissue regions. We introduce a new class of textit{tape-spring} steerable needles, capable of sharp turns ranging from 15 to 150 degrees with a turn radius of as low as 3mm, which minimize surrounding tissue damage. In this work, we derive and experimentally validate a geometric model for our steerable needle design. We evaluate both manual and robotic steering of the needle along a Dubins path in 7 kPa and 13 kPa tissue phantoms, simulating our target clinical application in healthy and unhealthy liver tissue. We conduct experiments to measure needle robustness to stiffness transitions between non-homogeneous tissues. We demonstrate progress towards clinical use with needle tip tracking via ultrasound imaging, navigation around anatomical obstacles, and integration with a robotic autonomous steering system.

### [Shape Control of Concentric Tube Robots Via Approximate Follow-The-Leader Motion]()

Concentric tube robots (CTRs) are miniaturized continuum robots that are promising for robotic minimally invasive surgeries. Control methods to date have primarily focused on controlling the robot tip. However, small changes in the tip position can result in large deviations in the shape of the robot body, motivating the need for shape control to ensure safe navigation in constrained environments. One proposed method for shape control, known as follow-the-leader (FTL) motion, allows the robot to deploy while occupying minimal volume but is limited to specific CTR designs and deployment sequences. In this paper, we propose a shape control method that approximates FTL motion and is applicable to arbitrary tip navigation tasks without requiring a predefined trajectory or specific tube design. This shape control method is framed as a nonlinear optimization problem, and through linearization of the CTR's kinematics, we turn it into a quadratic program solved by a shape controller that requires minimal knowledge of the robot's shape. Simulation results show that our proposed shape control method enables better approximate FTL motion compared to a state-of-the-art Jacobian-based tip controller across different tube sets and tip paths while remaining computationally comparable. Furthermore, a hardware demonstration validates the effectiveness of the shape controller on a physical system during teleoperation.

### [Model-Based Parameter Selection for a Steerable Continuum Robot — Applications to Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)]()

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a minimally invasive procedure for diagnosing lung infections and diseases. However, navigating tortuous lung anatomy to the distal branches of the bronchoalveolar tree for adequate sampling using BAL remains challenging. Continuum robots have been used to improve the navigation of guidewires, catheters, and endoscopes and could be applied to the BAL procedure as well. One class of continuum robots is constructed from a notched tube and actuated using a tendon. Many tendon-driven notched continuum robots use uniform machining parameters to achieve approximately constant-curvature configurations, which may be unsuitable for traversing the tortuous anatomy of the lungs. This letter presents a model that predicts the curvature of a robot with arbitrary notch shapes subjected to tendon tension. The model predicted the deflection of rectangular, elliptical, and sinusoidal notches in a 0.89 mm diameter nitinol tube with 2.32%, 3.65%, and 6.32% error, respectively. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to determine the optimal pattern of notches to achieve a desired nonuniform robot curvature. A simulated robot designed using the algorithm achieved the desired shape with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.52°. Additionally, we present a model for predicting the shape of nonuniformly notched continuum robots which incorporates friction and pre-curvature. This model predicted the shape of a continuum robot with nonuniform rectangular notches with an average RMSE of 5.20° with respect to the actual robot. We also demonstrated navigating the continuum robot through a pulmonary phantom.

### [A New Clustering-Based View Planning Method for Building Inspection with Drone]()

With the rapid development of drone technology, the application of drones equipped with visual sensors for building inspection and surveillance has attracted much attention. View planning aims to find a set of near-optimal viewpoints for vision-related tasks to achieve the vision coverage goal. This paper proposes a new clustering-based two-step computational method using spectral clustering, local potential field method, and hyper-heuristic algorithm to find near-optimal views to cover the target building surface. In the first step, the proposed method generates candidate viewpoints based on spectral clustering and corrects the positions of candidate viewpoints based on our newly proposed local potential field method. In the second step, the optimization problem is converted into a Set Covering Problem (SCP), and the optimal viewpoint subset is solved using our proposed hyper-heuristic algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to obtain better solutions with fewer viewpoints and higher coverage.

### [Towards the Deployment of an Autonomous Last-Mile Delivery Robot in Urban Areas]()

Nowadays, the skyrocketing last-mile freight transportation in urban areas is leading to very negative effects (e.g., pollution, noise or traffic congestion), which could be minimized by using autonomous electric vehicles. In this sense, this paper presents the first prototype of Ona, an autonomous last-mile delivery robot that, in contrast to existing platforms, has a medium-sized storage capacity with the capability of navigating in both street and pedestrian areas. Here, we describe the platform, its main Software modules and the validation experiments, carried out in the Barcelona Robot Lab (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya); Esplugues de Llobregat (next to Barcelona); and Debrecen (Hungary), which are representative urban scenarios. Apart from robotic technical details, we also include the results of the technology acceptance by the public present in the Esplugues de Llobregat test, collected in situ through a survey.

### [Multi-Heuristic Robotic Bin Packing of Regular and Irregular Objects]()

The increasing demand in e-commerce, combined with labor shortages and rising wages, is driving the rapid automation of warehouse operations. A critical aspect of this shift is bin packing, where diverse unknown items of varying sizes and shapes must be optimally arranged within a bin or container. Robot bin packing is receiving growing attention and presents unique challenges due to the broad range of objects, packing rules, and task-specific requirements. In response, we propose So-Pack, a generalist packing heuristic for irregularly shaped objects integrated into a flexible, weighted multi-heuristic planning system. The system demonstrates robust performance across general packing scenarios and exhibits the flexibility to adapt to changing packing rules and specific end-user requirements. Experimental results show that the system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in key metrics in a new challenging dataset of retail objects in real-world applications.

### [MultiTalk: Introspective and Extrospective Dialogue for Human-Environment-LLM Alignment]()

LLMs have shown promising results in task planning due to their strong natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, issues such as hallucinations, ambiguities in human instructions, environmental constraints, and limitations in the executing agent’s capabilities often lead to flawed or incomplete plans. This paper proposes MultiTalk, an LLM-based task planning methodology that addresses these issues through a framework of introspective and extrospective dialogue loops. This approach helps ground generated plans in the context of the environment and the agent's capabilities, while also resolving uncertainties and ambiguities in the given task. These loops are enabled by specialized systems designed to extract and predict task-specific states, and flag mismatches or misalignments among the human user, the LLM agent, and the environment. Effective feedback pathways between these systems and the LLM planner foster meaningful dialogue. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through its application to robotic manipulation tasks. Experiments and ablations highlight the robustness and reliability of our method, and comparisons with baselines further illustrate the superiority of MultiTalk in task planning for embodied agents.

### [Goal-Guided Reinforcement Learning: Leveraging Large Language Models for Long-Horizon Task Decomposition]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) has long struggled with exploration in vast state-action spaces, particularly for intricate tasks that necessitate a series of well-coordinated actions. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) equipped with fundamental knowledge have been utilized for task planning across various domains. However, using them to plan for long-term objectives can be demanding, as they function independently from task environments where their knowledge might not be perfectly aligned, hence often overlooking possible physical limitations. To this end, we propose a goal-based RL framework that leverages prior knowledge of LLMs to benefit the training process. We introduce a hierarchical module that features a goal generator to segment a long-horizon task into reachable subgoals and a policy planner to generate action sequences based on the current goal. Subsequently, the policies derived from LLMs guide the RL to achieve each subgoal sequentially. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across different simulation environments and long-horizon tasks with complex state and action spaces.

### [Trustworthy Robot Behavior Tree Generation Based on Multi-Source Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph]()

In robotics, the design of robot behavior trees generally requires roboticists to comprehensively and customizable consider all the relevant factors including the robot hardware capabilities, task descriptions, etc, posing great challenges for design quality and efficiency. The mainstream practice of BT design paradigm has been utilizing the BT component framework to develop task-specific BT structures manually. In contrast, the latest advances in Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) have also opened up the possibility of BT design automation. However, these approaches generally show low efficiency or are less trustworthy for complex robot task goals due to time-consuming manual design and unreliable GPT reasoning. To solve the above limitations, this paper proposes a novel knowledge-driven approach that develops a specialized knowledge graph from multi-sourced and heterogeneous high-quality robot knowledge to reason out a trustworthy robot plan for achieving complex task goals. Then we present the plan transformation and BT merging algorithms to automatically generate the plan-level BT structure. The comparative experiment results have shown that our approach can generate high-quality and trustworthy BT structure regarding the task plan accuracy and consistency, as well as the BT generation time, compared with the manual design and GPT-based approaches.

### [Enabling In-Flight Metamorphosis in Multirotors with a Center-Driven Scissor Extendable Airframe for Adaptive Navigation]()

To address complex mission tasks, multirotors benefit from in-flight reconfiguration that enhances their morphological adaptability. This paper presents the Center-Driven Scissor Extendable Airframe (CDSEA), a novel one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) morphing airframe designed to replace traditional fixed-size airframes. The CDSEA allows a quadrotor to achieve significant morphological changes during flight, with rotors deploying radially from a central point. This capability facilitates substantial variations in footprint radius and ensures smooth transitions. The paper details the mechanical design, as well as kinematic and dynamic analyses, and discusses the actuator selection strategy for the CDSEA. Experimental results with a prototype demonstrate that the CDSEA achieves a footprint-radius deformation ratio of 2.5 and a morphing time of 0.3 seconds, surpassing existing solutions. Additionally, the design improves obstacle avoidance and wind resistance. These results underscore the CDSEA's potential as an advanced solution for enhancing UAV adaptive navigation performance in complex environments.

### [SafePCA: Enhancing Autonomous Robot Navigation in Dynamic Crowds Using Proximal Policy Optimization and Cellular Automata]()

Navigating robots in dynamic environments, such as human crowds, is a major challenge due to the trade-off between performance and robustness. Traditional reinforcement learning methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), have shown strong adaptation capabilities but require extensive training and lack explicit mechanisms for collision avoidance. On the other hand, rule-based approaches, such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), offer computational efficiency but struggle with generalization to unseen crowd behaviors. The proposed SafePCA framework aims to address this trade-off by integrating Cellular Automata (CA) into PPO-based navigation. CA enhances robustness by predicting high-risk areas based on pedestrian movement patterns, reducing unnecessary collisions. However, this approach may lead to conservative behavior, potentially affecting navigation performance in reaching the goal efficiently. The core research question addressed in this work is whether SafePCA can balance these trade-offs to ensure safe yet efficient robot navigation in dynamic crowds. Experiments demonstrate that SafePCA outperforms traditional PPO by providing superior risk assessment and avoidance strategies, achieving optimal performance with fewer training episodes. SafePCA’s real-time adaptability ensures robust navigation in dynamic environments. By leveraging PPO’s adaptive learning and CA’s risk analysis, SafePCA offers an efficient solution for autonomous robot navigation in crowded environments, advancing the field and broadening application possibilities.

### [Robot Local Planner: A Periodic Sampling-Based Motion Planner with Minimal Waypoints for Home Environments]()

The objective of this study is to enable fast and safe manipulation tasks in home environments. Specifically, we aim to develop a system that can recognize its surroundings and identify target objects while in motion, enabling it to plan and execute actions accordingly. We propose a periodic sampling-based whole-body trajectory planning method, called the “Robot Local Planner (RLP).” This method leverages unique features of home environments to enhance computational efficiency, motion optimality, and robustness against recognition and control errors, all while ensuring safety. The RLP minimizes computation time by planning with minimal waypoints and generating safe trajectories. Furthermore, overall motion optimality is improved by periodically executing trajectory planning to select more optimal motions. This approach incorporates inverse kinematics that are robust to base position errors, further enhancing robustness.Evaluation experiments demonstrated that the RLP outperformed existing methods in terms of motion planning time, motion duration, and robustness, confirming its effectiveness in home environments. Moreover, application experiments using a tidy-up task achieved high success rates and short operation times, thereby underscoring its practical feasibility.

### [Diff-Refiner: Enhancing Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with a Plug-And-Play Diffusion Refiner]()

The inherent stochasticity of the agents’ behavior presents a challenge to trajectory prediction models, which are required to generate multiple plausible future trajectories. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to implement multimodal trajectory prediction. Existing approaches typically employ a standard diffusion process, denoising from a sample drawn from a Gaussian distribution. However, we identify that most agents exhibit an obvious movement trend, rendering many initial denoising steps redundant—primarily transitioning from pure noise to an initial coarse trajectory. To conquer this challenge, this paper innovatively proposes a diffusion refiner that can be used along with existing multi-agent trajectory prediction models to improve their performance. Specifically, we first leverage a baseline model for predicting the coarse future trajectory. Then, the diffusion model is applied as a refiner to reduce the prediction error. Moreover, our method is naturally plug-and-play, allowing convenient integration with existing models. To achieve this, we improve the traditional diffusion process to not only converge towards noise but also the coarse predictions from the baseline model. In such a case, standard step-skipping sampling techniques is inapplicable and we further propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based fast sampling method. Extensive experiments with selected baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [Scene-Aware Explainable Multimodal Trajectory Prediction]()

Advancements in intelligent technologies have significantly improved navigation in complex traffic environments by enhancing environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model’s effectiveness in learning accurate predictions. Code is available in our open-source repository: https://github. com/ocean-luna/Explainable-Prediction.

### [Safety-Critical Traffic Simulation with Adversarial Transfer of Driving Intentions]()

Traffic simulation, complementing real-world data with a long-tail distribution, allows for effective evaluation and enhancement of the ability of autonomous vehicles to handle accident-prone scenarios. Simulating such safety-critical scenarios is nontrivial, however, from log data that are typically regular scenarios, especially in consideration of dynamic adversarial interactions between the future motions of autonomous vehicles and surrounding traffic participants. To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and efficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving intentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and efficient safety-critical simulation. We formulate the adversarial transfer of driving intention as an optimization problem, facilitating extensive exploration of diverse attack behaviors and efficient solution convergence. Simultaneously, intention-conditioned motion planning benefits from powerful deep models and large-scale real-world data, permitting the simulation of realistic motion behaviors for actors. Specially, through adapting driving intentions based on environments, IntSim facilitates the flexible realization of dynamic adversarial interactions with autonomous vehicles. Finally, extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments on real-world datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that the proposed IntSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulating realistic safety-critical scenarios and further improves planners in handling such scenarios.

### [The Radiance of Neural Fields: Democratizing Photorealistic and Dynamic Robotic Simulation]()

As robots increasingly coexist with humans, they must navigate complex, dynamic environments rich in visual information and implicit social dynamics, like when to yield or move through crowds. Addressing these challenges requires significant advances in vision-based sensing and a deeper understanding of socio-dynamic factors, particularly in tasks like navigation. To facilitate this, robotics researchers need advanced simulation platforms offering dynamic, photorealistic environments with realistic actors. Unfortunately, most existing simulators fall short, prioritizing geometric accuracy over visual fidelity, and employing unrealistic agents with fixed trajectories and low-quality visuals. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simulator that incorporates three essential elements: (1) photorealistic neural rendering of environments, (2) neurally animated human entities with behavior management, and (3) an ego-centric robotic agent providing multi-sensor output. By utilizing advanced neural rendering techniques in a dual-NeRF simulator, our system produces high-fidelity, photorealistic renderings of both environments and human entities. Additionally, it integrates a state-of-the-art Social Force Model to model dynamic human-human and human-robot interactions, creating the first photorealistic and accessible human-robot simulation system powered by neural rendering.

### [Human-Robot Cooperative Distribution Coupling for Hamiltonian-Constrained Social Navigation]()

Navigating in human-filled public spaces is a critical challenge for deploying autonomous robots in real-world environments. This paper introduces NaviDIFF, a novel Hamiltonian-constrained socially-aware navigation framework designed to address the complexities of human-robot interaction and socially-aware path planning. NaviDIFF integrates a port-Hamiltonian framework to model dynamic physical interactions and a diffusion model to manage uncertainty in human-robot cooperation. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal transformer to capture social and temporal dependencies, enabling more accurate spatial-temporal environmental dynamics understanding and port-Hamiltonian physical interactive process construction. Additionally, reinforcement learning from human feedback is employed to fine-tune robot policies, ensuring adaptation to human preferences and social norms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviDIFF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in social navigation tasks, offering improved stability, efficiency, and adaptability.

### [Crowd Perception Communication-Based Multi-Agent Path Finding with Imitation Learning]()

Deep reinforcement learning-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention due to its remarkable adaptability to environments. Existing methods primarily leverage multi-agent communication in a fully-decentralized framework to maintain scalability while enhancing information exchange among agents. However, as the number of agents and obstacles increases, the environment becomes more complex, making cooperation between agents becomes more difficult, and crowding occurs from time to time. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized planner C3PIL, which integrates a Controlled Communication mechanism for Crowd Perception and uses Imitation Learning to improve policy learning. C3PIL first introduces a crowd perception communication module that perceives environmental crowd information and incorporates it into the controlled communication. This effectively prevents and mitigates crowded situations. Furthermore, we employ generative adversarial imitation learning to learn a reward function from expert experiences. It reduces the possible misleading caused by the fixed reward function, improves the flexibility and diversity of agent behaviors, and ultimately enables agents to cooperate effectively. Finally, experimental results show that C3PIL not only outperforms previous learning-based MAPF methods, but also further enhances the cooperation of agents and significantly reduces crowding in complex environments. The code is available at https://github.com/JJingXie/C3PIL.

### [TSPDiffuser: Diffusion Models As Learned Samplers for Traveling Salesperson Path Planning Problems]()

This paper presents TSPDiffuser, a novel data-driven path planner for traveling salesperson path planning problems (TSPPPs) in environments rich with obstacles. Given a set of destinations within obstacle maps, our objective is to efficiently find the shortest possible collision-free path that visits all the destinations. In TSPDiffuser, we train a diffusion model on a large collection of TSPPP instances and their respective solutions to generate plausible paths for unseen problem instances. The model can then be employed as a learned sampler to construct a roadmap that contains potential solutions with a small number of nodes and edges. This approach enables efficient and accurate estimation of travel costs between destinations, effectively addressing the primary computational challenge in solving TSPPPs. Experimental evaluations with diverse synthetic and real-world indoor/outdoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of TSPDiffuser over existing methods in terms of the trade-off between solution quality and computational time requirements.

### [Anticipatory Planning for Performant Long-Lived Robot in Large-Scale Home-Like Environments]()

We consider the setting where a robot must complete a sequence of tasks in a persistent large-scale environment, given one at a time. Existing task planners often operate myopically, focusing solely on immediate goals without considering the impact of current actions on future tasks. Anticipatory planning, which reduces the joint objective of the immediate planning cost of the current task and the expected cost associated with future subsequent tasks, offers an approach for improving long-lived task planning. However, applying anticipatory planning in large-scale environments presents significant challenges due to the sheer number of assets involved, which strains the scalability of learning and planning. In this research, we introduce a model-based anticipatory task planning framework designed to scale to large-scale realistic environments. Our framework uses a graph neural network (GNN) in particular via a representation inspired by a 3D scene graph to learn the essential properties of the environment crucial to estimating the state's expected cost and a sampling-based procedure for practical large-scale anticipatory planning. Our experimental results show that our planner reduces the cost of task sequence by 5.38% in home and 31.5% in restaurant settings. If given time to prepare in advance using our model reduces task sequence costs by 40.6% and 42.5%, respectively.

### [Scaling Diffusion Policy in Transformer to 1 Billion Parameters for Robotics Manipulation]()

Diffusion Policy is a powerful technique tool for learning end-to-end visuomotor robot control. It is expected that Diffusion Policy possesses scalability, a key attribute for deep neural networks, typically suggesting that increasing model size would lead to enhanced performance. However, our observations indicate that Diffusion Policy in transformer architecture (DP) struggles to scale effectively; even minor additions of layers can deteriorate training outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce Scalable Diffusion Transformer Policy for visuomotor learning. Our proposed method, namely textbf{methodname}, introduces two modules that improve the training dynamic of Diffusion Policy and allow the network to better handle multimodal action distribution. First, we identify that DP~suffers from large gradient issues, making the optimization of Diffusion Policy unstable. To resolve this issue, we factorize the feature embedding of observation into multiple affine layers, and integrate it into the transformer blocks. Additionally, our unmasking strategy allows the policy network to enquote{see} future actions during prediction, helping to reduce compounding errors. We demonstrate that our proposed method successfully scales the Diffusion Policy from 10 million to 1 billion parameters. This new model, named methodname, can effectively scale up the model size with improved performance and generalization. We benchmark methodname~across 50 different tasks from MetaWorld and find that our largest methodname~outperforms DP~with an average improvement of 21.6%. Across 7 real-world robot tasks, our ScaleDP demonstrates an average improvement of 22.5% over DP-T on four single-arm tasks and 66.7% on three bimanual tasks. We believe our work paves the way for scaling up models for visuomotor learning.

### [Implicit Contact Diffuser: Sequential Contact Reasoning with Latent Point Cloud Diffusion]()

Long-horizon contact-rich manipulation has long been a challenging problem, as it requires reasoning over both discrete contact modes and continuous object motion. We introduce Implicit Contact Diffuser (ICD), a diffusion-based model that generates a sequence of neural descriptors that specify a series of contact relationships between the object and the environment. This sequence is then used as guidance for an MPC method to accomplish a given task. The key advantage of this approach is that the latent descriptors provide more task- relevant guidance to MPC, helping to avoid local minima for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ICD outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as cable routing and notebook folding. Additionally, our experiments also indicate that ICD can generalize a target contact relationship to a different environment.

### [Diffusion Meets Options: Hierarchical Generative Skill Composition for Temporally-Extended Tasks]()

Safe and successful deployment of robots requires not only the ability to generate complex plans but also the capacity to frequently replan and correct execution errors. This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon trajectory planning under temporally extended objectives in a receding horizon manner. To this end, we propose DOPPLER, a data-driven hierarchical framework that generates and updates plans based on instruction specified by linear temporal logic (LTL). Our method decomposes temporal tasks into chain of options with hierarchical reinforcement learning from offline non-expert datasets. It leverages diffusion models to generate options with low-level actions. We devise a determinantal-guided posterior sampling technique during batch generation, which improves the speed and diversity of diffusion generated options, leading to more efficient querying. Experiments on robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that DOPPLER can generate sequences of trajectories that progressively satisfy the specified formulae for obstacle avoidance and sequential visitation.

### [PRESTO: Fast Motion Planning Using Diffusion Models Based on Key-Configuration Environment Representation]()

We introduce a learning-guided motion planning framework that generates seed trajectories using a diffusion model for trajectory optimization. Given a workspace, our method approximates the configuration space (C-space) obstacles through an environment representation consisting of a sparse set of task-related key configurations, which is then used as a conditioning input to the diffusion model. The diffusion model integrates regularization terms that encourage smooth, collision-free trajectories during training, and trajectory optimization refines the generated seed trajectories to correct any colliding segments. Our experimental results demonstrate that high-quality trajectory priors, learned through our C-space-grounded diffusion model, enable the efficient generation of collision-free trajectories in narrow-passage environments, outperforming previous learning- and planning-based baselines. Videos and additional materials can be found on the project page: https://kiwi-sherbet.github.io/PRESTO.

### [Demonstration Data-Driven Parameter Adjustment for Trajectory Planning in Highly Constrained Environments]()

Trajectory planning in highly constrained environments is crucial for robotic navigation. Classical algorithms are widely used for their interpretability, generalization, and system robustness. However, these algorithms often require parameter retuning when adapting to new scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a demonstration data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) method for automatic parameter adjustment. Our approach includes two main components: a front-end policy network and a back-end asynchronous controller. The policy network selects appropriate parameters for the trajectory planner, while a discriminator in a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) evaluates the planned trajectory, using this evaluation as an imitation reward in RL. The asynchronous controller is employed for high-frequency trajectory tracking. Experiments conducted in both simulation and realworld demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the performance of classical algorithms.

### [VLM-Social-Nav: Socially Aware Robot Navigation through Scoring Using Vision-Language Models]()

We propose VLM-Social-Nav, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) based navigation approach to compute a robot's motion in human-centered environments. Our goal is to make real-time decisions on robot actions that are socially compliant with human expectations. We utilize a perception model to detect important social entities and prompt a VLM to generate guidance for socially compliant robot behavior. VLM-Social-Nav uses a VLM-based scoring module that computes a cost term that ensures socially appropriate and effective robot actions generated by the underlying planner. Our overall approach reduces reliance on large training datasets and enhances adaptability in decision-making. In practice, it results in improved socially compliant navigation in human-shared environments. We demonstrate and evaluate our system in four different real-world social navigation scenarios with a Turtlebot robot. We observe at least 27.38% improvement in the average success rate and 19.05% improvement in the average collision rate in the four social navigation scenarios. Our user study score shows that VLM-Social-Nav generates the most socially compliant navigation behavior.

### [Talk2Radar: Bridging Natural Language with 4D mmWave Radar for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension]()

Embodied perception is essential for intelligent vehicles and robots in interactive environmental understanding. However, these advancements primarily focus on vision, with limited attention given to using 3D modeling sensors, restricting a comprehensive understanding of objects in response to prompts containing qualitative and quantitative queries. Recently, as a promising automotive sensor with affordable cost, 4D millimeter-wave radars provide denser point clouds than conventional radars and perceive both semantic and physical characteristics of objects, thereby enhancing the reliability of perception systems. To foster the development of natural language-driven context understanding in radar scenes for 3D visual grounding, we construct the first dataset, Talk2Radar, which bridges these two modalities for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Talk2Radar contains 8,682 referring prompt samples with 20,558 referred objects. Moreover, we propose a novel model, T-RadarNet, for 3D REC on point clouds, achieving State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on the Talk2Radar dataset compared to counterparts. Deformable-FPN and Gated Graph Fusion are meticulously designed for efficient point cloud feature modeling and cross-modal fusion between radar and text features, respectively. Comprehensive experiments provide deep insights into radar-based 3D REC. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Talk2Radar.

### [Improving Generalization Ability for 3D Object Detection by Learning Sparsity-Invariant Features]()

In autonomous driving, 3D object detection is essential for accurately identifying and tracking objects. Despite the continuous development of various technologies for this task, a significant drawback is observed in most of them—they experience substantial performance degradation when detecting objects in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the generalization ability for 3D object detection on a single domain. We primarily focus on generalizing from a single source domain to target domains with distinct sensor configurations and scene distributions. To learn sparsity-invariant features from a single source domain, we selectively subsample the source data to a specific beam, using confidence scores determined by the current detector to identify the density that holds utmost importance for the detector. Subsequently, we employ the teacher-student framework to align the Bird's Eye View (BEV) features for different point clouds densities. We also utilize feature content alignment (FCA) and graph-based embedding relationship alignment (GERA) to instruct the detector to be domain-agnostic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to other baselines. Furthermore, our approach even outperforms certain domain adaptation methods that can access to the target domain data. The code is available at https://github.com/Tiffamy/3DOD-LSF.

### [Camera-Lidar Consistent Neural Radiance Fields]()

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a leading technique for novel view synthesis, with promising applications in robotics. However, due to shape-radiance ambiguity, NeRFs often require additional depth inputs for regularization in outdoor scenarios. LiDAR provides accurate depth measurements, but current methods typically combine only a few frames, resulting in sparse depth maps and discrepancies with camera images. The asynchronous nature of LiDAR, where each point is captured at a different timestamp, introduces depth inaccuracies when treated as simultaneous. These errors, along with inherent LiDAR noise, create inconsistencies that hinder reconstruction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous-time framework for joint Camera- LiDAR optimization, enabling more consistent radiance field reconstruction and improving both view synthesis and geometric accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce a continuoustime framework for joint Camera-LiDAR optimization, aiming to consistently reconstruct the radiance field for better view synthesis and geometric accuracy.

### [Iterative Volume Fusion for Asymmetric Stereo Matching]()

Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching (IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

### [OccRWKV: Rethinking Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction with Linear Complexity]()

3D semantic occupancy prediction networks have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reconstructing the geometric and semantic structure of 3D scenes, providing crucial information for robot navigation and autonomous driving systems. However, due to their large overhead from dense network structure designs, existing networks face challenges balancing accuracy and latency. In this paper, we introduce OccRWKV, an efficient semantic occupancy network inspired by Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV). OccRWKV separates semantics, occupancy prediction, and feature fusion into distinct branches, each incorporating Sem-RWKV and Geo-RWKV blocks. These blocks are designed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the network to learn domain-specific representation (i.e., semantics and geometry), which enhances prediction accuracy. Leveraging the sparse nature of real-world 3D occupancy, we reduce computational overhead by projecting features into the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and propose a BEV-RWKV block for efficient feature enhancement and fusion. This enables real-time inference at 22.2 FPS without compromising performance. Experiments demonstrate that OccRWKV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving a mIoU of 25.1 while being 20 times faster than the best baseline, Co-Occ, making it suitable for real-time deployment on robots to enhance autonomous navigation efficiency. Code and video are available on our project page: https://jmwang0117.github.io/OccRWKV/.

### [ZSORN: Language-Driven Object-Centric Zero-Shot Object Retrieval and Navigation]()

In this paper, we present ZSORN, a novel language-driven object-centric image representation for object retrieval and navigation task within complex scenes. We propose an object centric image representation and corresponding losses for visual-language model (VLM) fine-tuning, which can handle complex object-level queries. In addition, we design a novel LLM-based augmentation and prompt templates for stability during training and zero-shot inference. We implement our method on Astro robot and deploy it in both simulated and real-world environments for zero-shot object navigation. We show that our proposed method can achieve an improvement of 1.38 - 13.38% in terms of text-to-image recall on different benchmark settings for the retrieval task. For object navigation, we show the benefit of our approach in simulation and real world, showing 5% and 16.67% improvement in terms of navigation success rate, respectively.

### [PRIDEV: A Plug-And-Play Refinement for Improved Depth Estimation in Videos]()

Monocular video depth estimation is a key challenge in computer vision, highlighting its importance in visual understanding. Monocular depth estimation models trained on single images achieve impressive results on individual frames but often lack temporal consistency when applied to videos, leading to flickering and artifacts. Current video depth estimation methods often rely on additional optical flow or camera poses, which are limited by their accuracy, carefullydesigned, and lack robustness. Specially, we propose a plug-and-play method that seamlessly transfers the robustness of image depth estimation to video depth estimation. By leveraging powerful priors from image depth estimation, our method enhances the performance of video depth estimation without requiring additional conditional inputs or extensive pretraining on large and expensive video datasets. We introduce the Temporal Depth Stabilization Module (TDSM), which can seamlessly inflate an image monocular depth estimation model into a video depth estimation model, enabling unified modeling of depth across video sequences and capturing the temporal cues in video. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method across various datasets (e.g., normal and challenging conditions) and different backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple and effective method significantly improves monocular depth estimation networks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

### [Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes for Hybrid Meta-Reinforcement Learning]()

We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes (UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

### [Efficient Online Learning of Contact Force Models for Connector Insertion]()

Contact-rich manipulation tasks with stiff frictional elements, like connector insertion, are difficult to model with rigid-body simulators. In this work, we propose a new approach for modeling these environments by learning a quasi-static contact force model instead of a full simulator. Using a feature vector that contains information about the configuration and control, we find a linear mapping adequately captures the relationship between this feature vector and the sensed contact forces. A novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm is used to solve for the globally optimal mapping in real time without any matrix inversions, resulting in an algorithm that runs in nearly constant time on a GPU as the model size increases. We validate the proposed approach for connector insertion in both simulation and hardware experiments, where the learned model is combined with an optimization-based impedance controller to achieve smooth insertions in the presence of misalignments and uncertainty. Our website featuring videos, code, and more materials is available at https://model-based-plugging.github.io/.

### [Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations Using Learning-Based Model Predictive Control]()

Flying quadrotors in tight formations is a challenging problem. It is known that in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced by the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine learning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these effects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the resulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles counterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits of first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an accurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects resulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within our model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control design. Through simulations and physical experiments, we show that incorporating the model into a novel learning-based nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework results in substantial performance improvements in terms of trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. In particular, our framework significantly outperforms nominal MPC in physical experiments, achieving a 40.1% improvement in the average trajectory tracking errors and a 57.5% reduction in the maximum vertical separation errors. Our framework also achieves exceptional sample efficiency, using only a total of 46 seconds of flight data for training across both simulations and physical experiments. Furthermore, with our proposed framework, the quadrotors achieve an exceptionally tight formation, flying with an average separation of less than 1.5 body lengths throughout the flight.

### [Learning Based MPC for Autonomous Driving Using a Low Dimensional Residual Model]()

In this paper, a learning based Model Predictive Control (MPC) using a low dimensional residual model is proposed for autonomous driving. One of the critical challenge in autonomous driving is the complexity of vehicle dynamics, which impedes the formulation of accurate vehicle model. Inaccurate vehicle model can significantly impact the performance of MPC controller. To address this issue, this paper decomposes the nominal vehicle model into invariable and variable elements. The accuracy of invariable elements are ensured by calibration, while the deviations in the variable elements are learned by a low-dimensional residual model. The features of residual model are selected as the physical variables most correlated with nominal model errors. Physical constraints among these features are formulated to explicitly define the valid region within the feature space. The formulated model and constraints are incorporated into the MPC framework and validated through both simulation and real vehicle experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly enhances the model accuracy and controller performance.

### [Modeling of Deformable Linear Objects under Incomplete State Information]()

The robot-based tracking of highly dynamic end point motions of deformable linear objects (DLO) remains challenging due to its non-linear behavior. Since simple feedback control is infeasible, model-based control offers potential to account for the non-linear effects, but requires computation efficient and accurate models. Promising results have been achieved utilizing data-driven models that introduce a latent kinematic chain as model of the DLO and mapping measurements of the tip position in its latent joint space, in which the dynamic motion model is learned. So far, this approach has the limitation that it can not handle situations of incomplete sensory information, for instance if occlusion occurs. Consequently, this paper introduces a fusion network architecture capable of making predictions even if sensory information is incomplete. We achieve additional state estimation of the latent joint state by learning a data driven inverse kinematics with help of wrench measurements at the DLO base and evaluate our approach by simulating occlusion. We demonstrate the computational effectiveness of our approach for in the loop control tasks.

This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems, with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.

### [Plug-And-Play Physics-Informed Learning Using Uncertainty Quantified Port-Hamiltonian Models]()

The ability to predict trajectories of surrounding agents and obstacles is a crucial component in many robotic applications. Data-driven approaches are commonly adopted for state prediction in scenarios where the underlying dynamics are unknown. However, the performance, reliability, and uncertainty of data-driven predictors become compromised when encountering out-of-distribution observations relative to the training data. In this paper, we introduce a Plug-and-Play Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PnP-PIML) framework to address this challenge. Our method employs conformal prediction to identify outlier dynamics and, in that case, switches from a nominal predictor to a physics-consistent model, namely distributed Port-Hamiltonian systems (dPHS). We leverage Gaussian processes to model the energy function of the dPHS, enabling not only the learning of system dynamics but also the quantification of predictive uncertainty through its Bayesian nature. In this way, the proposed framework produces reliable physics-informed predictions even for the out-of-distribution scenarios.

### [Robust Proximal Adversarial Reinforcement Learning under Model Mismatch]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) can generate high-performance control policies for complex tasks in simulation through an end-to-end approach. However, the RL policy is not robust to uncertainties caused by modeling mismatch between simulation and real environments, making it difficult to transfer to the real world. In response to the above challenge, this letter introduces a lightweight and efficient robust RL algorithm. The algorithm transforms the optimization objective of the adversary from a long-term cumulative reward to a short-term reward, making the adversary focus on the performance in the near future. Additionally, the adversarial actions are projected onto a finite subset within the perturbation space using projected gradient descent, effectively constraining the adversary's strength and obtaining more robust policies. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real environments show that our algorithm improves the generalization ability of the policy for the modeling mismatch, outperforming the next best prior methods across almost all environments.

### [Loopy Movements: Emergence of Rotation in a Multicellular Robot Demonstration]()

Unlike most engineered systems, biological systems often
exhibit emergent behaviors rooted in simple local
interactions, enabling them to remain adaptable and
resilient in complex environments. Inspired by these
principles, this work demonstrates a decentralized,
emergent rotation in Loopy, a multicellular robot composed
of homogeneous, physically linked, one-degree-of-freedom
cells. Each cell simulates local chemical reactions,
diffusion, and active transport of morphogens without
centralized control or awareness of the overall robot
shape. Through these interactions, Loopy self-organizes
into lobed morphologies that rotate, with each cell moving
counter to the macroscopic structure. We investigate (1)
how these local rules generate rotational motion, (2) the
effect of morphology on motion, and (3) the system’s
tolerance to actuator failure. Experiments reveal that
changing lobe size or count redistributes angular
velocities between the cells and overall morphology, and
Loopy maintains rotation despite losing up to one-third of
its actuators. These findings highlight the potential of
bio-inspired, bottom-up strategies for building robust,
adaptive robotic systems.

### [Pipe-Like Joints & Single-Carrier Compound Gearbox (SCCG)]()

Abstract - In the ever-evolving field of robotics, the
continuous exploration and testing of new ideas and
approaches in hardware design are essential for driving
innovation and improving performance. Sometimes,
innovation comes from reconsidering and improving upon
designs that were developed in the past but did
not achieve widespread adoption. This exhibition proposes a
reconsideration of one such development: the
concept of coordinated rotary joints in robotic systems,
introduced in the early 1980s by renowned Japanese
roboticist Professor Hirose Satoshi.
The design of these coordinated rotary joints, where
multiple rotary joints work in unison to achieve a
combined bending movement, creates hollow, pipe-like
structures that enable efficient force transmission
through the walls while offering a continuous exterior
surface. The efficient force transmission and pipe-like
shape make these joints ideal for multi-redundant
inspection robot arms. The hollow space and continuous
surface also make them highly suitable for exoskeletons and
pressurized suits. Additionally, the absence of
overlapping external surfaces makes these joints easy to
clean and sterilize, while preventing damage to
fingers, plants, or other surrounding elements. These
features make the joints particularly advantageous in
applications requiring interaction with humans or delicate
environments, such as medical or service robots.
Our patented improvement to these Pipe-Like joints involves
a compact...

### [The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-Based Balancing, Flips, and Articulated Driving (EXPO Proposal)]()

The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle
robot designed as a testbed for learning-based control. It
is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics,
non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a
small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot
can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation
– enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive
experiments and even challenging half flips. With imitation
learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic
effects, the Mini Wheelbot can reorient and track
higher-level velocity and orientation commands. This allows
the
robot to drive around based on user commands – for the
first time in this class of robots.
At the ICRA 2025 EXPO, we showcase the Mini Wheelbots
automatic environment reset and intriguing nonlinear yaw
control to convince the robotics community that the robot
is not only compelling for testing learning-based control
algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with. The
supplementary video of our paper shows the experiments we

### [Lighter-Than-Air Robotic Platform for Energy-Efficient Autonomy]()

Robotic blimps, unlike other types of aerial vehicles,
leverage buoyancy from lighter-than-air gases such as
helium to prolong their flight duration. In addition, the
typical flexibility of LTA gas containers, such as
balloons, makes them inherently safer in collisions, ideal
for environments with humans or sensitive equipment. These
unique characteristics advocate their potential
applications in surveillance, environmental monitoring, and
human-centered robotics. This demonstration presents two different robotic
micro-blimps implemented using the same open-source
software-hardware framework. We propose demonstrating their
real-time manual and autonomous operation to highlight the
scalability, energy efficiency, and independence from an
external infrastructure of the framework. It features a
customizable hardware and software stack, a detachable
perception module, and robust communication protocols that
allow one base station to coordinate up to 20 blimps. The
Mochi is the default blimp construct, designed for
autonomous pickup-and-delivery tasks. The Spinning Blimp
showcases a custom modification that achieves stable flight
through a novel spin actuation mechanism. Its design allows
for pendulum-like passive stabilization through continuous
rotation. The demo includes side-by-side operation of both
platforms, demonstrating the onboard detection and autonomy
of the Mochi, and continuous flight stability of the
Spinning Blimp. Expo audiences are encouraged to interact

### [Interactive Teleoperation of Simulated Space Robots]()

Robots play an increasingly critical role in the future of
space exploration. Whether it is fleets of autonomous
rovers exploring planetary surfaces or robotic manipulators
constructing large orbital structures, technological
advances in this domain will be vital for the success of
envisioned missions. However, developing and validating
flight-ready robotic systems is challenging due to the
limited availability of extraterrestrial data and the
prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations.
High-fidelity simulations offer a solution for bridging
this gap. Yet, the majority of simulators developed for
space applications are limited in scope or unavailable to
the general public. To address these challenges, we present
the Space Robotics Bench (SRB), an open-source simulation
platform that provides a collection of diverse environments
and tasks across various space application domains. To
simulate the vast diversity of unpredictable space
environments, SRB integrates procedural generation and
domain randomization. For ICRA Expo 2025, we aim to
demonstrate the features of SRB through an interactive
experience in which participants can teleoperate robots
across multiple space-relevant scenarios. Additionally,
participants will be able to compare their performance
against a reinforcement learning agent, highlighting the
importance of robust autonomy in the presence of
communication latency and environmental uncertainties that
are inherent to all operations beyond Earth.

### [Hopcopter - the Most Agile Jumping Robot]()

Nature demonstrates remarkable examples of animals that
excel by combining flight and ground movement. Inspired by
this multimodal approach, we've developed an innovative
hybrid robot that both hops and flies efficiently. Our
design integrates a nano quadcopter with a passive
telescopic leg, moving beyond traditional jumping robots
that require active leg actuation during the stance phase.
We developed specific thrust controls and removable
aerodynamic surfaces that allow the robot to perform
sequential jumps with or without position feedback. This
configuration allows for adjustable jump heights and
minimizes time spent on the ground, creating nimble hopping
movement. In testing, our robot achieved average vertical
hopping speeds of 2.38 m/s and reached heights of 1.63
meters. The multimodal capability enables mid-flight jumps
that produce rapid accelerations and direction changes,
significantly improving maneuverability in challenging
environments. The passive leg mechanism shows promise for
integration with standard rotorcraft, potentially enabling
seamless transitions between hopping and flying modes.

### [A Wheel-Gripper: Enabling Multifunctionality through Factorability]()

Manipulation with legs on multi-pedal robots is not a new
concept, but it has rarely been considered on wheel-legged
robots due to their mechanical structure. This paper
presents a mechanism that transitions between a wheel and a
gripper, allowing wheel-legged robots to perform
manipulation tasks with their legs. The mechanism uses the
same motor for both wheeled locomotion and gripping, and no
new actuator is needed for transitioning.
It is capable of storing small objects, liquid, or soil
while still functioning as a wheel. 
Our analysis showed that those distinctive modes
corresponded to the factors of the complex kinematics
polynomials of the mechanism. The two modes exist because
the polynomials that govern the mechanism's kinematics
factor.  That is to say, its overall motion is the union of
two lower degree irreducible components. A single-leg
platform was built to demonstrate its ability to grasp
objects and collect water or soil samples, and explore its
capability as a contact force sensor through experiments.
Such a design could enable wheel-legged robots to perform
more diverse loco-manipulation tasks without installing
additional limbs.

This demo presents GelSLAM, a real-time, tactile-based SLAM
system for object pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.
Using only tactile sensing, GelSLAM achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy in both tracking and 3D reconstruction. Its
precise pose estimation enhances robot dexterity by
enabling real-time action adjustments during tasks such as
grasping, in-hand manipulation, tool use, and assembly.
Beyond robotics, GelSLAM’s high-resolution reconstructions
in the wild benefit fields like biology, geology, and
archaeology—capturing objects such as seeds, rocks, and
artifacts without lighting constraints, and even when they
are transparent or specular.

open-source robotics platform designed to advance research
and education in reinforcement learning (RL) and
learning-based control. Based on the classic labyrinth
game, CyberRunner encapsulates the rich dynamics of
real-world environments while maintaining simplicity,
reproducibility, and affordability. Further, we demonstrate
how model-based RL techniques can be employed to achieve
superhuman performance on the physical labyrinth game.

### [A Direct-Drive Gripper Designed by Ellipse Synthesis across Two Output Modes]()

There are many ways for a gripper to estimate the forces
between its fingers.
If powered by direct-drive brushless motors, then one
technique is to measure their current.
This is not the most accurate technique, but it is simple,
keeps the sensor remote, and requires no new components.
The estimation involves multiplying current signals through
by the torque constant and the inverse transpose of the
Jacobian.
The Jacobian either amplifies the signal from fingertip
force to motor current (at the cost of tip force
production), or diminishes it (with the gain of tip force
production), indicating an inherent trade-off.
However, the Jacobian is a function of configuration, and
for any workspace point there are multiple configurations
(multiple inverse kinematics solutions), therefore a
selection of Jacobian exists.
For a given workspace point, the number of Jacobian choices
is just a few, (equal to the number inverse kinematics
solutions), 
but these choices can be designed (through dimensional
synthesis) to overcome the trade-off.
The problem can be framed as velocity ellipse synthesis
over multiple output modes.
In this work, we conduct optimal synthesis to compute a new
gripper design.
The gripper was built and tested.
It transitions between two different modes: sense mode and
grip mode.
Sense mode can sense forces 3 times smaller than grip mode.
Grip mode can exert forces 4 times greater than sense mode.

### [RUKA Robot Hand Teleoperation with Learned Controls]()

Dexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability for
robotic systems, yet progress has been limited by hardware
trade-offs between precision, compactness, strength, and
affordability. Existing control methods impose these
compromises on hand designs and applications. However,
learning-based approaches present opportunities to rethink
these trade-offs. In this interactive demo, we present
RUKA, a tendon-driven robotic hand that is compact,
affordable, and capable, made possible by the use of
learned controls. Made from 3D-printed parts and
off-the-shelf components, RUKA has 5 fingers with 15
underactuated degrees of freedom, enabling diverse
human-like grasps. Using motion-capture data collected with
the MANUS glove (manus-meta.com), we learn
joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-actuator models for
controlling RUKA. During the demo, attendees will
teleoperate RUKA using the MANUS glove. They will have the
opportunity to try classic tasks with a variety of objects.
RUKA’s open-source design, assembly instructions, code, and
data are available at ruka-hand.github.io.

### [Smart Foot System for Enhanced Robot Mobility on Challenging Terrains]()

Robotic platforms mainly focus on locomoting and operating
in structured environments such as homes, factory settings,
highways and streets etc. These robots can navigate
reliably in relatively predictable and controlled settings
by relying on predictable ground interactions to perform
various tasks. However, robots must also achieve stable
locomotion in unpredictable, and challenging terrain such
as natural environments and hazardous areas where human
operation is difficult, enabling tasks such as exploration,
load carrying, and infrastructure maintenance. Flowable and
deformable surfaces that can deform unpredictably under
stress such as sandy deserts, snowy mountains and
extraterrestrial environments pose great challenges for
robot locomotion.
We designed smart foot systems that incorporates plates
(cleats) extending perpendicularly from the bottom of the
foot to manipulate deformable surfaces for efficient
robotic locomotion. By integrating a motor-controlled
mechanism, the cleats can be extended and retracted,
allowing the feet to engage or disengage with the
deformable terrain. Cleat interaction significantly
improves mobility efficiency in deformable and flowable
environments by enhancing traction and stability. In
addition, the motor-controlled cleat length adjustment
enables seamless transitions between soft (penetrable) and
rigid surfaces. The ability to regulate and manipulate the
flow and deformation of soft, flowable surfaces via cleat
extension—while smoothly tr

### [Ground Control Robotics ICRA 2025 Demo Proposal]()

Multi-legged, undulatory robots possess many advantageous
properties for locomotion over unstructured and crowded
terrain including low profiles and robustness to missing
foot contacts. Despite these advantages, coordinating a
high number of legs (6+) and body joints represents a many
degree of freedom control problem that has limited their
practical and commercial viability. Ground Control Robotics
LLC. (GCR), in collaboration with researchers at Georgia
Tech, seeks to commercialize these systems for agricultural
use by advancing robophysical theories and developing
robust mechanical systems to explore the capabilities of
these robots in locomotion, navigation, and obstacle
negotiation. Recent successes include the development of
steering gaits, IMU-assisted automatic self righting,
tactile feedback enhanced locomotion for climbing, and
antenna sensing. Specifically, GCR has developed a flagship
commercial platform (Major Tom) that is a 5 link myriapod.
Major Tom aims to be a low cost, all terrestrial
alternative for weeding, pest control, and agricultural
data collection.

### [Multimodal Perception with Legged Mobile Manipulator for Visual, Thermal, and Radiation Monitoring]()

The proposal presents a multimodal robotic platform for
remote visual, thermal, and radiation monitoring in
hazardous or unknown environments. The system integrates a
Unitree B1 quadruped robot with a Unitree Z1 robotic arm to
create a mobile and semi-autonomous perception platform.
Equipped with a Teledyne FLIR Hadron 640R, which integrates
a long-wave infrared (thermal) camera and a 1080p
visible-light imaging sensor, along with an SPRD-ER gamma
radiation detector, the robot fuses visual, thermal, and
radiation data for real-time monitoring and environmental
awareness. Sensor fusion and SLAM are performed onboard
using ROS, and the resulting data is streamed wirelessly to
a remote PC for real-time visualization and operator
monitoring. While the robot is primarily teleoperated, it
can autonomously perform simple tasks such as environmental
scanning and predefined manipulations via the Z1 arm. This platform demonstrates a perception pipeline that
extends beyond vision-based sensing by incorporating
multiple physical modalities, including ionizing radiation
and heat signatures, thus enabling richer scene
understanding and opening pathways for advanced research in
multimodal robotic perception. The demonstration will
include a representative monitoring scenario using heated
and cooled sealed containers to simulate thermal anomalies.
A low-energy, non-harmful radiation source may be placed in
the environment to demonstrate detection and localization;

### [Sea Turtle-Inspired Adaptive Gait Strategies for Multi-Terrain Robotic Locomotion]()

Robotic locomotion in complex and unstructured environments
presents significant challenges, requiring unconventional
designs that incorporate mechanical intelligence and
bioinspired design. Inspired by the adaptive locomotion of
sea turtle hatchlings, we designed a bioinspired
flipper-based
robotic system to traverse soft and irregular terrains. Our
robot features an oval-shaped body and four independently
actuated flippers (rigid or soft), combined with adaptive
control strategies that adjust gait patterns in real time.
We demonstrate effective locomotion on dry and wet sand,
foam stairs, rocky surfaces, and inclined terrains,
achieving high displacement and energy efficiency. These
results showcase the potential of flipper-based mobility
systems for search and rescue, planetary exploration, and
other off-road robotic missions.

interactive demo features: (1) Live egocentric video
streaming from Project Aria glasses capturing human
demonstrations.(2) Policy execution on ’Eve’, our low-cost,
humanoid-style bimanual robot performing contact-rich tasks

### [Planar Locomotion of Soft Robots Equipped with Microspine Arrays]()

Microspine grippers are small spines commonly found on
insect legs that reinforce surface interaction by engaging
with asperities to increase traction. An array of such
microspines, when integrated into the limbs of a robot, can
provide the ability to maneuver uneven terrains, traverse
inclines, and even climb walls. Meanwhile, the
conformability of soft robots makes them ideal candidates
for applications involving traversal of complex,
unstructured terrains. However, there remains a real-life
realization gap transitioning from controlled lab
environment to the field that can be bridged by improving
grip stability through effective integration of
microspines. In this robot demo, a passive, compliant
microspine stacked array design is proposed to enhance the
locomotion capabilities of mobile soft robots. A microspine
array integration method effectively addresses the
stiffness mismatch between soft, compliant, and rigid
components. Additionally, a reduction in complexity results
from actuation of the surface-conformable soft limb using a
single actuator. The two-row, stacked microspine array
configuration offers improved gripping capabilities on
steep and irregular surfaces. This design is incorporated
into three different robot configurations - the baseline
without microspines and two others with different
combinations of microspine arrays. In-person demonstrations
will be conducted on varying surfaces such as rocks,
carpet, and a rubber mat.

### [Coordinating Spinal and Limb Dynamics for Enhanced Sprawling Robot Mobility]()

Salamanders, with their ability to switch between walking
and swimming, showcase how spinal flexibility enhances
locomotion. Their undulating body motion helps them move
over uneven terrain and adapt to unpredictable
environments. Inspired by this, we explore control
strategies for a salamander-like robot with two
configurations: one with a fixed spine and one with an
active, flexible spine. We compare biologically inspired gaits and learning-based
approaches under different scenarios to see how well each
performs. Our findings show that combining models like the
Hildebrand gait with deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
leads to more robust and efficient movement. Building on
this, we developed a modular Hopf oscillator-based CPG
framework, which successfully generates coordinated
locomotion across multiple limbs. This work is part of our
ongoing effort to merge the adaptability of DRL with the
rhythmic stability of CPGs for better performance in
real-world conditions.

### [Light Following Robophysical Space Rover with Closed-Loop Gait Strategies at Granular Slope]()

Exploring extraterrestrial environments requires planetary
rovers to gather data and conduct experiments on
challenging terrains like steep granular slopes, obstacles,
and craters. To overcome these difficulties, modern rovers
have leg-like movement systems that can lift, sweep, and
spin their wheels; such a mechanism can apply selective
substrate fluidization by changing the sweep and spin speed
of wheels to generate effective thrust. Previously, optimum
open-loop gaits using selective fluidization for forward
locomotion and in-place rotation are discovered on granular
slopes. However, real-life exploration entails dealing with
more intricate locomotion scenarios, such as maneuvering in
deformable, flowable, extensive granular slopes with
challenging approach configurations. To address this, we
utilize a 30 cm-long laboratory-scale robophysical rover
model on a tiltable fluidizing testbed containing poppy
seeds. We propose a new gait capable of moving laterally
while moving forward, by limiting the sweep angle and
turning speed of the wheels on one side of the robot; this
generates torque asymmetry between the sides of the robot's
sagittal plane. In addition, we present a closed-loop gait
sequencing algorithm that switches between small direction
corrections, sharp in-place rotations and self-burial
movements to follow an externally imposed moving light
source. Using these strategies, we succeed in following
closed trajectories up to 15-degree granular slopes.

### [DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning Using Large Language Models]()

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

### [Hey Robot! Personalizing Robot Navigation through Model Predictive Control with a Large Language Model]()

Robot navigation methods allow mobile robots to operate in applications such as warehouses or hospitals. While the environment in which the robot operates imposes requirements on its navigation behavior, most existing methods do not allow the end-user to configure the robot's behavior and priorities, possibly leading to undesirable behavior (e.g., fast driving in a hospital). We propose a novel approach to adapt robot motion behavior based on natural language instructions provided by the end-user. Our zero-shot method uses an existing Visual Language Model to interpret a user text query or an image of the environment. This information is used to generate the cost function and reconfigure the parameters of a Model Predictive Controller, translating the user's instruction to the robot's motion behavior. This allows our method to safely and effectively navigate in dynamic and challenging environments. We extensively evaluate our method's individual components and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a ground robot in simulation and real-world experiments, and across a variety of environments and user specifications.

### [Large Language Model Based Autonomous Task Planning for Abstract Commands]()

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities in natural language processing, sparking interest in applying LLMs to task planning problems in robotics. Most studies focused on task planning for clear natural language commands that specify target objects and their locations. However, for more user-friendly task execution, it is crucial for robots to autonomously plan and carry out tasks based on abstract natural language commands that may not explicitly mention target objects or locations, such as ‘Put the food ingredients in the same place.’ In this study, we propose an LLM-based autonomous task planning framework that generates task plans for abstract natural language commands. This framework consists of two phases: an environment recognition phase and a task planning phase. In the environment recognition phase, a large vision-language model generates a hierarchical scene graph that captures the relationships between objects and spaces in the environment surrounding a robot agent. During the task planning phase, an LLM uses the scene graph and the abstract user command to formulate a plan for the given task. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the AI2THOR simulation environment, demonstrating its superior performance in task execution when handling abstract commands.

### [Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models]()

In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-corrective planning of tasks with inverse prompting, named InversePrompt, which contains reasoning steps to provide interpretable groundings for feedback. It generates the inverse actions corresponding to generated actions and verifies if these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, thereby explicitly validating the logical flow of the generated plans. The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.

### [Traffic Regulation-Aware Path Planning with Regulation Databases and Vision-Language Models]()

This paper introduces and tests a framework that integrates traffic regulation compliance into automated driving systems (ADS). The framework enables ADS to follow traffic laws and make informed decisions based on the driving environment. Using RGB camera inputs and a vision-language model (VLM), the system generates descriptive text to support a regulation-aware decision-making process, ensuring legal and safe driving practices. This information is combined with a machine-readable ADS regulation database to guide future driving plans within legal constraints. Key features include: 1) a regulation database supporting ADS decision-making, 2) an automated process using sensor input for regulation-aware path planning, and 3) validation in both simulated and real-world environments. Particularly, the real-world vehicle tests not only assess the framework's performance but also evaluate the potential and challenges of VLMs to solve complex driving problems by integrating detection, reasoning, and planning. This work enhances the legality, safety, and public trust in ADS, representing a significant step forward in the field.

### [DrPlanner: Diagnosis and Repair of Motion Planners for Automated Vehicles Using Large Language Models]()

Motion planners are essential for the safe operation of automated vehicles across various scenarios. However, no motion planning algorithm has achieved perfection in the literature, and improving its performance is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we present DrPlanner, the first framework designed to automatically diagnose and repair motion planners using large language models. Initially, we generate a structured description of the planner and its planned trajectories from both natural and programming languages. Leveraging the profound capabilities of large language models in addressing reasoning challenges, our framework returns repaired planners with detailed diagnostic descriptions. Furthermore, the framework advances iteratively with continuous feedback from the evaluation of the repaired outcomes. Our approach is validated using both search- and sampling-based motion planners for automated vehicles; experimental results highlight the need for demonstrations in the prompt and show the ability of our framework to effectively identify and rectify elusive issues.

### [MGS-SLAM: Monocular Sparse Tracking and Gaussian Mapping with Depth Smooth Regularization]()

This letter introduces a novel framework for dense Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) based on Gaussian Splatting. Recently, SLAM based on Gaussian Splatting has shown promising results. However, in monocular scenarios, the Gaussian maps reconstructed lack geometric accuracy and exhibit weaker tracking capability. To address these limitations, we jointly optimize sparse visual odometry tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation for the first time. Estimating depth maps on visual odometry keyframes window using a fast Multi-View Stereo (MVS) network for the geometric supervision of Gaussian maps. Furthermore, we propose a depth smooth loss and Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (SDAR) to reduce the negative effect of estimated depth maps and preserve the consistency in scale between the visual odometry and Gaussian maps. We have evaluated our system across various synthetic and real-world datasets. The accuracy of our poses estimation surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art. Additionally, it outperforms previous monocular methods in terms of novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction fidelities.

### [GARAD-SLAM: 3D GAussian Splatting for Real-Time Anti Dynamic SLAM]()

The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM system has garnered widespread attention due to its excellent performance in real-time high-fidelity rendering. However, in real-world environments filled with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address this, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians updated through the network to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.

### [Optimizing NeRF-Based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints]()

The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.

### [MGSO: Monocular Real-Time Photometric SLAM with Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting]()

Real-time SLAM with dense 3D mapping is computationally challenging, especially on resource-limited devices. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.

### [RGB-Only Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Unbounded Outdoor Scenes]()

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM, as it can produce high-fidelity novel views. However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes—OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

### [FGO-SLAM: Enhancing Gaussian SLAM with Globally Consistent Opacity Radiance Field]()

Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perception capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional SLAM systems struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our system. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

### [Multi-View Registration of Partially Overlapping Point Clouds for Robotic Manipulation]()

Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in intelligent robots, aiming to achieve globally consistent geometric structures and providing data support for robotic manipulation. Due to the limited view of measurement devices, it is necessary to collect point clouds from multiple views to construct a complete model. Previous multi-view registration methods rely on sufficient overlap and registering all pairs of point clouds, resulting in slow convergence and high cumulative errors. To solve these challenges, we present a multi-view registration method based on the point-to-plane model and pose graph. We introduce a robust kernel into the objective function to diminish registration errors caused by mismatched points. Additionally, an enhanced Euclidean clustering method is proposed for extracting object point clouds. Subsequently, by establishing pose constraints on non-adjacent frames of point clouds, the cumulative error is reduced, achieving global optimization based on the pose graph. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to overlap ratios, successfully registering point clouds with overlap ratio exceeding 30%. In comparison to other techniques, our method can reduce the E(R) of multi-view registration by 13.54% and E(t) by 18.72%, effectively reducing the cumulative error.

### [Kinematic-ICP: Enhancing LiDAR Odometry with Kinematic Constraints for Wheeled Mobile Robots Moving on Planar Surfaces]()

LiDAR odometry is essential for many robotics applications, including 3D mapping, navigation, and simultaneous localization and mapping. LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.

### [GERA: Geometric Embedding for Efficient Point Registration Analysis]()

Point cloud registration aims to provide estimated transformations to align 3D point clouds, which plays a crucial role in pose estimation of various navigation systems, such as surgical guidance systems and autonomous vehicles. Despite the impressive performance of recent models on benchmark datasets, many rely on complex modules like KPConv and Transformers, which impose significant computational and memory demands. These requirements hinder their practical application, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile robotics. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud registration network that leverages a pure MLP architecture, constructing geometric information offline. This approach eliminates the computational and memory burdens associated with traditional complex feature extractors and significantly reduces training time and resource consumption. Our method is the first to replace 3D coordinate inputs with offline-constructed geometric encoding, improving generalization and stability, as demonstrated by Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) comparisons. This efficient and accurate geometric representation marks a significant advancement in point cloud analysis, particularly for applications requiring fast and reliable processing.

### [KISS-Matcher: Fast and Robust Point Cloud Registration Revisited]()

While global point cloud registration systems have advanced significantly in all aspects, many studies have focused on specific components, such as feature extraction, graph-theoretic pruning, or pose solvers. In this paper, we take a holistic view on the registration problem and develop an open-source and versatile C++ library for point cloud registration, called textit{KISS-Matcher}. textit{KISS-Matcher} combines a novel feature detector, textit{Faster-PFH}, that improves over the classical fast point feature histogram (FPFH). Moreover, it adopts a k-core-based graph-theoretic pruning to reduce the time complexity of rejecting outlier correspondences. Finally, it combines these modules in a complete, user-friendly, and ready-to-use pipeline. As verified by extensive experiments, KISS-Matcher has superior scalability and broad applicability, achieving a substantial speed-up compared to state-of-the-art outlier-robust registration pipelines while preserving accuracy. Our code will be available at href{https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher}{texttt{ht tps://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher}}.

### [SANDRO: A Robust Solver with a Splitting Strategy for Point Cloud Registration]()

Point cloud registration is a critical problem in computer vision and robotics, especially in the field of navigation. Current methods often fail when faced with high outlier rates or take a long time to converge to a suitable solution. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for point cloud registration called SANDRO (Splitting strategy for point cloud Alignment using Non-convex anD Robust Optimization), which combines an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) framework with a robust loss function with graduated non-convexity. This approach is further enhanced by a splitting strategy designed to handle high outlier rates and skewed distributions of outliers. SANDRO is capable of addressing important limitations of existing methods, as in challenging scenarios where the presence of high outlier rates and point cloud symmetries significantly hinder convergence. SANDRO achieves superior performance in terms of success rate when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a 20% improvement from the current state of the art when tested on the Redwood real dataset and 60% improvement when tested on synthetic data.

### [Bridging In-Situ and Satellite Data: Enhancing Gas Concentration Estimation through Integration of Data-Driven and Physics-Based Modeling]()

Gas concentration estimation is crucial for understanding and mitigating climate change. While most research and monitoring efforts focus on major greenhouse gases such as CO2, significantly less attention has been given to trace gases like NO2, which play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and air quality. This paper aims to enhance trace gas concentration estimation by integrating physics-based models into data-driven neural network frameworks. Furthermore, to improve large-scale estimation accuracy, we incorporate in-situ measurements to refine neural network models trained on satellite observations. The resulting model can provide reliable large-scale gas concentration estimates, particularly for locations lacking precise in-situ measurements. This approach offers a novel pathway to enhance the accuracy and applicability of gas monitoring for climate and environmental research. While NO2 serves as the target trace gas in this study, the proposed framework is potentially applicable to the prediction of other atmospheric gas concentrations.

### [A Novel Decomposed Feature-Oriented Framework for Open-Set Semantic Segmentation on LiDAR Data]()

Semantic segmentation is a key technique that enables mobile robots to understand and navigate surrounding environments autonomously. However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/DOSS.

### [SAM-Guided Pseudo Label Enhancement for Multi-Modal 3D Semantic Segmentation]()

Multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation is vital for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR). To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.

### [Robot Manipulation in Salient Vision through Referring Image Segmentation and Geometric Constraints]()

In this paper, we perform robot manipulation activities in real-world environments with language contexts by integrating a compact referring image segmentation model into the robot's perception module. First, we propose CLIPU^2Net, a lightweight referring image segmentation model designed for fine-grain boundary and structure segmentation from language expressions. Then, we deploy the model in an eye-in-hand visual servoing system to enact robot control in the real world. The key to our system is the representation of salient visual information as geometric constraints, linking the robot’s visual perception to actionable commands. Experimental results on 46 real-world robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional visual servoing methods relying on labor-intensive feature annotations, excels in fine-grain referring image segmentation with a compact decoder size of 6.6 MB, and supports robot control across diverse contexts.

### [Boosting Cross-Spectral Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Thermal Semantic Segmentation]()

In autonomous driving, thermal image semantic segmentation has emerged as a critical research area, owing to its ability to provide robust scene understanding under adverse visual conditions. In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

### [VideoSAM: Open-World Video Segmentation]()

Video segmentation is essential for advancing robotics and autonomous driving, particularly in open-world settings where continuous perception and object association across video frames are critical. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has excelled in static image segmentation, extending its capabilities to video segmentation poses significant challenges. We tackle two major hurdles: a) SAM’s embedding limitations in associating objects across frames, and b) granularity inconsistencies in object segmentation. To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking. Additionally, we incorporate an autoregressive object-token mechanism within the SAM decoder to maintain consistent granularity across frames. Our experiments on the UVO and BURST benchmark, and also robotic videos, demonstrate VideoSAM’s effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. All codes will be available.

### [Monocular Depth Estimation and Segmentation for Transparent Object with Iterative Semantic and Geometric Fusion]()

Transparent object perception is indispensable for numerous robotic tasks. However, accurately segmenting and estimating the depth of transparent objects remain challenging due to complex optical properties. Existing methods primarily delve into only one task using extra inputs or specialized sensors, neglecting the valuable interactions among tasks and the subsequent refinement process, leading to suboptimal and blurry predictions. To address these issues, we propose a monocular framework, which is the first to excel in both segmentation and depth estimation of transparent objects, with only a single-image input. Specifically, we devise a novel semantic and geometric fusion module, effectively integrating the multi-scale information between tasks. In addition, drawing inspiration from human perception of objects, we further incorporate an iterative strategy, which progressively refines initial features for clearer results. Experiments on two challenging synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art monocular, stereo, and multi-view methods by a large margin of about 38.8%-46.2% with only a single RGB input. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/L-J-Yuan/MODEST.

### [Obstacle-Aided Trajectory Control of a Quadrupedal Robot through Sequential Gait Composition]()

Modeling and controlling legged robot locomotion on terrains with densely distributed large rocks and boulders are fundamentally challenging. Unlike traditional methods which often consider these rocks and boulders as obstacles and attempt to find a clear path to circumvent them, in this study we aim to develop methods for robots to actively utilize interaction forces with these "obstacles" for locomotion and navigation. To do so, we studied the locomotion of a quadrupedal robot as it traversed a simplified obstacle field, and discovered that with different gaits, the robot could passively converge to distinct orientations. A compositional return map explained this observed passive convergence, and enabled theoretical prediction of the steady-state orientation angles for any given quadrupedal gait. We experimentally demonstrated that with these predictions, a legged robot could effectively generate desired shape of trajectories amongst large, slippery obstacles, simply by switching between different gaits. Our study offered a novel method for robots to exploit traditionally-considered "obstacles" to achieve agile movements on challenging terrains.

### [Enhancing Navigation Efficiency of Quadruped Robots Via Leveraging Personal Transportation Platforms]()

Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (RL-ATR), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The RL-ATR features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the RL-ATR. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.

### [Continuous Control of Diverse Skills in Quadruped Robots without Complete Expert Datasets]()

Learning diverse skills for quadruped robots presents significant challenges, such as mastering complex transitions between different skills and handling tasks of varying difficulty. Existing imitation learning methods, while successful, rely on expensive datasets to reproduce expert behaviors. Inspired by introspective learning, we propose Progressive Adversarial Self-Imitation Skill Transition (PASIST), a novel method that eliminates the need for complete expert datasets. PASIST autonomously explores and selects high-quality trajectories based on predefined target poses instead of demonstrations, leveraging the Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL) framework. To further enhance learning, We develop a skill selection module to mitigate mode collapse by balancing the weights of skills with varying levels of difficulty. Through these methods, PASIST is able to reproduce skills corresponding to the target pose while achieving smooth and natural transitions between them. Evaluations on both simulation platforms and the Solo 8 robot confirm the effectiveness of PASIST, offering an efficient alternative to expert-driven learning.

### [PIP-Loco: A Proprioceptive Infinite Horizon Planning Framework for Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion]()

A core strength of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for quadrupedal locomotion has been its ability to enforce constraints and provide interpretability of the sequence of commands over the horizon. However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise. Finally, we evaluate our approach across multi-terrain scenarios in both simulation and hardware.

### [Whole-Body End-Effector Pose Tracking]()

Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system’s complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm’s workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot’s initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot’s operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64◦, outperforming existing competitive baselines.

### [MoRE : Unlocking Scalability in Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Vision-Language-Action Models]()

Developing versatile quadruped robots that can smoothly perform various actions and tasks in real-world environments remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model, mixture of robotic experts (MoRE), for quadruped robots that aim to introduce reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning large-scale VLA models with a large amount of mixed-quality data. method~integrates multiple low-rank adaptation modules as distinct experts within a dense multi-modal large language model (MLLM), forming a sparse-activated mixture of experts model. This design enables the model to effectively adapt to a wide array of downstream tasks. Moreover, we employ a reinforcement learning-based training objective to train our model as a Q-function after deeply exploring the structural properties of our tasks. Effective learning from automatically collected mixed-quality data enhances data efficiency and model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that method~outperforms all baselines across six different skills and exhibits superior generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios. We further validate our method in real-world scenarios, confirming the practicality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for future research on multi-task learning in quadruped robots.

### [From Seeing to Recognising -- an Extended Self-Organizing Map for Human Postures Identification]()

The article presents a dedicated method for recognizing human postures using classification and clustering options. The ultimate goal of the research is to recognise human actions based on posture sequences. Such a task imposes expectations on the developed method. For this purpose, a Sparse Autoencoder combined with a Self-Organized Map (SOM) is proposed. SOM is equipped with an additional layer of post-labeling or clustering. This entire structure is called the extended SOM. Two task-oriented modifications are applied to improve SOM performance -- a dedicated angular distance measure and a neighbourhood function for updating the SOM weights. The research contribution is the concept of extended SOM, which is trained using unlabeled data and classifies or clusters the human postures. The Sparse Autoencoder preserves the characteristics of the data while reducing its dimensionality. Better classification efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated compared to other representative methods. Ablation studies illustrate how the introduced modifications improve classification results. The developed method is characterised by good resolution in distinguishing postures. A discussion of the concept's usefulness is provided at the end of the article.

### [MmDEAR: MmWave Point Cloud Density Enhancement for Accurate Human Body Reconstruction]()

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers robust sensing capabilities in diverse environments, making it a highly promising solution for human body reconstruction due to its privacy-friendly and non-intrusive nature. However, the significant sparsity of mmWave point clouds limits the estimation accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that enhances mmWave point clouds and improves human body reconstruction accuracy. Our method includes a mmWave point cloud enhancement module that densifies the raw data by leveraging temporal features and a multi-stage completion network, followed by a 2D-3D fusion module that extracts both 2D and 3D motion features to refine SMPL parameters. The mmWave point cloud enhancement module learns the detailed shape and posture information from 2D human masks in single-view images. However, image-based supervision is involved only during the training phase, and the inference relies solely on sparse point clouds to maintain privacy. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with the enhanced point clouds further improving performance when integrated into existing models.

### [Human Activity Recognition by Using Enhanced Radar Point Cloud 2D Histograms and Doppler Feature Fusion]()

Human activity recognition (HAR) based on millimeter wave (mmWave) radar has recently attracted significant interest due to its diverse applications in intelligent robots and human-computer interaction (HCI), including the healthcare monitoring robot. 2-dimensional (2D) histogram features of radar point clouds have demonstrated high accuracy in HAR. But further expansion and refinement of this technique is needed. This paper presents a new precise non-invasive HAR framework based on radar point cloud 2D histograms. Our method enhances conventional 2D histograms by integrating fixed radar sensing boundaries into the histograms, which shows the relative spatial position changes of the target points detected by radar. Additionally, we have concatenated Doppler features (i.e., range-Doppler and angle-Doppler histograms) with the point cloud histograms, resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation than conventional point cloud histograms. We investigated the overfitting issue in stacked hybrid networks and established a multi-layer hybrid network with an optimal number of stacked layers for HAR. In the evaluation, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with 99.72% on mmWaveRadarWalking dataset and 98.67% on CI4R-Human-Activity-Recognition dataset, respectively. The proposed method can be applied in the fields of robotics and HCI.

### [Estimating User Engagement in Human Robot Interaction Using a Dynamic Bayesian Network]()

Engagement is a key concept in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), as high engagement often leads to improved user experience and task performance. However, accurately estimating engagement during interactions is challenging. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to infer user engagement from various modalities, including head rotation, eye movements, facial expressions captured through visual sensors, as well as facial temperature variations measured by a thermal camera. Data was gathered from a human-robot interaction (HRI) experiment, where a robot guided participants and encouraged them to share their thoughts and insights on environmental issues. Our approach successfully combines these diverse features to offer a thorough assessment of user engagement. The network was tested on its capacity to classify participants as either engaged or not engaged, achieving an accuracy of 0.83 and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.82. These findings underscore the strength of our DBN in detecting user engagement during interactions.

### [HRI-Free: Cognitive Robotic Simulation for Evaluating Embodied Social Attention Models]()

Scaling social robot studies is constrained due to the need for human interaction, making large participant recruitment impractical. Robotics simulators help mitigate this limitation but generally lack the realism to accurately simulate social cues. We introduce a cognitive robotic simulation scheme to evaluate social attention models in physical environments. By projecting ground-truth priority maps to a simulated environment, we can directly compare predicted maps using common saliency metrics. Using the iCub robot, we assess a dynamic scanpath model that predicts attention targets, simulating human scanpaths. Evaluations with the FindWho and MVVA datasets show strong correlations between robot-captured metrics and direct-streamed video metrics. Our results indicate robustness of the social attention model to noise and real-world conditions, suggesting its practical usability for predicting personalized scanpaths in real settings. This approach reduces the need for extensive human-robot interaction studies in the early stages of study design, enabling the scalability and reproducibility of social robot evaluations.

### [An EEG Conformer Model for Error Feedback During Human-Robot Interaction]()

Identifying a brain signal that enables the detection of incorrect execution in human-robot interaction (HRI) is considered a holy grail for real-time systems. A major challenge in achieving this is the inherent imbalance caused by the sparsity of error-related potential (ErrP) events in streaming electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which often leads models to learn irrelevant features and perform poorly. Thus, while Deep learning-based ErrP detection has seen considerable advancements, the variability in individual user reaction times introduces labelling errors, complicating model adaptation to new subjects. Moreover, most deep learning methods are developed and validated on discrete, offline experiments using pre-defined windows, which fail to translate effectively to continuous, real-time HRI. Addressing these challenges is crucial to improving the robustness and adaptability of real-time ErrP detection in practical HRI applications. Here, we develop a causal EEG conformer framework, combining a Convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a transformer with causal attention for real-time prediction of ErrP signals during HRI. We evaluated our ErrP model in a pseudo-online environment in both inter-session and inter-subject cross-validation settings for exoskeleton assistive robotics. Our model demonstrated superior performance in decoding accuracy and efficiency, showcasing better generalization for real-world dynamic HRI applications.

### [Cross-Platform Learning-Based Fault Tolerant Surfacing Controller for Underwater Robots]()

In this paper, we propose a novel cross-platform fault-tolerant surfacing controller for underwater robots, based on reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike conventional approaches, which require explicit identification of malfunctioning actuators, our method allows the robot to surface using only the remaining operational actuators without needing to pinpoint the failures. The proposed controller learns a robust policy capable of handling diverse failure scenarios across different actuator configurations. Moreover, we introduce a transfer learning mechanism that shares a part of the control policy across various underwater robots with different actuators, thus improving learning efficiency and generalization across platforms. To validate our approach, we conduct simulations on three different types of underwater robots: a hovering-type AUV, a torpedo shaped AUV, and a turtle-shaped robot (U-CAT). Additionally, real-world experiments are performed, successfully transferring the learned policy from simulation to a physical U-CAT in a controlled environment. Our RL-based controller demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability and success rate compared to a baseline controller, achieving an 85.7 percent success rate in real-world tests compared to 57.1 percent with a baseline controller. This research provides a scalable and efficient solution for fault-tolerant control for diverse underwater platforms, with potential applications in real-world aquatic missions.

### [Optimizing Underwater Robot Navigation: A Study of DRL Algorithms and Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion]()

Autonomous underwater navigation faces significant challenges due to the complexity of the environment, limited localization methods, and poor visibility. This paper investigates the performance of various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms—Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)—to improve navigation capabilities of low-cost underwater robots equipped with multi-modal sensors. Advanced depth estimation models such as MiDaS and Depth Anything, combined with domain randomization techniques, are employed to enhance the system's robustness and generalization across varying underwater conditions. The proposed approach integrates real-time sensor data and historical actions to enable 3D maneuvering in simulated environments, leading to significant improvements in sensor fusion, depth perception, and obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of RL techniques with sensor fusion considerably improves mapless autonomous underwater exploration, providing a robust solution for navigating unstructured aquatic environments.

### [PUGS: Perceptual Uncertainty for Grasp Selection in Underwater Environments]()

When navigating and interacting in challenging environments where sensory information is imperfect and incomplete, robots must make decisions that account for these shortcomings. We propose a novel method for quantifying and representing such perceptual uncertainty in 3D reconstruction through occupancy uncertainty estimation. We develop a framework to incorporate it into grasp selection for autonomous manipulation in underwater environments. Instead of treating each measurement equally when deciding which location to grasp from, we present a framework that propagates uncertainty inherent in the multi-view reconstruction process into the grasp selection. We evaluate our method with both simulated and the real world data, showing that by accounting for uncertainty, the grasp selection becomes robust against partial and noisy measurements. Code will be made available at https://onurbagoren.github.io/PUGS/

### [Learning to Swim: Reinforcement Learning for 6-DOF Control of Thruster-Driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles]()

Controlling AUVs can be challenging because of the effect of complex non-linear hydrodynamic forces acting on the robot, which are significant in water and cannot be ignored. The problem is exacerbated for small AUVs for which the dynamics can change significantly with payload changes and deployments under different hydrodynamic conditions. The common approach to AUV control is a combination of passive stabilization with added buoyancy on top and weights on the bottom, and a PID controller tuned for simple and smooth motion primitives. However, the approach comes at the cost of sluggish controls and often the need to re-tune controllers with configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a fast (trainable in minutes), reinforcement learning-based approach for full 6 degree of freedom (DOF) control of a thruster-driven AUVs, taking 6-DOF command-conditioned inputs direct to thruster outputs. We present a new, highly parallelized simulator for underwater vehicle dynamics. We demonstrate this approach through zero-shot sim-to-real (with no tuning) transfer onto a real AUV that produces comparable results to hand-tuned PID controllers. Furthermore, we show that domain randomization on the simulator produces policies that are robust to small variations in vehicle's physical parameters.

### [Underwater Motions Analysis and Control of a Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle]()

Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.

### [Learning Local Urban Wind Flow Fields from Range Sensing]()

Obtaining accurate and timely predictions of the wind through an urban environment is a challenging task, but has wide-ranging implications for the safety and efficiency of autonomous aerial vehicles in future urban airspaces. Prior work relies strongly on global information about the environment, such as a precise map of the city and in-situ wind measurements at various locations, to run expensive computational fluid dynamics solvers to predict the entire wind flow field. In contrast, this paper introduces a new method to estimate the wind flow field in a region around the robot in real time, utilizing on-board range measurements to sense nearby buildings and sparse wind measurements to infer windspeed and direction. We propose that this information sufficiently characterizes the structure of the wind flow field in the local region of interest. To that end, we introduce a deep learning-based approach to predict local flow fields from range measurements. Our results indicate that a neural network trained on numerous simulated winds through small randomized maps is capable of reconstructing local wind flows while generalizing to larger environments with over 200 buildings. This contribution empowers computationally-constrained aerial robots to reason about the structure of local wind flow fields, thereby enabling new planning, control, and estimation strategies in windy urban environments without textit{a priori} knowledge of the map.

### [Whole-Body Control through Narrow Gaps from Pixels to Action]()

Flying through body-size narrow gaps in the environment is one of the most challenging moments for an underactuated multirotor. We explore a purely data-driven method to master this flight skill in simulation, where a neural network directly maps pixels and proprioception to continuous low-level control commands. This learned policy enables whole-body control through gaps with different geometries demanding sharp attitude changes (e.g., near-vertical roll angle). The policy is achieved by successive model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and online observation space distillation. The RL policy receives (virtual) point clouds of the gaps' edges for scalable simulation and is then distilled into the high-dimensional pixel space. However, this flight skill is fundamentally expensive to learn by exploring in RL due to restricted feasible solution space. We propose to reset the agent as states on the trajectories by a model-based trajectory optimizer to alleviate this problem. The presented training pipeline is compared with baseline methods, and ablation studies are conducted to identify the key ingredients of the method. The immediate next step is to scale up the variation of gap sizes and geometries in anticipation of emergent policies and demonstrate the sim-to-real transformation.

### [Environment As Policy: Learning to Race in Unseen Tracks]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved outstanding success in complex robot control tasks, such as drone racing, where the RL agents have outperformed human champions in a known racing track. However, these agents fail in unseen track configurations, always requiring complete retraining when presented with new track layouts. This work aims to develop RL agents that generalize effectively to novel track configurations without retraining. The naive solution of training directly on a diverse set of track layouts can overburden the agent, resulting in suboptimal policy learning as the increased complexity of the environment impairs the agent’s ability to learn to fly. To enhance the generalizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping framework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the agent’s performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to design environments that strike a balance between being challenging and achievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively. Using our adaptive environment shaping, one single racing policy efficiently learns to race in diverse and challenging tracks. Experimental results validated in both simulation and the real world show that our method enables drones to successfully fly complex and unseen race tracks, outperforming existing environment-shaping techniques.

### [UAV-Assisted Self-Supervised Terrain Awareness for Off-Road Navigation]()

Terrain awareness is an essential milestone to enable truly autonomous off-road navigation. Accurately predicting terrain characteristics allows optimizing a vehicle's path against potential hazards. Recent methods use deep neural networks to predict traversability-related terrain properties in a self-supervised manner, relying on proprioception as a training signal. However, onboard cameras are inherently limited by their point-of-view relative to the ground, suffering from occlusions and vanishing pixel density with distance. This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised terrain characterization using an aerial perspective from a hovering drone. We capture terrain-aligned images while sampling the environment with a ground vehicle, effectively training a simple predictor for vibrations, bumpiness, and energy consumption. Our dataset includes 2.8 km of off-road data collected in forest environment, comprising 13 484 ground-based images and 12 935 aerial images. Our findings show that drone imagery improves terrain property prediction by 21.37 % on the whole dataset and 37.35 % in high vegetation, compared to ground images. We conduct ablation studies to identify the main causes of these performance improvements. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach by scouting an unseen area with a drone, planning and executing an optimized path on the ground.

### [EdgeFlowNet: 100FPS@1W Dense Optical Flow for Tiny Mobile Robots]()

Optical flow estimation is a critical task for tiny mobile robotics to enable safe and accurate navigation, obstacle avoidance, and other functionalities. However, optical flow estimation on tiny robots is challenging due to limited onboard sensing and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose EdgeFlowNet, a high-speed, low-latency dense optical flow approach for tiny autonomous mobile robots by harnessing the power of edge computing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by deploying EdgeFlowNet on a tiny quadrotor to perform static obstacle avoidance, flight through unknown gaps and dynamic obstacle dodging. EdgeFlowNet is about 20X faster than the previous state-of-the-art approaches while improving accuracy by over 20% and using only 1.08W of power enabling advanced autonomy on palm-sized tiny mobile robots.

### [GMF: Gravitational Mass-Force Framework for Parametric Multi-Level Coordination in Multi-Robot and Swarm Robotic Systems]()

Distributed multi-robot coordination is critical to achieving reliable robotic missions that exploit the collective capability of swarm robots. In particular, the consensus and formation control problems have been extensively studied, resulting in distributed controllers that enable robots to rely only on information from themselves and their immediate neighbors. However, these algorithms are usually designed for specific objectives (e.g., cooperative object transportation, environmental coverage, etc.), requiring the controllers to be re-designed for domain variations. Therefore, we propose a new parametric framework inspired by gravitational fields that allow simultaneous coordination of robots at multiple levels, enabling generalization and domain adaptation. Our approach is built on top of a connectivity-preserving formation controller, with need-based and task-based ad hoc coordination at private, local, and global layers of a swarm robot team. We demonstrate the remarkable potential of our framework through extensive simulations and real-world swarm robot experiments in three representative multi-robot tasks involving tight coordination: 1) robot-initiated rendezvous at different coordination layers, 2) coordinated boundary tracking and coverage of environmental processes, and 3) accommodating task executions and motion control while satisfying the coordination laws.

### [Leader-Follower Formation Control of Perturbed Nonholonomic Agents Along Parametric Curves with Directed Communication]()

In this letter, we propose a novel formation controller for nonholonomic agents to form general parametric curves. First, we derive a unified parametric representation for both open and closed curves. Then, a leader-follower formation controller is designed to drive agents to form the desired parametric curves using the curve coefficients as feedbacks. We consider directed communications and constant input disturbances rejection in the controller design. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves the asymptotic stability of the proposed controller. The convergence of the orientations of agents to some constant values is also guaranteed. The method has the potential to be extended to deal with various real-world applications, such as object enclosing. Detailed numerical simulations and experimental studies are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method.

### [Versatile Distributed Maneuvering with Generalized Formations Using Guiding Vector Fields]()

This paper presents a unified approach to realize versatile distributed maneuvering with generalized formations. Specifically, we decompose the robots' maneuvers into two independent components, i.e., interception and enclosing, which are parameterized by two independent virtual coordinates. Treating these two virtual coordinates as dimensions of an abstract manifold, we derive the corresponding singularity-free guiding vector field (GVF), which, along with a distributed coordination mechanism based on the consensus theory, guides robots to achieve various motions (i.e., versatile maneuvering), including (a) formation tracking, (b) target enclosing, and (c) circumnavigation. Additional motion parameters can generate more complex cooperative robot motions. Based on GVFs, we design a controller for a nonholonomic robot model. Besides the theoretical results, extensive simulations and experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

This paper presents experiments for embedded cooperative distributed model predictive control applied to a team of hovercraft floating on an air hockey table. The hovercraft collectively solve a centralized optimal control problem in each sampling step via a stabilizing decentralized real-time iteration scheme using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The efficient implementation does not require a central coordinator, executes onboard the hovercraft, and facilitates sampling intervals in the millisecond range. The formation control experiments showcase the flexibility of the approach on scenarios with point-to-point transitions, trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and moving obstacles.

### [Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation with Formation Adaptation]()

Coordinated multi-robot navigation is an essential ability for a team of robots operating in diverse environments. Robot teams often need to maintain specific formations, such as wedge formations, to enhance visibility, positioning, and efficiency during fast movement. However, complex environments such as narrow corridors challenge rigid team formations, which makes effective formation control difficult in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Adaptive Formation with Oscillation Reduction (AFOR) approach to improve coordinated multi-robot navigation. We develop AFOR under the theoretical framework of hierarchical learning and integrate a spring-damper model with hierarchical learning to enable both team coordination and individual robot control. At the upper level, a graph neural network facilitates formation adaptation and information sharing among the robots. At the lower level, reinforcement learning enables each robot to navigate and avoid obstacles while maintaining the formations. We conducted extensive experiments using Gazebo in the Robot Operating System (ROS), a high-fidelity Unity3D simulator with ROS, and real robot teams. Results demonstrate that AFOR enables smooth navigation with formation adaptation in complex scenarios and outperforms previous methods. More details of this work are provided on the project website: https://hcrlab.gitlab.io/project/afor.

### [MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Constrained Field-Of-View Multi-Robot Exploration in Large-Scale Environments]()

In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL’s learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL’s generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.

### [RACE: A Fast and Lightweight Urban Exploration and Search Strategy for Multi-Robot Systems]()

Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) are increasingly deployed for hazardous tasks in urban environments. Among many tasks, search and rescue remains challenging as it deals with exploration in an unknown indoor constrained environment. For example, without global knowledge of the map of a building floor, it is not advantageous to choose one path over another at a corridor junction. Also, if the assigned frontiers are far from the robot, backtracking along a corridor will cost more than moving forward. Since exploration along corridors is similar to solving a maze, this paper examines classical maze-solving algorithms that are known to be computationally fast and lightweight, such as the Right Hand Rule (RHR), Random Mouse (RM), and more. The authors have identified two gaps that need to be addressed before these algorithms can be applied to physical MRS. Firstly, these algorithms are not designed for the cooperation of multiple agents in exploration. Secondly, they are often applied to only a low-fidelity simulation environment, which requires some work to make these algorithms transferable to work in the commonly used occupancy grid map environment. In this paper, the authors introduced RACE, a fast and lightweight collective urban exploration and search algorithm based on a modified and condensed version of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed solution is successfully verified in a low-fidelity simulation, evaluated against other exploration and search algorithms like RHR and RM. An innovative approach of RACE Simulation to Physical implementation is presented and a physical system evaluation is performed to evaluate RACE against a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree algorithm. Finally, the proposed solution is further verified with a physical experiment, which a quadrupedal robot is assigned to explore part of a floor of SUTD, spanning approximately (55m x 40m). RACE also showed potential in handling challenging close-loop and dead-end environments.

### [Reinforcement Learning Driven Multi-Robot Exploration Via Explicit Communication and Density-Based Frontier Search]()

Collaborative multi-agent exploration of unknown environments is crucial for search and rescue operations. Effective real-world deployment must address challenges such as limited inter-agent communication and static and dynamic obstacles. This paper introduces a novel decentralized collaborative framework based on Reinforcement Learning to enhance multi-agent exploration in unknown environments. Our approach enables agents to decide their next action using an agent-centered field-of-view occupancy grid, and features extracted from A* algorithm-based trajectories to frontiers in the reconstructed global map. Furthermore, we propose a constrained communication scheme that enables agents to share their environmental knowledge efficiently, minimizing exploration redundancy. The decentralized nature of our framework ensures that each agent operates autonomously, while contributing to a collective exploration mission. Extensive simulations in Gymnasium and real-world experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system, while all the results highlight the benefits of combining autonomous exploration with inter-agent map sharing, advancing the development of scalable and resilient robotic exploration systems.

### [Integrating Multi-Robot Adaptive Sampling and Informative Path Planning for Spatiotemporal Natural Environment Prediction]()

Learning to predict spatiotemporal (ST) environmental processes from a sparse set of samples collected autonomously is a difficult task from both a sampling perspective (collecting the best sparse samples) and from a learning perspective (predicting the next timestep). In this work, we focus on investigating the sample collection process via multi-robot informative path planning. We present an approach for incorporating multi-robot informative path planning into a spatiotemporal adaptive sampling framework while considering path length constraints for sampling location selection. We also incorporate informative path planning to determine the best path to collect samples along while en route to collecting the desired sample. We achieve this in a decentralized manner by decoupling the process into two stages: the first stage uses our spatiotemporal mixture of Gaussian Processes (STMGP) model to determine the most informative sampling location via a mutual information lower bound heuristic and the second stage plans an informative path to collect the desired sample and other additional informative samples via submodular function optimization. Moreover, we effectively leverage peer-to-peer communication to enable coordination. Simulation results on real-world spatiotemporal data are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

### [D-PBS: Dueling Priority-Based Search for Multiple Nonholonomic Robots Motion Planning in Congested Environments]()

This letter focuses on the multiple nonholonomic robots motion planning (MRMP) problem in congested and complex environments, where the complexity escalates dramatically with the increase in the number of robots, frequently leading to deadlocks. We present the Dueling Priority-Based Search (D-PBS), an efficient and scalable priority-based motion planner for multiple nonholonomic car-like robots, capable of enabling robots to move safely to destinations in spatially-constrained settings. We achieve this by adopting the alternate dueling collision resolution approach, coupled with the exploration of comprehensive priority relationships, effectively addressing the deadlock situations. We also introduce a novel priority-binding algorithm to enhance the scalability of our planner in restricted spaces densely populated with robots. Experimental evaluations in various scenarios demonstrate that D-PBS outperforms standard approaches to MRMP, offering superior path quality and scalability for larger robot swarms.

### [Vision-Based Haptic Rendering with Self-Occlusion Resilience Using Shadow Correspondence]()

Vision-based haptic feedback provides cost-effective preemptive protection and real-time guidance, enhancing teleoperation with reduced system complexity. However, challenges arise as the instrument approaches target object, leading to occlusion of the point cloud behind the remote instrument, known as the self-occlusion issue. Prior solutions relying on historical point clouds or multiple viewpoints to refill the occluded region encounter adaptability issues for prolonged occlusion and limited space, thus hindering practical implementation. This paper introduces a novel non-refilling-based method for haptic force rendering, leveraging the correspondence between the tool-tip position and the tip position of the shadow-like occluded region. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's resilience across self-occlusion and dynamic environments, highlighting its practical applicability in robotic teleoperation.

### [A New Expression for the Passivity Bound for a Class of Sampled-Data Systems]()

In this article, we characterize the passivity of a class of haptic systems modeled as a simple sampled-data system. Passivity is guaranteed by ensuring that there is enough damping in the haptic interface. A necessary and sufficient bound was determined in earlier work, but the corresponding mathematical expressions were complicated, and the derivations were not completely rigorous. In this article, a more tractable expression is derived. Based on the improved expression, passivity conditions are obtained for several classes of transfer functions representing virtual environments.

### [A Haptic Feedback Device Actuated by Electromagnetic Torque]()

Haptic feedback enhances user interaction with systems by adding the sense of touch, thereby improving immersion and realism in applications like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), video games, education, and robotic surgery. To address the challenges in mechanically actuated haptic feedback devices such as limited mobility, mechanical wear, and complex mechanical structures, several research sought to develop electromagnetic haptic feedback systems. However, they also suffer from the rapid decay of magnetic force with distance, thus restricting their workspace size and application potential. In this paper, we propose a novel electromagnetic haptic feedback device that is actuated by magnetic torque instead of magnetic force. By controlling the magnetic torque, which decays with distance only at a third-order rate, our device achieves a large workspace—a 200-mm-diameter hemisphere—while still delivering perceptible real-time haptic feedback within the hemisphere. While using the device, the user wears a lightweight haptic thimble housing a permanent magnet on their finger, which enables 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) haptic feedback. A 13-coil electromagnet array serves as the source of the magnetic field. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the currents in the electromagnet array to generate the desired amount of haptic feedback torque. We conducted two experiments to prove the viability of the device. A haptic feedback accuracy experiment was conducted and validated the device's ability to generate sufficient torque within a large workspace. A user evaluation experiment showed that the device achieved an overall accuracy of 77.86% in a virtual enclosure exploration task, indicating its effectiveness and usability in haptic feedback applications.

### [Vibrotactile Haptics with Soft Magnetoresponsive Surface Interface]()

This paper explores the feasibility of using magnetoresponsive silicone as the primary mechanism for generating vibrotactile feedback in haptic interfaces. The distinctive feature of this research lies in the integration of magnetoresponsive silicone, a flexible material that responds to electromagnetic fields to produce localized vibrations. Preliminary experiments evaluate the performance of these actuators, focusing on their ability to produce controlled vibrations across a range of frequencies and amplitudes relevant to human tactile perception. Building on this foundation, we introduce the VibroFlex Pad, a haptic interface featuring a magnetoresponsive silicone sheet and an array of electromagnets. The VibroFlex Pad demonstrates its versatility in generating varied tactile effects and simulating dynamic wave-like movements across its surface. To assess the VibroFlex Pad's effectiveness, a user study was conducted, separately evaluating tactile accuracy, overall performance, and user comfort. The findings suggest that the VibroFlex Pad offers reliable and precise vibrotactile feedback, highlighting its potential to enhance wearable haptic technologies and improve the user experience in a variety of applications.

### [Haptic Shoulder for Rendering Biomechanically Accurate Joint Limits for Human-Robot Physical Interactions]()

Human-robot physical interaction (pHRI) is a rapidly evolving research field with significant implications for physical therapy, search and rescue, and telemedicine. However, a major challenge lies in accurately understanding human constraints and safety in human-robot physical experiments without an IRB and physical human experiments. Concerns regarding human studies include safety concerns, repeatability, and scalability of the number and diversity of participants. This paper examines whether a physical approximation can serve as a stand-in for human subjects to enhance robot autonomy for physical assistance. This paper introduces the SHULDRD (Shoulder Haptic Universal Limb Dynamic Repositioning Device), an economical and anatomically similar device designed for real-time testing and deployment of pHRI planning tasks onto robots in the real world. SHULDRD replicates human shoulder motion, providing crucial force feedback and safety data. The device's open-source CAD and software facilitate easy construction and use, ensuring broad accessibility for researchers. By providing a flexible platform able to emulate infinite human subjects, ensure repeatable trials, and provide quantitative metrics to assess the effectiveness of the robotic intervention, SHULDRD aims to improve the safety and efficacy of human-robot physical interactions.

### [Experimental Evaluation of Haptic Shared Control for Multiple Electromagnetic Untethered Microrobots (I)]()

The precise manipulation of microrobots presents challenges arising from their small size and susceptibility to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we present the experimental evaluation of a haptic shared control teleoperation framework for the locomotion of multiple microrobots, relying on a kinesthetic haptic interface and a custom electromagnetic system. Six combinations of haptic and shared control strategies are evaluated during a safe 3D navigation scenario in a cluttered environment. 18 participants are asked to steer two spherical magnetic microrobots among obstacles to reach a predefined goal, under different conditions. For each condition, participants are provided with different obstacle avoidance and navigation guidance cues. Results show that providing assistance in avoiding obstacles guarantees safer performance, regardless if the assistance is autonomous or delivered through a haptic repulsive force. Moreover, autonomous obstacle avoidance also reduces the completion time by 30% compared to haptic obstacle avoidance and no obstacle avoidance cases, although haptic feedback is preferred by the users. Finally, providing haptic guidance towards the target improves by the 65% the positioning accuracy of the microrobots with respect to not providing this guidance.

### [StableLego: Stability Analysis of Block Stacking Assembly]()

Structural stability is a necessary condition for successful construction of an assembly. However, designing a stable assembly requires a non-trivial effort since a slight variation in the design could significantly affect the structural stability. To address the challenge, this paper studies the stability of assembly structures, in particular, block stacking assembly. The paper proposes a new optimization formulation, which optimizes over force balancing equations, for inferring the structural stability of 3D block stacking structures. The proposed stability analysis is verified on hand-crafted Lego examples. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly predict whether the structure is stable. In addition, it outperforms the existing methods since it can accurately locate the weakest parts in the design, and more importantly, solve any given assembly structures. To further validate the proposed method, we provide StableLego: a comprehensive dataset including 50k+ 3D objects with their Lego layouts. We test the proposed stability analysis and include the stability inference for each corresponding object in StableLego. Our code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/StableLego.

### [Component Selection for Craft Assembly Tasks]()

Inspired by traditional handmade crafts, where a person improvises assemblies based on the available objects, we formally introduce the Craft Assembly Task. It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.

### [Assembly Order Planning for Modular Structures by Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems]()

Coordinated multi-agent robotic construction provides a means to build infrastructure in extreme environments and improve efficiency in high performance applications. Planning methods are key to understanding and achieving the scope of such applications, and are typically tailored to specific models of construction material and a consideration of passivity or activity thereof. Here, we focus on the NASA Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) model, which includes passive lightweight structural modules and small robots that traverse the structure. We present an algorithm for calculating a build plan for robots under the constraints of this type of system. We then evaluate the quality of this plan experimentally. Many of the techniques we use can be applied to any robotic assembly system whose robots perform locomotion over the structure that they are building.

### [Master Rules from Chaos: Learning to Reason, Plan, and Interact from Chaos for Tangram Assembly]()

Tangram assembly, the art of human intelligence and manipulation dexterity, is a new challenge for robotics and reveals the limitations of state-of-the-arts. Here, we describe our initial exploration and highlight key problems in reasoning, planning, and manipulation for robotic tangram assembly. We present MRChaos (Master Rules from Chaos), a robust and general solution for learning assembly policies that can generalize to novel objects. In contrast to conventional methods based on prior geometric and kinematic models, MRChaos learns to assemble randomly generated objects through self-exploration in simulation without prior experience in assembling target objects. The reward signal is obtained from the visual observation change without manually designed models or annotations. MRChaos retains its robustness in assembling various novel tangram objects that have never been encountered during training, with only silhouette prompts. We show the potential of MRChaos in wider applications such as cutlery combinations. The presented work indicates that radical generalization in robotic assembly can be achieved by learning in much simpler domains.

### [Robot Planning under Uncertainty for Object Assembly and Troubleshooting Using Human Causal Models]()

In this paper we explore if human mental models of objects, even when flawed, can be integrated with a collaborative robot's decision making framework to allow it to make smarter choices under partial observability for different object-related tasks such as assembly and troubleshooting. We demonstrate how (1) these informative causal models can be extracted from humans through crowdsourcing, (2) object assembly and troubleshooting can be formulated as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and (3) our extracted causal models can be incorporated into those models in the form of approximate priors. Finally, (4) we use systematic experimentation in simulation to demonstrate the success of this approach, with 2X average improvement in reward observed for object assembly tasks, and 1.4X average improvement in reward observed for troubleshooting tasks.

### [Robotic Dry-Stacking of Clocháin with Irregular Stones]()

This paper explores automated robotic construction of clocháin, a type of corbelled rock shelter, traditionally crafted by skilled workers. While robots have been employed for simple dry-stacking tasks in the past, such as construction of stone walls or vertical stone towers, the question of whether robots possess the capacity to construct more functional structures remains unanswered. This study presents a significant step forward in robotic dry-stacking of functional structures: the assembly of natural stones into freestanding clocháin structures. We also present a set of stackability measures to aid stone selection, which significantly improves the stability of the planned structures. Our sequential filtering approach, originally designed for planning stone walls, plays a foundational role in achieving stable clochán construction. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the stackability measures and demonstrate the physical execution of dry-stacking clocháin. The progress demonstrated in this paper opens the door to robotic construction of a wide range of utility structures in unstructured environments.

### [Synthesizing Depowdering Trajectories for Robot Arms Using Deep Reinforcement Learning]()

Research into robotics applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has increasingly been focussed on learning precise object manipulation and trajectory planning. Extending these tasks to continuous robot-object interactions with the surface of complex geometries remains an open problem. In this paper we investigate end-to-end DRL solutions for depowdering tasks that work by directing a pressurized air stream onto the object's surfaces using a blast nozzle head mounted on a robotic arm. We develop a GPU accelerated vectorized cleaning effect for integration into RL training and consider ways to expose vision-less trajectory synthesis for surface treatment applications to the RL agent based on UV mapping. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DRL has the potential to be used for generating object-specific agents for depowdering tasks on a variety of 3D objects without requiring intermediate path planners even in a full 3D motion setup. Finally, we show that DRL-generated trajectories can be transferred to a real-world setup. Our task formulation lends itself to approximate a wide range of surface treatment applications (e.g., cleaning and spray painting) with various effects.

### [World Model-Based Perception for Visual Legged Locomotion]()

Legged locomotion over various terrains is challenging and requires precise perception of the robot and its surroundings from both proprioception and vision. However, learning directly from high-dimensional visual input is often data-inefficient and intricate. To address this issue, traditional methods attempt to learn a teacher policy with access to privileged information first and then learn a student policy to imitate the teacher's behavior with visual input. Despite some progress, this imitation framework prevents the student policy from achieving optimal performance due to the information gap between inputs. Furthermore, the learning process is unnatural since animals intuitively learn to traverse different terrains based on their understanding of the world without privileged knowledge. Inspired by this natural ability, we propose a simple yet effective method, World Model-based Perception (WMP), which builds a world model of the environment and learns a policy based on the world model. We illustrate that though completely trained in simulation, the world model can make accurate predictions of real-world trajectories, thus providing informative signals for the policy controller. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that WMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in traversability and robustness. Videos and Code are available at: https://wmp-loco.github.io/.

### [V-Pilot: A Velocity Vector Control Agent for Fixed-Wing UAVs from Imperfect Demonstrations]()

This paper addresses the challenge of Velocity Vector Control (VVC) for fixed-wing UAVs using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the presence of imperfect demonstrations. The multi-objective and long-horizon nature of VVC introduces significant spatial and temporal complexities, complicating RL's exploration. While demonstration-based RL methods can help mitigate exploration challenges, their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the provided demonstrations. To tackle this, we propose V-Pilot, a novel approach that integrates: (1) a controller equipped with a control law model to reduce action oscillation, thus alleviating temporal exploration issues, and (2) a VVC-specific training workflow for iterative policy refinement and demonstration quality improvement. This framework is designed to enhance the performance of demonstration-based RL under imperfect demonstrations. We evaluate V-Pilot on the fixed-wing UAV RL environment, FlyCraft. Experimental results demonstrate that V-Pilot outperforms PID and Behavioral Cloning across multiple performance metrics.

### [Efficiently Generating Expressive Quadruped Behaviors Via Language-Guided Preference Learning]()

Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However, determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries, outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional preference learning approaches.

### [Learning Multi-Agent Coordination for Replenishment at Sea]()

Optimizing large-scale logistics is computationally challenging due to its scale and requirement to be robust to stochastic and time-varying weather disturbances. However, prior research in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) does not address scenarios that capture complexity of logistics operations influenced by dynamic weather patterns. To address this gap, we suggest a new MARL environment, textsc{Marine} that has two types of agents equipped with limited resources and integrates real wave data to model the influences of weather on the replenishment at sea (RAS) operation. To this end, we propose SchedHGNN, a novel MARL algorithm that incorporates a heterogeneous graph neural network and an intrinsic reward scheme to enhance agent coordination and mitigate challenges induced by environment non-stationarity. Our results show that the combination of effective RAS scheduling and improved communication enables our model to outperform competitive baselines by up to 37.8%. This achievement marks a significant advancement in applying MARL to complex, real-world logistics scenarios.

### [Real-Time Ultrasound Imaging of a Human Muscle to Optimize Shared Control in a Hybrid Exoskeleton]()

A hybrid exoskeleton is a class of wearable robotic technology that simultaneously uses a powered exoskeleton and functional electrical stimulation (FES) to generate assistive joint torques for people with impaired mobility due to neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The hybrid assistive technology benefits from FES that actively elicits force from paralyzed muscles via their neural excitation, leading to muscle strengthening. The main technical barrier to realizing the hybrid technology is to attain stable coordination between FES and the exoskeleton despite the quick onset of FES-induced muscle fatigue, which causes a rapid decline in the muscle force. Current methods to measure the induced fatigue lack direct muscle state measurements and may be ineffective at capturing the muscle force decay due to FES. Instead, ultrasound (US) imaging accurately quantifies FES-related muscle contractility and fatigue due to the direct visualization of muscle fibers. In this paper, we use real-time US imaging-derived muscle strain changes as biomarkers of FES-induced fatigue in an optimal controller that modulates exoskeleton assistance and FES dosage. To demonstrate that real-time US imaging is a promising muscle-machine interface technology that can optimize shared control in a hybrid exoskeleton, we perform experiments involving continuous seated knee extension and over-ground walking tasks on two participants with SCI and four participants without disabilities. Furthermore, this work helps design a novel and unprecedented robotic gait technology with the capability to impart FES-associated therapeutic benefits while assisting the gait of neurologically impaired individuals, including those with SCI, stroke, multiple sclerosis, etc.

### [Design and Control of a Novel Semi-Passive Knee Exoskeleton]()

This paper presents a novel semi-passive knee exoskeleton designed to provide running assistance. It incorporates an energy-efficient clutch mechanism activated by a mini servomotor which engages and disengages the spring that supports the leg during running. The exoskeleton extracts energy during the running phase when the muscles are acting as brakes (negative power), stores it in the spring, and then returns this energy during the positive power phase (when the muscles are acting as motors). The exoskeleton controller implements an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to estimate the shank orientation that determines when to engage and disengage the spring. Two experiments designed to probe the functionality of the exoskeleton were conducted to evaluate its control performance and actuation, and the exoskeleton's biomechanical impact on three subjects. The findings showed that the control mechanism could be engaged and disengaged in real time. The maximum moment created on the knee muscles was 17 Nm, although the device could supply 28 Nm. The ratio of the consumed servo energy consumption to the subjects’ saved energy was 1:160 (0.1W input to 16W saved). This study thus paves the way for the development of lightweight, inexpensive exoskeletons that can contribute to their greater availability for a broader range of individuals.

### [Model-Based Control Strategies Comparison of One Bionic Ankle Tensegrity Exoskeleton: BATE]()

This paper presents a comparative analysis of model-based control strategies for a Bionic Ankle Tensegrity Exoskeleton (BATE). The BATE is designed to mimic the self-stress equilibrium and self-supporting characteristics of the human ankle biotensegrity structure. Model-based control strategies are conventional methods that can help discover the principles of complex tensegrity systems. The high dimensions and non-linearity of the BATE pose challenges for physical modelling and require unique model-based control strategies. In this study, we propose a modelling method that considers interaction force and explore the trajectory tracking performance and robustness of the ankle exoskeleton under three power-assisted control methods: position control, force control, and hybrid force-position contorl. The experimental results suggest that the PC method offers superior tracking performance and robustness compared to the other two methods. This method can be used for early rehabilitation training to improve flexibility. The control concept emphasizes its advantages over current wearable exoskeletons and introduces new ideas for high-performance exoskeletons.

### [Human-Like Walking Motion Generation for Self-Balancing Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons]()

Self-balancing lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (SLLREs) allow individuals with lower limb dysfunction to walk without the use of crutches. Stable and human-like walking motions are crucial for SLLREs because achieving a close imitation of healthy human walking is a key goal in rehabilitation therapy. Existing SLLREs can realize stable walking but lack human-like features. This paper designs a walking motion generator based on hierarchical optimization to generate a human-like walking motion with variable hip height, heel-strike, toe-off, and knee-stretched features. This hierarchically optimized human-like walking motion generator consists of a knee-stretched optimizer and an optimization-based stabilizing filter. Specifically, the knee-stretched optimizer realizes the stretched knee feature by optimizing the hip trajectory with varying heights. And the stabilizing filter realizes stable walking by optimizing the hip trajectory in the sagittal plane direction.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed human-like walking motion generator, walking experiments were conducted on SLLRE AutoLEE-G3 both in a simulation environment and the real world. The experimental results show that the human-like walking motions look more natural and reduce the required torque for the knee joint compared with knee-bent walking.

### [Kinematic Benefits of a Cable-Driven Exosuit for Head-Neck Mobility]()

This letter presents a novel cable-driven exosuit intended for head-neck support and movement assistance. Mobility limitations in the head-neck, such as dropped head syndrome, can result from various neurological disorders. Current solutions, ranging from static neck collars to rigid-link robotic neck exoskeletons, are unsatisfactory. Neck collars are the most used clinically but fail to restore head-neck motion. Rigid-link neck exoskeletons can enable head movement but are bulky and restrictive. In this letter, we present the design of this exosuit, an analysis of its ability to balance the gravitational moment of the head in simulation, and the results of a user study comparing its kinematic performance to a state-of-the-art rigid-link neck exoskeleton. The exosuit is able to support the head across its full range of motion according to simulation results. It fits users of different sizes and participants exhibited more natural head-neck movement wearing the exosuit as compared to wearing the rigid-link exoskeleton. The exosuit allowed more head rotations than the rigid-link neck exoskeleton and required less compensatory torso movement for three daily tasks (looking for traffic, drinking from a bottle, and picking up an object from the floor). Its absolute range of motion was also much larger than the one allowed by the rigid-link neck exoskeleton. These results demonstrate the kinematic benefits of a cable-driven neck exosuit and provide justification for studying the use of such an exosuit for head-neck movement assistance in patient groups.

### [PH-Gauss-Lobatto Reduced-Order-Model for Shape Control of Soft-Continuum Manipulators]()

Soft and hyper-elastic materials possess properties of resilience and flexibility, characterizing a class of Soft-Continuum Manipulators (SCM). The latter describes a robot structure with an infinite number of degrees of freedom (DoFs), useful for mobility and manipulation. However, these geometric characteristics are source of modeling and control problems. In this paper, a Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve based Reduced-Order-Model (ROM) relying on the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature is investigated for the modeling and the control of SCM. This allows, first, reducing the dimension of the SCM kinematics based on the PH parametric curves with a predefined length and second, developing the shape kinematics control from its control polygon. The use of the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature allows to move independently the PH curve control points, while preserving PH features of length and minimum curve energy. These features are important to control in real-time the shape of the SCM. The proposed approach has been validated numerically and experimentally, carried out on a bio-inspired Soft continuum Elephant Trunk Robot.

### [Towards Contact-Aided Motion Planning for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots]()

Tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs), with their flexible backbones, offer the advantage of being used for navigating complex, cluttered environments. However, to do so, they typically require multiple segments, often leading to complex actuation and control challenges. To this end, we propose a novel approach to navigate cluttered spaces effectively for a single-segment long TDCR which is the simplest topology from a mechanical point of view. Our key insight is that by leveraging contact with the environment we can achieve multiple curvatures without mechanical alterations to the robot. Specifically, we propose a search-based motion planner for a single-segment TDCR. This planner, guided by a specially designed heuristic, discretizes the configuration space and employs a best-first search. The heuristic, crucial for efficient navigation, provides an effective cost-to-go estimation while respecting the kinematic constraints of the TDCR and environmental interactions. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of our planner-testing over 525 queries in environments with both convex and non-convex obstacles, our planner is demonstrated to have a success rate of about 80% while baselines were not able to obtain a success rate higher than 30%. The difference is attributed to our novel heuristic which is shown to significantly reduce the required search space.

### [A Simple Dynamics Model for Cable Driven Continuum Robots with Actuator Coupling]()

The flexibility and dexterity of cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) make them well-suited for intricate tasks such as minimally invasive surgery. However, the complexity of accurately modeling their dynamics has limited their broader adoption and effective control. Current models either oversimplify the dynamics by assuming quasi-static conditions or overcomplicate them, making real-time application challenging. Additionally, many existing models neglect the critical coupling between the robot's body and actuator dynamics, a factor essential for accurate control. In this paper, we propose a new, minimal dynamics model for CDCRs that strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy. Our model captures the essential dynamics of both the robot and its actuators, providing a practical tool for control design. We also establish connections between our model and those used for other robotic systems, enabling the transfer of well-established control strategies to CDCRs. The model is validated through hardware experiments, demonstrating its capability to effectively address complex control challenges in CDCR applications.

### [A Novel Tendon-Driven Articulated Continuum Robot with Stabilized Self-Locking Joints]()

Articulated continuum robots (ACRs) are characterized by flexibility, controllability, and adaptability and perform excellently in complex and constrained environments. However, the large number of motor drives limit the ACRs' portability and make them cumbersome to control. This paper presents a novel tendon-driven ACR composed of stabilized self-locking joints (SLJs) connected in series. After triggering the mechanical constraints with shape memory alloy coils, each joint can be maintained in either a self-locking or release state with zero power consumption. Consequently, even with a single set of drive units, the ACR can operate in multiple modes, enabling variable motion performance and workspace adaptability, effectively reducing the number of motors. The ACR's stiffness also varies with the locking state of its SLJs, and no motor drive is required to maintain its shape when all SLJs are self-locking. The performance and reliability of the SLJ prototype were validated. The workspace of the ACR prototype model was analyzed, and its partial motion performance, motion error, and variable stiffness were verified.

### [Tensiworm: A Novel Tensegrity Robot with Enhanced Peristaltic Locomotion Efficiency]()

Tensegrity structures have been widely explored for their lightweight, high-stiffness, and foldable properties. These unique characteristics have enabled their application in various fields including robotics. Tensegrity robots have demonstrated diverse locomotion modes offering versatile solutions for navigation in complex environments. Recent efforts in bio-inspired robotics have led to designs mimicking the movement of natural organisms, such as earthworms. However, existing designs, particularly those utilizing motor-pulley mechanisms for robot body contraction, face significant challenges due to their bulky actuation systems that reduce locomotion efficiency. This paper introduces a novel tensegrity robot, "Tensiworm," inspired by the peristaltic locomotion of an earthworm. Composed of three icosahedron tensegrity unit cells connected in series, the Tensiworm robot employs a sequential contraction and relaxation mechanism driven by active cable members made of shape memory actuators. This innovative design achieves a 59.13% folding ratio and weighs only 46.9 grams. The robot can travel a distance equal to its body length in approximately ten cycles with an average speed of 10.01 mm per minute. Furthermore, the use of thinner, flexible structural members broadens possibilities for development of millimeter-scale tensegrity robots, which hold significant potential for biomedical applications, including in-vivo testing and targeted drug delivery.

### [Accelerated Quasi-Static FEM for Real-Time Modeling of Continuum Robots with Multiple Contacts and Large Deformation]()

Continuum 机器人提供高度的灵活性和多个自由度，使其成为导航窄流腔的理想选择。然而，准确模拟它们在大变形和频繁环境接触下的行为仍然具有挑战性。当前求解这些机器人变形的方法，例如模型降阶法和高斯-塞德尔 （GS） 方法，都存在明显的缺点。随着接触点数量的增加，他们的计算速度会降低，并且难以在速度和模型精度之间取得平衡。为了克服这些限制，我们引入了一种名为 Acc-FEM 的新型有限元方法 （FEM）。Acc-FEM 采用大变形准静态有限元模型，并集成了加速求解器方案，以高效处理多触点仿真。此外，它还利用图形处理单元 （GPU） 的并行计算来实时更新有限元模型和

### [Multi-Object Grasping -- Experience Forest for Robotic Finger Movement Strategies]()

This paper introduces a novel Experience Forest algorithm designed for multi-object grasping (MOG). Different from single-object grasping, for MOG, the hand poses a few steps before the end of grasping play important roles in the success of MOG. But similar to single-object grasping, the hand poses that are far away from the end grasping pose are not as relevant. Therefore, the proposed approach invented the Experience Forest structure to organize the finger movement sequences collected in naive MOG approaches with a set of trees instead of a single tree. The algorithm propagates success or failure results in the trials from end-pose nodes only to the nodes representing several preceding hand poses. When using the trees to generate a grasping sequence, the algorithm generates a finger-movement policy that follows a MOG synergy at the beginning and then transits to a tree in the Experience Forest and then employs a breadth-first search to achieve a more reliable solution. Tested on various objects using a UR5e robotic arm and Barrett hand in both simulated and real environments, the strategy significantly boosts efficiency in object transfer tasks by up to 60%, marking a 10% improvement over our previous methods.

### [VMF-Contact: Uncertainty-Aware Evidential Learning for Probabilistic Contact-Grasp in Noisy Clutter]()

Grasp learning in noisy environments, such as occlusions, sensor noise, and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, poses significant challenges. Recent learning-based approaches focus primarily on capturing aleatoric uncertainty from inherent data noise. The epistemic uncertainty, which represents the OOD recognition, is often addressed by ensembles with multiple forward paths, limiting real-time application. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware approach for 6-DoF grasp detection using evidential learning to comprehensively capture both uncertainties in real-world robotic grasping. As a key contribution, we introduce vMF-Contact, a novel architecture for learning hierarchical contact grasp representations with probabilistic modeling of directional uncertainty as von Mises–Fisher (vMF) distribution. To achieve this, we analyze the theoretical formulation of the second-order objective on the posterior parametrization, providing formal guarantees for the model's ability to quantify uncertainty and improve grasp prediction performance. Moreover, we enhance feature expressiveness by applying partial point reconstructions as an auxiliary task, improving the comprehension of uncertainty quantification as well as the generalization to unseen objects. In the real-world experiments, our method demonstrates a significant improvement by 39% in the overall clearance rate compared to the baselines. The code is available under: https://github.com/YitianShi/vMF-Contact/tree/main

### [QuadWBG: Generalizable Quadrupedal Whole-Body Grasping]()

Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.

### [Composing Dextrous Grasping and In-Hand Manipulation Via Scoring with a Reinforcement Learning Critic]()

In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies, reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping) states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system, enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.

### [Bring Your Own Grasp Generator: Leveraging Robot Grasp Generation for Prosthetic Grasping]()

One of the most important research challenges in upper-limb prosthetics is enhancing the user-prosthesis communication to closely resemble the experience of a natural limb. As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience. Code and demo videos are available online at this https URL .

### [AIR-HLoc: Adaptive Retrieved Images Selection for Efficient Visual Localisation]()

State-of-the-art hierarchical localisation pipelines (HLoc) employ image retrieval (IR) to establish 2D-3D correspondences by selecting the top-k most similar images from a reference database. While increasing k improves localisation robustness, it also linearly increases computational cost and runtime, creating a significant bottleneck. This paper investigates the relationship between global and local descriptors, showing that greater similarity between the global descriptors of query and database images increases the proportion of feature matches. Low similarity queries significantly benefit from increasing k, while high similarity queries rapidly experience diminishing returns. Building on these observations, we propose an adaptive strategy that adjusts k based on the similarity between the query's global descriptor and those in the database, effectively mitigating the feature-matching bottleneck. Our approach reduces computational costs and processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on three indoor and outdoor datasets show that AIR-HLoc reduces feature matching time by up to 30% while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy. The results demonstrate that AIR-HLoc facilitates a latency-sensitive localisation system.

### [NeuraLoc: Visual Localization in Neural Implicit Map with Dual Complementary Features]()

Recently, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have gained significant attention in the field of visual localization. However, existing NeRF-based approaches either lack geometric constraints or require extensive storage for feature matching, limiting their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and novel visual localization approach based on the neural implicit map with complementary features. Specifically, to enforce geometric constraints and reduce storage requirements, we implicitly learn a 3D keypoint descriptor field, avoiding the need to explicitly store point-wise features. To further address the semantic ambiguity of descriptors, we introduce additional semantic contextual feature fields, which enhance the quality and reliability of 2D-3D correspondences. Besides, we propose descriptor similarity distribution alignment to minimize the domain gap between 2D and 3D feature spaces during matching. Finally, we construct the matching graph using both complementary descriptors and contextual features to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondences for 6-DoF pose estimation. Compared with the recent NeRF-based approach, our method achieves a 3x faster training speed and a 45x reduction in model storage. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art NeRF-based visual localization methods.

### [LiftFeat: 3D Geometry-Aware Local Feature Matching]()

Robust and efficient local feature matching plays a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and visual localization for robotics. Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called LiftFeat, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released at : https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/LiftFeat.

### [DVS-Aware Visual Perception for Mobile Robots with Neuromorphic Hardware]()

The Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a distinctive visual sensor that exclusively responds to alterations in pixel brightness, enabling the real-time capture of swift and subtle movements with reduced power consumption and data bandwidth requirements. This paper proposes a DVS-aware visual perception method and presents its application for pose estimation of mobile robots. Specifically, a new marker is designed to provide pose reference data that leverages the inherent advantages of DVS more effectively. Moreover, we formulate a pose recognition system incorporating DVS, an algorithm based on Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) and a neuromorphic computing accelerator (Lynxi HS110). Such a formulation can well explore the DVS's advantages, as its event-triggered feature matches the nature of SCNN while the neuromorphic hardware enables efficient, low-power execution, making the system highly suitable for real-time embedded applications. Comparative analysis with traditional ARcode-based pose recognition methods reveals that our innovative approach demonstrates significant advantages in recognition speed and energy efficiency. The whole system is deployed on mobile robots and evaluated in real-world scenarios.

### [Feedback RoI Features Improve Aerial Object Detection]()

Research in visual perception has shown that the human visual system utilizes high-level feedback information to guide lower-level processing, enabling adaptation to signals of varying characteristics. Inspired by this, we propose the Feedback multi-Level feature EXtractor (Flex) to dynamically adjust feature selection in object detection based on image-wise and instance-level feedback information. This is particularly beneficial for applications such as aerial object detection, UAV-based target recognition and autonomous vehicle navigation, where global image quality issues like sensor degradation, foggy, or rainy conditions can impact detection performance. Flex adapts to variations in image quality, refining the feature extraction process to improve robustness against these challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that Flex consistently enhances a range of state-of-the-art methods on challenging aerial object detection datasets, including DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, and HRSC2016. Furthermore, additional experiments on MS COCO confirm the module's effectiveness in general object detection tasks. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that the improvements are strongly correlated with image quality, aligning with our original motivation to address global image quality issues in real-world scenarios.

### [Keypoint Detection and Description for Raw Bayer Images]()

Keypoint detection and local feature description are fundamental tasks in robotic perception, critical for applications such as SLAM, robot localization, feature matching, pose estimation, and 3D mapping. While existing methods predominantly operate on RGB images, we propose a novel network that directly processes raw images, bypassing the need for the Image Signal Processor (ISP). This approach significantly reduces hardware requirements and memory consumption, which is crucial for robotic vision systems. Our method introduces two custom-designed convolutional kernels capable of performing convolutions directly on raw images, preserving inter-channel information without converting to RGB. Experimental results show that our network outperforms existing algorithms on raw images, achieving higher accuracy and stability under large rotations and scale variations. This work represents the first attempt to develop a keypoint detection and feature description network specifically for raw images, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.

### [Delayed-Decision Motion Planning in the Presence of Multiple Predictions]()

Reliable automated driving technology is challenged by various sources of uncertainties, in particular, behavioral uncertainties of traffic agents. It is not uncommon for traffic agents to contain multiple intentions followed by distinguishable maneuvers, and the automated driving car must reflect the uncertainty. This paper formalizes a behavior planning scheme in the presence of multiple possible futures with corresponding probabilities. In essence, we present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety. The general formulation is then turned into a model predictive control formulation, which is solved as a quadratic program or a set of quadratic programs. We discuss implementation details for improving computation and present validation results in simulation and on a mobile robot.

### [Stochastic Trajectory Prediction under Unstructured Constraints]()

Trajectory prediction facilitates effective planning and decision-making, while constrained trajectory prediction integrates regulation into prediction. Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.

### [A Control Barrier Function for Safe Navigation with Online Gaussian Splatting Maps]()

SAFER-Splat (Simultaneous Action Filtering and Environment Reconstruction) is a real-time, scalable, and minimally invasive action filter, based on control barrier functions, for safe robotic navigation in a detailed map constructed at runtime using Gaussian Splatting (GSplat). We propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF) that not only induces safety with respect to all Gaussian primitives in the scene, but when synthesized into a controller, is capable of processing hundreds of thousands of Gaussians while maintaining a minimal memory footprint and operating at 15 Hz during online Splat training. Of the total compute time, a small fraction of it consumes GPU resources, enabling uninterrupted training. The safety layer is minimally invasive, correcting robot actions only when they are unsafe. To showcase the safety filter, we also introduce SplatBridge, an open-source software package built with ROS for real-time GSplat mapping for robots. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline first in simulation, where our method is 20-50x faster, safer, and less conservative than competing methods based on neural radiance fields. Further, we demonstrate simultaneous GSplat mapping and safety filtering on a drone hardware platform using only on-board perception. We verify that under teleoperation a human pilot cannot invoke a collision. Our videos and codebase can be found at https://chengine.github.io/safer-splat.

### [A Skeleton-Based Topological Planner for Exploration in Complex Unknown Environments]()

The capability of autonomous exploration in complex, unknown environments is important in many robotic applications. While recent research on autonomous exploration have achieved much progress, there are still limitations, e.g., existing methods relying on greedy heuristics or optimal path planning are often hindered by repetitive paths and high computational demands.To address such limitations, we propose a novel exploration framework that utilizes the global topology information of observed environment to improve exploration efficiency while reducing computational overhead.Specifically, global information is utilized based on a skeletal topological graph representation of the environment geometry. We first propose an incremental skeleton extraction method based on wavefront propagation, based on which we then design an approach to generate a lightweight topological graph that can effectively capture the environment's structural characteristics. Building upon this, we introduce a finite state machine that leverages the topological structure to efficiently plan coverage paths, which can substantially mitigate the back-and-forth maneuvers (BFMs) problem. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at: url{https://github.com/Haochen-Niu/STGPlanner}.

### [Safety-Critical Online Quadrotor Trajectory Planner for Agile Flights in Unknown Environments]()

Autonomous high-speed flight in unknown, cluttered environments is essential for a variety of quadrotor applications, such as inspection, search, and rescue. In this study, we propose a novel trajectory planner designed to achieve efficient, high-speed, collision-free flights in such environments. The proposed approach begins by generating a safe flight corridor based on the path found by Lazy Theta*, representing the safe regions with polytopic sets. These sets are then used to define discrete-time control barrier function (DCBF), ensuring the quadrotor stays within safe bounds during flight. By selecting one single waypoint ahead of the quadrotor on the path as the next waypoint, the trajectory is optimized by considering both the total flight time and safety constraints. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have confirmed our method's feasibility, demonstrating its capability for high-speed performance and reliable obstacle avoidance.

### [Anytime Replanning of Robot Coverage Paths for Partially Unknown Environments]()

In this paper, we propose a method to replan coverage paths for a robot operating in an environment with initially unknown static obstacles. Existing coverage approaches reduce coverage time by covering along the minimum number of coverage lines (straight-line paths). However, recomputing such paths online can be computationally expensive resulting in robot stoppages that increase coverage time. A naive alternative is greedy detour replanning, i.e., replanning with minimum deviation from the initial path, which is efficient to compute but may result in unnecessary detours. In this work, we propose an anytime coverage replanning approach named OARP-Replan that performs near-optimal replans to an interrupted coverage path within a given time budget. We do this by solving linear relaxations of integer linear programs (ILPs) to identify sections of the interrupted path that can be optimally replanned within the time budget. We validate OARP-Replan in simulation and perform comparisons against a greedy detour replanner and other state-of-the-art coverage planners. We also demonstrate OARP-Replan in experiments using an industrial-level autonomous robot.

### [LeTac-MPC: Learning Model Predictive Control for Tactile-Reactive Grasping]()

Grasping is a crucial task in robotics, necessitating tactile feedback and reactive grasping adjustments for robust grasping of objects under various conditions and with differing physical properties. In this article, we introduce LeTac-MPC, a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for tactile-reactive grasping. Our approach enables the gripper to grasp objects with different physical properties on dynamic and force-interactive tasks. We utilize a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight (Yuan et al. 2017), which is capable of perceiving high-resolution tactile feedback that contains information on the physical properties and states of the grasped object. LeTac-MPC incorporates a differentiable MPC layer designed to model the embeddings extracted by a neural network from tactile feedback. This design facilitates convergent and robust grasping control at a frequency of 25 Hz. We propose a fully automated data collection pipeline and collect a dataset only using standardized blocks with different physical properties. However, our trained controller can generalize to daily objects with different sizes, shapes, materials, and textures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. We compare LeTac-MPC with two purely model-based tactile-reactive controllers (MPC and PD) and open-loop grasping. Our results show that LeTac-MPC has optimal performance in dynamic and force-interactive tasks and optimal generalizability.

### [The Role of Tactile Sensing for Learning Reach and Grasp]()

Stable and robust robotic grasping is essential for current and future robot applications. In recent works, the use of large datasets and supervised learning has enhanced speed and precision in antipodal grasping. However, these methods struggle with perception and calibration errors due to large planning horizons. To obtain more robust and reactive grasping motions, leveraging reinforcement learning combined with tactile sensing is a promising direction. Yet, there is no systematic evaluation of how the complexity of force-based tactile sensing affects the learning behavior for grasping tasks. This paper compares various tactile and environmental setups using two model-free reinforcement learning approaches for antipodal grasping. Our findings suggest that under imperfect visual perception, various tactile features improve learning outcomes, while complex tactile inputs complicate training.

### [Task-Specific Embodied Tactile Sensing for Dexterous Hand]()

In order to obtain a good tactile sensing, traditional dexterous hands always enable all the sensing units installed on them all the time, even if just a few sensor units are actually used, which make the tactile sensing system resource-wasting and energy consuming. In order to reduce their complexities by placing the tactile sensing units only at critical locations, this work proposes an embodied tactile dexterous hand (ET-Hand) and a novel multimodal sensor placement framework that learns multiple tasks to generate optimal placement proposal. Furthermore, our ET-Hand can dynamically adjust the perceived tactile sensor positions, types and numbers during robotic manipulation, providing novel tools and methods for investigating the tactile channels and placement scale required for robot exploration. In the object recognition and slip detection tasks, the results show that our proposed method performs close to or even better than traditional sensing way with large-scale placement.

### [TacDiffusion: Force-Domain Diffusion Policy for Precise Tactile Manipulation]()

Assembly is a crucial skill for robots in both modern manufacturing and service robotics. However, mastering transferable insertion skills that can handle a variety of high-precision assembly tasks remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes diffusion models to generate 6D wrench for high-precision tactile robotic insertion tasks. It learns from demonstrations performed on a single task and achieves a zero-shot transfer success rate of 95.7% across various novel high-precision tasks. Our method effectively inherits the self-adaptability demonstrated by our previous work. In this framework, we address the frequency misalignment between the diffusion policy and the real-time control loop with a dynamic system-based filter, significantly improving the task success rate by 9.15%. Furthermore, we provide a practical guideline regarding the trade-off between diffusion models' inference ability and speed.

### [UpViTaL: Unpaired Visual-Tactile Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Dexterous Robotic Manipulation]()

Visual and tactile pretraining have been extensively studied in dexterous robot manipulation tasks. However, existing methods typically require the simultaneous acquisition of visual and tactile data, making it difficult to utilize low-cost, unpaired visual-tactile datasets. Moreover, these methods often rely on tactile sensors to provide input data for reinforcement learning (RL) during the physical deployment of robotic dexterous hands, which highly increases deployment costs. To address these challenges, we propose UpViTaL, an unpaired visual- tactile self-supervised representation learning method for RL- based robot dexterous manipulation. Specifically, we collect low-cost unpaired visual and tactile datasets for manipulation skill learning using a camera and tactile gloves on three robot manipulation tasks. The temporal tactile self-supervised representation learning module of UpViTaL is used to explore efficient tactile representations from time-series tactile data. In parallel, the visual pretraining module of UpViTaL helps to extract efficient visual representations from visual data. In addition, we fuse unpaired visual-tactile representations through an RL reward mechanism, which does not require robotic dexterous hands tactile sensors for practical deployment. We validate our approach on three dexterous robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that UpViTaL can efficiently learn robot manipulation skills. Compared to existing approaches for visual pretraining, our method significantly improves the success rate by more than 30%.

### [Trust-Preserved Human-Robot Shared Autonomy Enabled by Bayesian Relational Event Modeling]()

Shared autonomy functions as a flexible framework that empowers robots to operate across a spectrum of autonomy levels, allowing for efficient task execution with minimal human oversight. However, humans might be intimidated by the autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots due to perceived risks and a lack of trust. This paper proposed a trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy that allows robots to seamlessly adjust their autonomy level, striving to optimize team performance and enhance their acceptance among human collaborators. By enhancing the relational event modeling framework with Bayesian learning techniques, this paper enables dynamic inference of human trust based solely on time-stamped relational events communicated within human-robot teams. Adopting a longitudinal perspective on trust development and calibration in human-robot teams, the proposed trust-preserved shared autonomy strategy warrants robots to actively establish, maintain, and repair human trust, rather than merely passively adapting to it. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a user study on a human-robot collaborative search and rescue scenario. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate its merits on both task execution and user acceptability over the baseline approach that does not consider the preservation of trust.

### [Fostering Trust through Gesture and Voice-Controlled Robot Trajectories in Industrial Human-Robot Collaboration]()

In the Industry 5.0 era, the focus shifts from basic automation to fostering collaboration between humans and robots. Trust is crucial in this new paradigm, enabling smooth interaction, especially for users with limited robotics knowledge. This study presents a novel framework that uses human hand gestures and voice commands to control robot movements, aiming to enhance trust, reduce cognitive workload, and minimize task execution time—key for efficient manufacturing. In automated systems, swift completion of micromanagement tasks is essential to prevent process disruption. To evaluate this framework, we devised a testbed scenario within an automated carbon fiber transportation and draping process, focusing on a maintenance task as the micromanagement challenge. Participants inspected the gripper, guided the robot along a defined path, and performed maintenance, such as attaching cables. Two conditions were tested: gestures and voice commands versus a smartPAD. The results showed that gestures and voice commands increased trust, lowered cognitive load, and shortened execution times, improving overall manufacturing efficiency.

### [Would You Trust Me Now? a Study on Trust Repair Strategies in Human-Robot Collaboration]()

As robots are prone to make errors that undermine trust, effective trust repair strategies are essential in effective human-robot collaboration. Our lab study evaluates three trust repair strategies --apology, denial, and compensation-- following two types of trust violations: competence-based and integrity-based. Consistent with prior research, integrity-based violations reduced moral trust more, while competence-based violations impacted performance trust. Denial caused greater discomfort than apology or compensation across both violation types. Dispositional trust influenced repair strategies effectiveness, particularly in willingness to engage and re-engage. Notably, individuals with high dispositional trust were more receptive to apologies. These findings underscore the need to consider individual trust differences, suggesting robots should assess human trust disposition to effectively foster continued collaboration.

### [Using Physiological Measures, Gaze, and Facial Expressions to Model Human Trust in a Robot Partner]()

With robots becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, it has become crucial to equip them with tools to achieve greater fluency in interactions with humans. One of the promising areas for further exploration lies in human trust. A real-time, objective model of human trust could be used to maximize productivity, preserve safety, and mitigate failure. In this work, we attempt to use physiological measures, gaze, and facial expressions to model human trust in a robot partner. We are the first to design an in-person, human-robot supervisory interaction study to create a dedicated trust dataset. Using this dataset, we train machine learning algorithms to identify the objective measures that are most indicative of trust in a robot partner, advancing trust prediction in human-robot interactions. Our findings indicate that a combination of sensor modalities (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and gaze) can enhance the accuracy of detecting human trust in a robot partner. Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner. These results lay the groundwork for constructing a real-time trust model for human-robot interaction, which could foster more efficient interactions between humans and robots.

### [A Novel Computational Framework of Robot Trust for Human-Robot Teams]()

When humans collaborate, they form positive or negative experiences with each other. These experiences depend on various factors such as the individual's skills, abilities, and agency. In this paper, we consider human-robot collaborations and present a novel model of an autonomous robot's trust in humans based on the probability of the robot having a positive experience with the human. The model defines a dynamic trust-building process that translates into a computationally-accessible implementation. We hypothesize predictors of a positive experience with human teammates and derive trust in individual humans. As the interactions continue, team members develop an affinity toward each other. The robot's affinity towards humans can be viewed as kinship, and we also investigate how kinship affects trust and distrust. We present an algorithm for how the robot may use kinship-mediated trust in its decision-making, and demonstrate its use in simulated missions truly requiring human-robot collaboration.

### [Modeling Trust Dynamics in Robot-Assisted Delivery: Impact of Trust Repair Strategies]()

With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust. In this task, humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually control it while handling a secondary task. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long explanations, apology and promise, and denial. Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at preventing trust loss. We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

### [Planning for Tabletop Object Rearrangement]()

Finding an high-quality solution for the tabletop object rearrangement planning is a challenging problem. Compared to determining a goal arrangement, rearrangement planning is challenging due to the dependencies between objects and the buffer capacity available to hold objects. Although ORLA* has proposed an A* based searching strategy with lazy evaluation for the optimal solution, it is not scalable, with the success rate decreasing as the number of objects increases. Additionally, for noisy state representations, ORLA* provides only suboptimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced A*-based algorithm that improves state representation and employs incremental goal attempts with lazy evaluation at each iteration. This approach aims to enhance scalability while maintaining solution quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can provide superior solutions compared to ORLA*, in a shorter time, for both stationary and mobile robots.

### [DA-VIL: Adaptive Dual-Arm Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning and Variable Impedance Control]()

Dual-arm manipulation is an area of growing interest in the robotics community. Enabling robots to perform tasks that require the coordinated use of two arms, is essential for complex manipulation tasks such as handling complex large objects, assembling components, and performing human-like interactions. However, achieving effective dual-arm manipulation is challenging due to the need for precise coordination, dynamic adaptability, and the ability to manage interaction forces between the arms and the objects being manipulated. We propose a novel pipeline that combines advantages of policy learning based on environment feedback and gradient based optimization to learn controller gains as well as the control outputs. This allows the robotic system to dynamically modulate its impedance in response to task demands, ensuring stability and dexterity in dual-arm operations. We evaluate our pipeline on a trajectory-tracking task involving a variety of large, complex objects with different masses and geometries. The performance is then compared to three other established methods for controlling dual-arm robots, demonstrating superior results.

### [Goal-Driven Robotic Pushing Manipulation under Uncertain Object Properties]()

Robotic pushing is one of the intuitive non-prehensile manipulation skills that can handle ungraspable objects without any complex task-specific tools. In this paper, we proposed a goal-driven accurate robotic pushing framework to achieve the robotic pushing tasks in practice that can operate under uncertain object properties. We employed a model predictive path integral (MPPI) as a goal-driven pushing controller building upon our prior work to operate pushing tasks under uncertain object properties. Unlike our prior work, the proposed framework can push the object toward the goal pose without predefined trajectories. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed framework can accomplish the pushing task with a significantly shorter total length, smaller total step, and a higher success rate even though the model parameters are unknown. Moreover, we demonstrated the proposed framework also works well in the real world through real-robot demonstrations.

### [Synthesizing Grasps and Regrasps for Complex Manipulation Tasks]()

In complex manipulation tasks, e.g., manipulation by pivoting, the motion of the object being manipulated has to satisfy path constraints that can change during the motion. Therefore, a single grasp may not be sufficient for the entire path, and the object may need to be regrasped. Additionally, geometric data for objects from a sensor are usually available in the form of point clouds. The problem of computing grasps and regrasps from point-cloud representation of objects for complex manipulation tasks is a key problem in endowing robots with manipulation capabilities beyond pick-and-place. In this paper, we formalize the problem of grasping/regrasping for complex manipulation tasks with objects represented by (partial) point clouds and present an algorithm to solve it. We represent a complex manipulation task as a sequence of constant screw motions. Using a manipulation plan skeleton as a sequence of constant screw motions, we use a grasp metric to find graspable regions on the object for every constant screw segment. The overlap of the graspable regions for contiguous screws are then used to determine when and how many times the object needs to be regrasped. We present experimental results on point cloud data collected from RGB-D sensors to illustrate our approach.

### [A Helping (Human) Hand in Kinematic Structure Estimation]()

Visual uncertainties such as occlusions, lack of texture, and noise present significant challenges in obtaining accurate kinematic models for safe robotic manipulation. We introduce a probabilistic real-time approach that leverages the human hand as a prior to mitigate these uncertainties. By tracking the constrained motion of the human hand during manipulation and explicitly modeling uncertainties in visual observations, our method reliably estimates an object’s kinematic model online. We validate our approach on a novel dataset featuring challenging objects that are occluded during manipulation and offer limited articulations for perception. The results demonstrate that by incorporating an appropriate prior and explicitly accounting for uncertainties, our method produces accurate estimates, outperforming two recent baselines by 195% and 140%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach's estimates are precise enough to allow a robot to manipulate even small objects safely.

### [Is Linear Feedback on Smoothed Dynamics Sufficient for Stabilizing Contact-Rich Plans?]()

Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.

### [Interaction-Driven Updates: 3D Scene Graph Maintenance During Robot Task Execution]()

Robots powered by large language model (LLM) demonstrate significant research and application potential by effectively interpreting scene information to respond to human commands. However, when robots rely on static scene information during task execution, they face difficulties in adapting to changes in the environment, posing a major challenge for dynamic scene perception. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative interaction-driven approach to enhance robots' ability to perceive dynamic scene information. This approach consists of two contributions, the observation point selection module and the dynamic scene maintenance module. Specifically, first, the robot uses the 3D scene graph (3DSG) containing assets and objects to perceive static scene information through the LLM planner. Next, the best observation point for each asset is obtained through the observation point selection module. Then, with the help of the best observation point, the dynamic scene maintenance module interacts with the asset-related objects to dynamically update all the object node information related to the asset node. This approach enables robots to maintain dynamic scene information, enhancing their adaptability in unpredictable environments and improving task reliability.We evaluated our method using the iTHOR and RoboTHOR datasets within the AI2-THOR simulator and in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively and accurately maintains robots' perception of dynamic scene information.

### [ME-PATS: Mutually Enhancing Search-Based Planner and Learning-Based Agent for Tractor-Trailer Systems]()

Planning a kinodynamically feasible path for a tractor-trailer vehicle is challenging for both search-based and learning-based methods due to the vehicle’s unique kinematics and complex obstacles. These factors increase the likelihood of infeasible paths and exacerbate long-horizon issues. We introduce ME-PATS: a framework that mutually enhances the search-based planner and the learning-based agent for tractor-trailer systems. The search-based planner provides successful trajectories to help the learning-based agent update its policy, while the agent improves the planner’s efficiency through direct path simulation. Additionally, we propose two approaches to apply our framework to more challenging tasks: designing obstacle-aware networks to enhance the learning-based agent’s capabilities, and combining the planner’s paths with the trained agent’s simulated paths through multi-segment integration. Full details and results are available on our project website at href{https://github.com/FrankSinatral/TTsystems}{https://g ithub.com/FrankSinatral/TTsystems}.

### [Jailbreaking LLM-Controlled Robots]()

The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive human-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and self-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit harmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of deploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first algorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual attacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from LLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three scenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the NVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker has partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a GPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only query access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each scenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we demonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds jailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates. Our results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs extend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that jailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our results on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a deployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is critical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media is available at: https://robopair.org.

### [CaStL: Constraints As Specifications through LLM Translation for Long-Horizon Task and Motion Planning]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability in long-horizon Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) by translating clear and straightforward natural language problems into formal specifications such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). However, real-world problems are often ambiguous and involve many complex constraints. In this paper, we introduce Constraints as Specifications through LLMs (CaStL), a framework that identifies constraints such as goal conditions, action ordering, and action blocking from natural language in multiple stages. CaStL translates these constraints into PDDL and Python scripts, which are solved using an custom PDDL solver. Tested across three PDDL domains, CaStL significantly improves constraint handling and planning success rates from natural language specification in complex scenarios.

### [Skills Made to Order: Efficient Acquisition of Robot Cooking Skills Guided by Multiple Forms of Internet Data]()

This study explores the utility of various internet data sources to select among a set of template robot behaviors to perform skills. Learning contact-rich skills involving tool use from internet data sources has typically been challenging due to the lack of physical information such as contact existence, location, areas, and force in this data. Prior works have generally used internet data and foundation models trained on this data to generate low-level robot behavior. We hypothesize that these data and models may be better suited to selecting among a set of basic robot behaviors to perform these contact-rich skills. We explore three methods of template selection: querying large language models, comparing video of robot execution to retrieved human video using features from a pretrained video encoder common in prior work, and performing the same comparison using features from an optic flow encoder trained on internet data. Our results show that LLMs are surprisingly capable template selectors despite their lack of visual information, optical flow encoding significantly outperforms video encoders trained with an order of magnitude more data, and important synergies exist between various forms of internet data for template selection. By exploiting these synergies, we create a template selector using multiple forms of internet data that achieves a 79% success rate on a set of 16 different cooking skills involving tool-use.

### [LEMMo-Plan: LLM-Enhanced Learning from Mutli-Modal Demonstration for Planning Sequential Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in task planning for long-horizon manipulation tasks. To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots. In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance the LLM's ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations. Real-world experiments on two different sequential manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving LLMs' understanding of multi-modal demonstrations and enhancing the overall planning performance.

### [LTLDoG: Satisfying Temporally-Extended Symbolic Constraints for Safe Diffusion-Based Planning]()

Operating effectively in complex environments while complying with specified constraints is crucial for the safe and successful deployment of robots that interact with and operate around people. In this work, we focus on generating long-horizon trajectories that adhere to novel static and temporally-extended constraints/instructions at test time. We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic (LTLf). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on LTLf and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.

### [DARE: Diffusion Policy for Autonomous Robot Exploration]()

Autonomous robot exploration requires a robot to efficiently explore and map unknown environments. Compared to conventional methods that can only optimize paths based on the current robot belief, learning-based methods show the potential to achieve improved performance by drawing on past experiences to reason about unknown areas. In this paper, we propose DARE, a novel generative approach that leverages diffusion models trained on expert demonstrations, which can explicitly generate an exploration path through one-time inference. We build DARE upon an attention-based encoder and a diffusion model, and introduce ground truth optimal demonstrations for training to learn better patterns for exploration. The trained planner can reason about the partial belief to recognize the potential structure in unknown areas and consider these areas during path planning. Our experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves on-par performance with both conventional and learning-based state-of-the-art exploration planners, as well as good generalizability in both simulations and real-life scenarios.

### [NaviDiffusor: Cost-Guided Diffusion Model for Visual Navigation]()

Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods. Code will be released at url{https://github.com/SYSU-RoboticsLab/NaviD}.

### [NavigateDiff: Visual Predictors Are Zero-Shot Navigation Assistants]()

Navigating unfamiliar environments presents significant challenges for household robots, requiring the ability to recognize and reason about novel decoration and layout. Existing reinforcement learning methods cannot be directly transferred to new environments, as they typically rely on extensive mapping and exploration, leading to time-consuming and inefficient. To address these challenges, we try to transfer the logical knowledge and the generalization ability of pre-trained foundation models to zero-shot navigation. By integrating a large vision-language model with a diffusion network, our approach named NavigateDiff constructs a visual predictor that continuously predicts the agent's potential observations in the next step which can assist robots generate robust actions. Furthermore, to adapt the temporal property of navigation, we introduce temporal historical information to ensure that the predicted image is aligned with the navigation scene. We then carefully designed an information fusion framework that embeds the predicted future frames as guidance into goal-reaching policy to solve downstream image navigation tasks. This approach enhances navigation control and generalization across both simulated and real-world environments. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our method, showcasing its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of robotic navigation in diverse settings.

### [FDPP: Fine-Tune Diffusion Policy with Human Preference]()

Imitation learning from human demonstrations enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks and has recently witnessed huge success. However, these techniques often struggle to adapt behavior to new preferences or changes in the environment. To address these limitations, we propose Fine-tuning Diffusion Policy with Human Preference (FDPP). FDPP learns a reward function through preference-based learning. This reward is then used to fine-tune the pre-trained policy with reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in alignment of pre-trained policy with new human preferences while still solving the original task. Our experiments across various robotic tasks and preferences demonstrate that FDPP effectively customizes policy behavior without compromising performance. Additionally, we show that incorporating Kullback–Leibler (KL) regularization during fine-tuning prevents over-fitting and helps maintain the competencies of the initial policy.

### [Learning Diverse Robot Striking Motions with Diffusion Models and Kinematically Constrained Gradient Guidance]()

Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we achieved a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.

### [Probabilistically-Safe Bipedal Navigation Over Uncertain Terrain Via Conformal Prediction and Contraction Analysis]()

This work presents a high-level navigation framework for bipedal robot that accounts for terrain uncertainty in footstep planning and motion control. Given a terrain map estimated via Gaussian Process (GP) model with nonstationary kernel, we leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct tighter coverage guarantee intervals containing the true terrain elevations. We also formulate a soft CP constraint to ensure safe foot height changes between successive footfalls with probabilistic guarantee. Additionally, we model the CP coverage intervals as a bounded disturbance model which are incorporated into linear inverted pendulum plus flywheel (LIP) model. Given the LIP model with bounded disturbances arising from uncertain terrain, we formulate a flywheel torque control law using Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs). We then design a Robust Control Invariant (RCI) Tube around the desired Center of Mass (CoM) phase-space trajectory, defining a region in which the system states can be stabilized by the flywheel torque control law. This ensures the maintenance of a constant CoM height (or constant surface slope) despite terrain uncertainty. The overall framework results in an uncertainty-informed Model Predictive Controller (MPC) provides probabilistic safety guarantees, enabling robust locomotion across uncertain environments. This approach enhances the robot’s ability to navigate complex, unstructured terrains while maintaining stability in real-world deployment.

### [Robotic Tissue Manipulation in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: Late Breaking Results]()

To address the steep learning curve associated with ESD, we reengineered the tissue clip by introducing a magnetic mechanism to improve submucosal exposure and facilitate precise dissection. Furthermore, we proposed a robotic manipulation method that automates the motion of an external magnet mounted on a robotic arm to enhance operational efficiency. Based on simulation trials using ROS Gazebo (ICRA 2025 accepted, manuscript # 4388), which demonstrated promising results, we further evaluated the proposed method in a 3D-printed stomach and ex vivo setup using a clinical gastroscope (Olympus EVIS EXERA III GIF-1TH190). By labeling and training over 21,000 images captured from the gastroscope using a deep learning-based YOLO (You Only Look Once) method, we successfully deployed the magnetic robotic tissue manipulation system, integrating the robotic arm, Olympus gastroscope, mock-up and ex vivo tissue. In 42 trials using a 3D-printed stomach, the magnetic robotic manipulation system was able to orient the internal magnetic clip—clamped onto the tissue—to the desired angle (±35 degrees) in 55.36 ± 7.64 seconds (mean ± standard error, n = 42). Additionally, ex vivo trials using porcine stomach tissue recorded a performance time of 37.19 ± 3.78 seconds over 36 trials. These results lay the groundwork for future validation in in vivo scenarios.

### [Shared Mental Models Improve Performance in Human-Robot Teams During Unforeseen Events]()

As robots increasingly integrate into human environments, there is growing optimism about expanding and diversifying human-robot team (HRT) missions. However, existing approaches, which primarily rely on teleoperation and contingency handling, encounter limitations such as cognitive overload and scalability challenges. A user study was conducted to investigate how Shared Mental Models (SMMs) influence HRTs' problem-solving abilities when faced with novel challenges. The results revealed that a General SMM (GSMM) significantly improved task performance compared to a Specific SMM (SSMM), although the SMM type did not significantly impact overall team adaptability. Additionally, the ability to handle uncertain situations was crucial for performance.

### [Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying Diffusion/flow Policies by Treating Robot Trajectories As Flow Trajectories]()

Recent advances in diffusion/flow policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories for robotic control. However, they are slow because they sample a trajectory of trajectories—a diffusion/flow trajectory of robot trajectories. They discard intermediate robot trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. In this work, we propose a novel framework that simplifies diffusion/flow policies by treating robot trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm starts from the current robot configuration, and incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of robot configurations that constitute a single trajectory. This enables computed actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, for significantly faster and reactive policies. It is well-suited for receding horizon control where we can adaptively generate only as many actions as are executed on the robot, and no more. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We show that training flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories reduces distribution shift and improves imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior diffusion/flow policies on imitation learning benchmarks while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor control loops.

### [Battery-Free Computer Vision on Insect-Scale Microrobots]()

The goal of this project is to enable the use of efficient on-device deep learning models for battery-free mobility-based sensing robots. We target the deployment of these models on MilliMobile, a one square centimeter microrobotic platform with only 512 KB of RAM and 1 MB of flash memory (millimobile.cs.washington.edu), making it challenging to run traditional models onboard. We address this challenge by integrating intermittent computing and motion with image-based sensing, ensuring that the system only performs high-power actions–like locomotion, inference, and communication–when specific conditions are satisfied. Event-based vision and intermittent computing approaches will also be leveraged to optimize the MCUs time in ultra-low-power modes. We train on insect images from Insect Detect - insect classification dataset v2 and achieve almost 70% accuracy after 500 epochs with milliWatts of power consumed when running the system on the nRF52840 microcontroller.

### [Implicit Behavioral Cues for Enhanced Pedestrian Comfort in Robot Social Navigation]()

Robots operating in public spaces must navigate alongside humans in ways that are not only safe but also intuitive and socially acceptable. In particular, how a robot communicates its navigation intent can significantly impact pedestrian comfort and trust. In this work, we explore how different robot behaviors - ranging from no cue to implicit (speed and trajectory adjustments) and explicit (verbal) signals - affect pedestrian perception during hallway encounters. We conducted a pilot user study with 12 participants, where a robot approached the participant from the front or side using one of five cue strategies. Subjective ratings (comfort, trust, clarity, predictability, and proxemics) and objective measures (hesitation, passing time) were collected. Results indicate that trajectory cues led to the highest perceived comfort and clarity, while sudden stops and no cues caused more confusion and hesitation. These findings highlight the potential of motion-based implicit cues to improve the legibility of robot navigation in shared human environments.

### [Spectral Bayesian Inference and Neural Estimation of Acoustic Wave Propagation]()

We present a novel framework integrating physics and machine learning to estimate frequency-domain acoustic wave propagation coefficients. Using acoustic waveforms captured at speaker-receiver pairs, we estimate attenuation and wavenumber via: (1) Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware learning from small and noisy data, (2) a neural-physical model trained with forward-backward physical losses, and (3) non-linear least squares as baseline. With inferred propagation coefficients, room impulse responses (RIRs) are derived, enabling robot relocalisation with uncertainty quantification.

### [Analyzing Human Perceptions of a MEDEVAC Robot in a Simulated Evacuation Scenario]()

The use of autonomous systems in medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) scenarios is promising, but existing implementations overlook key insights from human-robot interaction (HRI) research. Studies on human-machine teams demonstrate that human perceptions of a machine teammate are critical in governing the machine's performance. Consequently, it is essential to identify the factors that contribute to positive human perceptions in human-machine teams. Here, we present a mixed factorial design to assess human perceptions of a MEDEVAC robot in a simulated evacuation scenario. Participants were assigned to the role of casualty (CAS) or bystander (BYS) and subjected to three within-subjects conditions based on the MEDEVAC robot's operating mode: autonomous-slow (AS), autonomous-fast (AF), and teleoperation (TO). During each trial, a MEDEVAC robot navigated an 11-meter path, acquiring a casualty and transporting them to an ambulance exchange point while avoiding an idle bystander. Following each trial, subjects completed a questionnaire measuring their emotional states, perceived safety, and social compatibility with the robot. Results indicate a consistent main effect of operating mode on reported emotional states and perceived safety. Pairwise analyses suggest that the employment of the AF operating mode negatively impacted perceptions along these dimensions. There were no persistent differences between CAS and BYS responses.

### [FRESHR-GSI: A Generalized Safety Model and Evaluation Framework for Mobile Robots in Multi-Human Environments]()

Human safety is critical in applications involving close human-robot interactions (HRI) and is a key aspect of physical compatibility between humans and robots. While measures of human safety in HRI exist, these mainly target industrial settings involving robotic manipulators. Less attention has been paid to settings where mobile robots and humans share the space. This paper introduces a new robot-centered directional framework of human safety. It is particularly useful for evaluating mobile robots as they operate in environments populated by multiple humans. The framework integrates several key metrics, such as each human's relative distance, speed, and orientation. The core novelty lies in the framework's flexibility to accommodate different application requirements while allowing for both the robot-centered and external observer points of view. We instantiate the framework by using RGB-D based vision integrated with a deep learning-based human detection pipeline to yield a proxemics-guided generalized safety index (GSI) that instantaneously assesses human safety. We extensively validate GSI's capability of producing appropriate and fine-grained safety measures in real-world experimental scenarios and demonstrate its superior efficacy against extant safety models.

### [Variable Stiffness Quasi-Direct Drive Cable-Actuated Tensegrity Robot with Visuotactile Contact Sensor]()

Tensegrity robots excel in tasks requiring extreme levels of deformability and robustness. However, there are challenges in state estimation and payload versatility due to their high number of degrees of freedom and unconventional shape. This work introduces a modular three-bar tensegrity robot featuring a customizable payload design. The modular exoskeleton supports scalable configurations and efficient packaging of sensing and computation Our tensegrity robot employs a novel Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD) cable actuator with low-stretch polymer cables to achieve accurate proprioception without needing external force or torque sensors. The design allows for on-the-fly stiffness tuning for better environment and payload adaptability. Experimental data demonstrates the high accuracy cable length estimation (<1% error relative to bar length) and variable stiffness control of the cable actuator up to 7 times the minimum stiffness for self support. To augment proprioception with environmental feedback, we develop a scalable, open-source visuotactile sensor embedded within each endcap of the tensegrity structure. The presented tensegrity robot is a platform for future advancements in autonomous operation and open-source module design.

### [OceanSim: A GPU-Accelerated Underwater Robot Perception Simulation Framework]()

Underwater simulators offer support for building robust underwater perception solutions. Significant work has recently been done to develop new simulators and to advance the performance of existing underwater simulators. Still, there remains room for improvement on physics-based underwater sensor modeling and rendering efficiency. In this paper, we propose OceanSim, a high-fidelity GPU-accelerated underwater simulator to address this research gap. We propose advanced physics-based rendering techniques to reduce the sim-to-real gap for underwater image simulation. We develop OceanSim to fully leverage the computing advantages of GPUs and achieve real-time imaging sonar rendering and fast synthetic data generation. We evaluate the capabilities and realism of OceanSim using real-world data to provide qualitative and quantitative results.

### [Bayesian Intent Inference Via Egocentric Vision and Gesture Recognition]()

Many robotic assistive devices require users to perform explicit commanding actions, such as pressing buttons or tilting their bodies, to initiate assistance. However, it would be more natural if the device could infer intent implicitly. Prior work has explored intent prediction using different sensor modalities, such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Some vision-based approaches rely on external cameras to analyze human action from a third person perspective. While these methods can provide useful insights, they either focus only on body signals without considering environmental context or require external cameras that are impractical for wearable robotics. In contrast, first-person vision offers a direct perspective of how users interact with their surroundings, yet it remains underexplored in intent inference research. We propose a hybrid approach that utilizes a Bayesian network to probabilistically fuse first-person visual context with body motion data to understand human intent. Unlike some prior work that uses computer vision only for perception, our approach reasons about the contextual affordances of objects in environment and integrates it with human motion to improve both prediction accuracy and explainability. Our results show the feasibility of this approach in controlled experiments, and future research could expand on this work to improve robustness and generalizability in real-world environments.

### [Geometric and Dynamic Modeling of McKibben Muscles for Soft Robotic Control Applications]()

Soft robotic systems offer remarkable adaptability and safety in dynamic environments, but their compliant structures introduce complex, nonlinear behaviors that challenge traditional modeling and control techniques. This paper proposes a unified modeling and control framework for pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs), with emphasis on McKibben actuators in both rectilinear and curvilinear configurations. Recognizing the limitations of linear modeling for soft robotics, the framework is extended to include nonlinearities of soft body dynamics by incorporating nonlinear stiffness and damping terms, enabling accurate representation of hyper-elastic and viscoelastic behavior.

### [Enhanced Diagnostic Imaging Via Robotic Arc Ultrasound Scanning and 3d Reconstruction]()

This study presents a robotic ultrasound imaging system designed to enhance diagnostic image quality through arc-based scanning trajectories and 3D reconstruction. Building on prior work in robotic linear ultrasound for musculoskeletal imaging, we introduce an arc scanning approach that aligns more perpendicularly to curved anatomical surfaces—such as finger joints—thereby improving bone and soft tissue visualization. Our integrated system combines a GE Vivid E95 ultrasound scanner with a Universal Robots UR3 robotic arm to perform automated B-mode, Color Flow Mapping (CFM), and photoacoustic scans. The scanning procedure consists of initial alignment, trajectory execution, motion compensation, and volume reconstruction, with interpolation based on proximity-weighted pixels from the nearest planes. We conducted phantom, volunteer, and patient studies to evaluate performance. Quantitative results from phantom scans demonstrated that the arc scan offers sharper boundary contrast. In both volunteer and patient cases, arc scans consistently produced more continuous and symmetric bone surfaces with uniform soft tissue appearance in B-mode imaging. However, CFM scans revealed fewer motion artifacts and clearer vascular signals in linear trajectories, suggesting arc-induced mechanical wave artifacts. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each trajectory, motivating future work on hybrid scanning that integrates both linear and arc paths for optimized diagnostics.

### [Optimizing Topological Mapping for Robotics: Integrating Delaunay-Cech Filtration and Discrete Gradient Vector Fields]()

In this research, we explore the integration of topological data analysis techniques, specifically simplicial complexes and filtrations, with Discrete Morse Theory to enhance robotic motion planning and environmental mapping. While Vietoris-Rips complexes offer computational efficiency and Cˇech complexes capture topological features more accurately, combining these tools within a Discrete Morse Theory framework allows for simplification and identification of critical points in the configuration space without changing the topology of the structure. A central motivation for this work is the search for a simplicial complex that balances the topological accuracy of Cech complexes with the lower computational demands of Vietoris-Rips complexes. While creating such a complex is a challenging task, this trade-off drives the development of more efficient and accurate representations of space for robotics. Additionally, this research addresses the difficulty of identifying local minima and maxima in higher-dimensional settings, extending the utility of Discrete Morse Theory. Building on these ideas, we explore hybrid approaches involving Delaunay-Cˇech filtrations and Discrete Gradient Vector Fields to create more adaptive topological representations.

### [Tensegrity Robot Proprioceptive State Estimation with Geometric Constraints]()

This paper presents a novel proprioceptive state estimator for tensegrity robots, addressing the challenges posed by their unique structural configurations and dynamic behaviors. The tensegrity robot, constructed from a synergistic assembly of rigid rods and elastic cables, is designed for high-impact tolerance and shape morphing. To accurately capture both the global pose and internal shape of the robot in real time, our approach fuses high-frequency inertial measurements from onboard IMUs with precise cable length data from motor encoders. An optimization-based shape reconstruction algorithm—enforced by rigorous geometric and chirality constraints—is employed to estimate the endcap positions in the body frame, overcoming the complexities inherent in its continuously deforming configuration. To further enhance the estimator's robustness, the forward kinematics from shape reconstruction is integrated into a contact-aided Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework. This filter leverages detected endcap-ground contact events to correct state estimates via forward kinematics, ensuring improved accuracy even in scenarios with camera occlusions or degraded environmental conditions. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the proposed framework, achieving an average drift of approximately 4.2% while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for onboard autonomous operations. Overall, this work not only advances state estimation methodologies for tense

### [SkillWrapper: Autonomously Learning Interpretable Skill Abstractions with Foundation Models]()

We envision a future where robots are equipped "out of the box" with portable skills. However, to effectively deploy and compose these skills for robotic tasks, users must know about the conditions under which they can be successfully executed and the consequences of the execution; in task planning, these are known as an action's preconditions and effects. We present SkillWrapper: an approach that automatically learns human-interpretable abstractions of skills, while guaranteeing complete and sound representations for planning, enabling long-horizon skill composition and zero-shot generalization. Our approach exploits foundation models to propose tasks from which it then learns a semantically meaningful grounded representations of preconditions and effects given images of what the robot perceives before and after executing a skill.

### [Batch Learning of Koopman Operators from Streaming Data of Off-Road Vehicle with Terrain Dynamics]()

Autonomous off-road vehicles generate rich, high-frequency sensor data that capture complex and nonlinear interactions with unstructured terrain. While terrain dynamics are often modeled using physics-based approaches like Bekker models, such methods are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time use. Moreover, streaming data may contain rare or regime-specific events critical for effective modeling and control. This work addresses the challenge of updating Koopman operator-based models in real time without overwhelming memory and computational resources. Rather than storing all incoming data or discarding potentially useful samples, we propose a batch update method that selectively incorporates only informative datasets. Novelty in dynamics is detected using the Grassmannian distance between subspaces, enabling efficient identification of meaningful regime shifts.Our approach significantly reduces data volume and computational load while preserving model accuracy. Additionally, it includes basis function learning to optimize the Koopman representation. The framework is validated on simulated systems, demonstrating effective online learning, reduced model complexity, and improved prediction and control performance in off-road environments.

### [Data-Driven Prediction Model of Soft-Tissue Surface Deformation During Robotic Palpation]()

Biological shape deformation resulting from robot palpation is a challenging problem in surgical robotics due to the complex contact modeling of tool-tissue interaction. The existing methods mainly focused on the development of model-based frameworks (e.g. Finite element analysis) and the use of force sensing to build a shape prediction model. However, these models are either computationally expensive or susceptible to the changes of tool configurations and tissue properties. To overcome this problem, we present an entirely data-driven method for soft-tissue surface prediction during robot palpation. We implement a multi-layer perceptron model to learn the complex relationship between the tool’s configuration (position and orientation) and the resulting surface deformation. Given a robot configuration and a local surface geometry around the contact center, the model can predict 3D displacement vectors of the pre-deform surfaces. We conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the model performance based on the various palpation angles between -40◦ and +40◦ and different tool penetration depths from 0.3 mm to 1.9 mm. The results show an average root mean square error of approximately 0.01 mm and an average maximum error less than 0.03 mm. This can demonstrate the feasibility of using a generic multi-layer perceptron model to learn the tool-tissue physics and shows potential applications of fast surface inference and deformation prediction during robot palpation.

### [An AI-Based Robot System for Automation Process of Slaughtering Ducks]()

The bloodletting in a duck slaughter process requires repetitive and dangerous labors. In order to automate the bloodletting process for duck slaughtering, we developed a machine vision-based bloodletting-slaughtering robot system. This system includes AI-based target recognition technology to detect the bloodletting area automatically and robot slaughtering system. A Mask-RCNN is utilized for object-background segmentation. Following the background segmentation, an integrated pipeline was implemented to find the target bloodletting point based on the estimated cervical vertebrae from the neck area of each duck. A training dataset of 1,789 RGB images was collected from duck slaughter process and the deep learning model for a duck neck-background segmentation was trained. In addition, classifying duck fainting and non-fainting is required for running a duck bloodletting process without system interruption. A lightweight CNN architecture using ONNX library was implemented for an application to edge devices in the workplace. The test results of automatically detecting the target bloodletting point showed high accuracy. A slaughtering robot system consists of a three-axis orthogonal robot, and the target bloodletting point is controlled in real time using position information transmitted from AI vision camera. The slaughtering task time using the robot system was 2.7 sec per duck. For application in slaughterhouses, five robots equipped with AI vision cameras will work in a set.

### [E-ARC: Experience-Based Subproblem Planning for Multi-Robot Motion Planning]()

Multi-robot systems enhance efficiency and productivity across various applications, from manufacturing to surveillance. While single-robot motion planning has improved by using databases of prior solutions, extending this approach to multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) presents challenges due to the increased complexity and diversity of tasks and configurations. Recent discrete methods have attempted to address this by focusing on relevant lower-dimensional subproblems, but they are inadequate for complex scenarios like those involving manipulator robots. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that constructs and utilizes databases of solutions for smaller sub-problems. By focusing on interactions between fewer robots, our method reduces the required database size compared to one that captures the full MRMP problem, enabling efficient handling of more complex scenarios. We validate our approach with experiments on mobile and manipulator robots, showing significant improvements in scalability and efficiency. Our method improves over its previous version with up to 40% faster planning and over existing experience-based methods with a 342× faster database construction and 2× faster planning. Our contributions include a rapidly constructed database for low-dimensional MRMP problems, a framework for applying these solutions to larger problems, and experimental validation with up to 32 mobile and 16 manipulator robots.

### [Understanding Spatial Relationships with Spherical Image Data for Manipulating Intelligent Robotic Wheelchairs]()

Mobility assistance is one of the major supports for elderly and differently abled communities. Since wheelchairs are primarily used in human-centered areas, there is a significant risk of accidents caused by the wheelchair itself and by other pedestrians in the vicinity. To address this serious issue, this work proposes utilizing spherical camera data for environmental perception. However, incorporating spherical data may introduce additional challenges to the topic. The use of omnidirectional cameras is currently very limited for navigational purposes and for scene understanding. However, the equirectangular transformation of spherical data can help understand the surrounding environment. Moreover, these images offer better insight into the direction of a pedestrian's motion and the distance. The study proposes an architecture to extract spatial connections between the wheelchair and nearby pedestrians by identifying visual features and tracking the subjects' movements relative to the wheelchair. This method can easily detect when a pedestrian is approaching a wheelchair or passing nearby without entering a danger zone, and the proposed architecture was able to achieve over 95% accuracy at an average processing frame rate of 15 FPS. Thus, this demonstrates the potential of spherical image data, which can be further enhanced to make intelligent decisions by electric wheelchairs and reduce cognitive load on the user to make their life more comfortable.

### [RAFFM: Robot Assisted Feeding for Finger-Foods with Multimodal Capabilities]()

A robotic feeding system for finger foods for individuals with spinal cord injuries. Our system integrates zero-shot object detection model, it uses Vision Language Model to recognize different food items and leverage large language models to personalize the feeding preferences. The platform is equipped with multimodal capabilities to process visual, auditory and proprioceptive inputs in realtime and respond with natural human like response and execute appropriate low-level robot actions. The system intelligently categorizes food items as sigle-bite or multi-bite to determine the most optimal grasp points. The robot also offers drink assistance using straw-delivery approach. For safe and comfortable bite transfer, our solution implements dynamic positioning that adapts to the user's height and facial orientation, using visual servoing with lip detection to ensure food is delivered only when the user's mouth is open. Additionally, we also provide a calibration method as an alternative to visual servoing, where the robot is set to admittance mode and manually moved to user's desired bite transfer pose. User studies with seven participants, including one with spinal cord injury, demonstrate excellent usability with SUS scores of 70 and NASA-TLX scores of 17, significantly outperforming the baseline average of 37±11.

The system integrates a robotic arm that positions an actively tracking OCT scan head over an extended workspace, minimizing the need for mechanical head stabilization and manual alignment. The UI architecture supports both operator-assisted and autonomous imaging modes, offering real-time feedback, intuitive interaction, and motion-adaptive visualization to facilitate effective human-robot collaboration. Future work includes a formal user study to evaluate the UI’s performance in terms of usability, task efficiency, and adaptability.

### [Equivariant Neural Inertial Odometry]()

Inertial odometry is essential for accurate localization in autonomous systems, particularly in environments where visual data is unreliable. However, noisy IMU measurements hinder accurate gravity compensation, which is critical for precise odometry. This paper presents a fully SO(3)-equivariant neural network framework for IMU-only odometry, designed to improve generalization across varying IMU mount orientations and mitigate challenges in gravity compensation. By representing IMU data in the Lie algebra and leveraging the symmetry properties of the rotation Lie group, the proposed method enforces 3D rotational symmetry within the feature space, leading to accurate state estimation in general unseen trajectories. Experimental results on diverse human motion datasets further demonstrate that our approach is more robust to gravitational perturbation on the IMU measurement, effectively reducing drift accumulation over the sequences. It remains robust under arbitrary IMU installation orientations, outperforming existing methods that rely on data augmentation or frame canonicalization. These improvements are achieved with a more compact network architecture, reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The results of this work enable reliable inertial position and orientation tracking in mobile robotics applications that have dynamic yaw direction motion with limited sensing capabilities.

### [Fully Integrated Sensor Suite for Delicate Manipulation]()

Parallel-jaw grippers can perform a wide range of complex, everyday tasks. However, they often rely on open-loop control without direct grasp feedback, leading to failures in delicate manipulation and fragile object handling. Tactile sensing can address this, but existing methods typically involve high integration complexity or compromise gripper compliance. There is a clear need for developing sensorized compliant grippers without sacrificing simplicity. We address this by embedding 3D-printed air channels within Fin-Ray fingers. These channels act as force and slip sensors, providing precise, real-time feedback while remaining simple to fabricate and integrate. Our system estimates grip force with a RMSE under 0.2 N and incorporates an analytical slip detector using second-order spectral features of tactile vibrations. We evaluate the system on an autonomous grasp-and-lift task using 31 objects spanning categories of fragile, slippery, and ordinary. Across 310 trials, our slip detector achieved 0.93 accuracy and 1.0 precision. Our system achieved 91.9% overall success and 98.6% on fragile objects. In contrast, a on-off strategy caused breakage of 84.6% of fragile objects, while a naive initial 0.25 N grip force yielded only 1.25% success on ordinary objects. These results demonstrate that our design combines accurate, real-time tactile feedback with the inherent compliance of the Fin-Ray structure, enabling reliable manipulation of delicate and diverse objects.

### [Key Capabilities of Autonomous Mobile Platforms for Maintenance and Monitoring in Manufacturing Environments]()

Quadruped robots are increasingly being deployed in manufacturing environments for autonomous inspection and manipulation tasks due to their unique advantage in mobility, such as navigating in tight spaces and stairs, which makes them ideal candidates for manufacturing plants. This paper investigates the potential of quadruped robots equipped with a 6-degree-of-freedom arm to perform complex tasks, including pick-and-place operations and identifying target objects in a cluttered environment. We conducted experiments focused on quadruped robots' ability to autonomously pick up, carry, and place a bucket in a structured workflow. We also investigated the use of computer vision and AprilTags for object detection and tracking. The quadruped demonstrated robust performance in both tasks, although challenges arise when handling heavier loads or finding target objects in cluttered environments. These findings make clear the capabilities and limitations of autonomous quadruped robots with manipulators in manufacturing settings.

### [Dual-Arm Teleoperated Robotic Microsurgery System with Real-Time Volumetric OCT Image Feedback]()

Microsurgical procedures demand exceptional precision and dexterity while posing significant challenges related to depth perception, fatigue, and hand tremor. Al- though intraoperative perception systems in surgical robotics typically provide real-time image feedback, they frequently lack volumetric or depth information. Moreover, teleoperated surgical robotic systems often require extensive training because their control mechanisms may not align with a surgeon’s intuitive practices, and standardizing these controls is further complicated by varying user preferences. To address these issues, we propose a dual-arm teleoperated robotic system that provides high-fidelity intraoperative volu- metric imaging for micro-scale tissue manipulation. The system integrates an optical coherence tomography (OCT) sensor for real-time 3D visualization and is operated through haptic input devices for precise manipulation. Surgeons can choose between multiple teleoperation frameworks to match their individual preferences and intuitions. We evaluate system performance through a precision positioning task and a vessel-following task in a retinal model, demonstrating average positioning errors of approximately 230 μm and 85 μm, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the fully integrated system in an eggshell mem- brane peeling task that simulates retinal membrane peeling.

### [Training Robot Swarms for Adaptive Foraging in Environments with Obstacles]()

We apply the NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) to train adaptive and efficient swarm robotic foraging behavior in unknown environments with random obstacles. By rewarding effective actions and penalizing inefficient ones, the system promotes coordination and obstacle avoidance, minimizing redundant exploration and outperforming traditional stochastic foraging algorithms. The optimization focuses on cumulative reward fitness, evaluated through simulations with three types of distributed resources, where swarm performance is analyzed in terms of foraging time efficiency and resource retrieval rates. Comparative experiments conducted across two swarm sizes demonstrate that the elaborated penalty-reward strategy enhances resource retrieval rates while reducing energy expenditure and obstacle avoidance, showcasing a significant improvement in foraging success and scalability over traditional foraging algorithms. In future work, we will leverage Federated Learning (FL) to build an efficient, distributed, scalable, and secure robot swarm tailored for foraging tasks.

### [Design Concept of Electromagnetic Tracking Method Based on a Robotic Arm for Pose Estimation]()

The merits of electromagnetic tracking that line of sight is not required, such as utilizing inside a body or behind an obstruction, makes electromagnetic tracking systems attractive for minimally invasive procedures. One critical issue is that electromagnetic tracking does not provide uniform accuracy throughout the tracking volume. This study proposes integrating an electromagnetic tracking system consisting of a magnetic field generator of five excitation coils, a sensing coil, and a robotic arm. The magnetic field generator is installed on the robotic arm’s end effector.	The pose of the electromagnetic tracking device placed on the robotic arm can be obtained from the calibration of the electromagnetic tracking system on the robotic arm. After calibration, the posture of the sensing coil in the robotic arm coordinates can be obtained and regarded as a closed-loop signal to control the robotic arm and place the excitation coil in a range suitable for sensing. The proposed method, which integrates an electromagnetic tracking system with a robotic arm, can increase the range of electromagnetic tracking and perform tracking in the accurate range.

### [Guarantees on Robot System Performance Using Stochastic Simulation Rollouts]()

We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for control policies executed on stochastic robotic systems. Given an open- or closed-loop policy and a finite set of trajectory rollouts under the policy, we bound the expected value, value-at-risk, and conditional-value-at-risk of the trajectory cost, and the probability of failure in a sparse cost setting. The bounds hold, with user-specified probability, for any policy synthesis technique and can be seen as a post-design safety certification. Generating the bounds only requires sampling simulation rollouts, without assumptions on the distribution or complexity of the underlying stochastic system. We adapt these bounds to also give a constraint satisfaction test to verify safety of the robot system. We provide a thorough analysis of the bound sensitivity to sim-to-real distribution shifts and provide results for constructing robust bounds that can tolerate some specified amount of distribution shift. Furthermore, we extend our method to apply when selecting the best policy from a set of candidates, requiring a multi-hypothesis correction. We show the statistical validity of our bounds in the Ant, Half-cheetah, and Swimmer MuJoCo environments and demonstrate our constraint satisfaction test with the Ant. Finally, using the 20 degree-of-freedom MuJoCo Shadow Hand, we show the necessity of the multi-hypothesis correction.

### [In-Pipe Navigation Development Environment and a Smooth Path Planning Method on Pipeline Surface]()

Autonomous in-pipe inspection robots can automatically navigate through complex pipeline networks and detect potential risks from corrosion and defects, demonstrating great potential for replacing costly manual inspections. However, there is no publicly available simulation environment where researchers can validate their in-pipe navigation algorithms as far as we know, and the navigation algorithms on constrained 3D pipe surface which is the critical software component are less discussed. Firstly, this paper proposes an open-source In-Pipe Navigation Development Environment. It contains various pipeline models, a magnetic wheel climbing robot model realized by the adhesion plugin, and baseline algorithms for navigation tasks. Secondly, a novel effective path planning method is introduced. Instead of planning based on surface structures, the proposed method plans based on pipeline axis and maps it into local path using the Frenet-Serret formula, thereby generating smooth, feasible, and efficient paths. Finally, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments in the proposed simulation and real-world environments. The results show the usability of the development environment, also robustness and efficiency of the proposed planning method.

### [Extended Friction Models for the Physics Simulation of Servo Actuators]()

Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.

### [Hierarchically Accelerated Coverage Path Planning for Redundant Manipulators]()

Many robotic applications, such as sanding, polishing, wiping and sensor scanning, require a manipulator to dexterously cover a surface using its end-effector. In this paper, we provide an efficient and effective coverage path planning approach that leverages a manipulator's redundancy and task tolerances to minimize costs in joint space. We formulate the problem as a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem and hierarchically streamline the graph size. Our strategy is to identify guide paths that roughly cover the surface and accelerate the computation by solving a sequence of smaller problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.

### [Decentralized Safe and Scalable Multi-Agent Control under Limited Actuation]()

To deploy safe and agile robots in cluttered environments, there is a need to develop fully decentralized controllers that guarantee safety, respect actuation limits, prevent deadlocks, and scale to thousands of agents. Current approaches fall short of meeting all these goals: optimization-based methods ensure safety but lack scalability, while learning-based methods scale but do not guarantee safety. We propose a novel algorithm to achieve safe and scalable control for multiple agents under limited actuation. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) learning a decentralized neural Integral Control Barrier function (neural ICBF) for scalable, input-constrained control, (ii) embedding a lightweight decentralized Model Predictive Control-based Integral Control Barrier Function (MPC-ICBF) into the neural network policy to ensure safety while maintaining scalability, and (iii) introducing a novel method to minimize deadlocks based on gradient-based optimization techniques from machine learning to address local minima in deadlocks. Our numerical simulations show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent control algorithms in terms of safety, input constraint satisfaction, and minimizing deadlocks. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization across scenarios with varying agent counts, scaling up to 1000 agents.

### [Multi-Agent Collective Construction of General Modular Structures]()

We present an algorithmic framework for a multi-robot modular assembly system. Motivated by the prospects of in-space assembly, we focus on the NASA Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) framework, in which multiple types of robots work together in a team to build large structures. Unlike with other multi-robot construction systems, the geometry of structures that ARMADAS robots can build is not limited to the class of histogram shapes. To address the intractability of path planning for a robot system with the exponentially growing number of dimensions, we present a decoupled planning approach, where the assembly and path planning is performed iteratively by one robot team at a time. We present a number of data structures which help us avoid collisions and deadlocks in the resulting robot schedule.

### [BPMP-Tracker: A Versatile Aerial Target Tracker Using Bernstein Polynomial Motion Primitives]()

This letter presents a versatile trajectory planning pipeline for aerial tracking. The proposed tracker is capable of handling various chasing settings such as complex unstructured environments, crowded dynamic obstacles and multiple-target following. Among the entire pipeline, we focus on developing a predictor for future target motion and a chasing trajectory planner. For rapid computation, we employ the sample-check-select strategy: modules sample a set of candidate movements, check multiple constraints, and then select the best trajectory. Also, we leverage the properties of Bernstein polynomials for quick calculations. The prediction module predicts the trajectories of the targets, which do not overlap with static and dynamic obstacles. Then the trajectory planner outputs a trajectory, ensuring various conditions such as occlusion and collision avoidance, the visibility of all targets within a camera image and dynamical limits. We fully test the proposed tracker in simulations and hardware experiments under challenging scenarios, including dual-target following, environments with dozens of dynamic obstacles and complex indoor and outdoor spaces.

### [PIN-SLAM: LiDAR SLAM Using a Point-Based Implicit Neural Representation for Achieving Global Map Consistency]()

Accurate and robust localization and mapping are essential components for most autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose a SLAM system for building globally consistent maps, called PIN-SLAM, that is based on an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map representation. Taking range measurements as input, our approach alternates between incremental learning of the local implicit signed distance field and the pose estimation given the current local map using a correspondence-free, point-to-implicit model registration. Our implicit map is based on sparse optimizable neural points, which are inherently elastic and deformable with the global pose adjustment when closing a loop. Loops are also detected using the neural point features. Extensive experiments validate that PIN-SLAM is robust to various environments and versatile to different range sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. PIN-SLAM achieves pose estimation accuracy better or on par with the state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry or SLAM systems and outperforms the recent neural implicit SLAM approaches while maintaining a more consistent, and highly compact implicit map that can be reconstructed as accurate and complete meshes. Finally, thanks to the voxel hashing for efficient neural points indexing and the fast implicit map-based registration without closest point association, PIN-SLAM can run at the sensor frame rate on a moderate GPU.

### [Data-Driven Batch Localization and SLAM Using Koopman Linearization]()

We present a framework for model-free batch localization and SLAM. We use lifting functions to map a control-affine system into a high-dimensional space, where both the process model and the measurement model are rendered bilinear. During training, we solve a least-squares problem using groundtruth data to compute the high-dimensional model matrices associated with the lifted system purely from data. At inference time, we solve for the unknown robot trajectory and landmarks through an optimization problem, where constraints are introduced to keep the solution on the manifold of the lifting functions. The problem is efficiently solved using a sequential quadratic program (SQP), where the complexity of an SQP iteration scales linearly with the number of timesteps. Our algorithms, called Reduced Constrained Koopman Linearization Localization (RCKL-Loc) and Reduced Constrained Koopman Linearization SLAM (RCKL-SLAM), are validated experimentally in simulation and on two datasets: one with anindoor mobile robot equipped with a laser rangefinder that measures range to cylindrical landmarks, and one on a golf cart equipped with RFID range sensors. We compare RCKL-

### [Certifiably Correct Range-Aided SLAM]()

We present the first algorithm to efficiently compute certifiably optimal solutions to range-aided simultaneous localization and mapping (RA-SLAM) problems. Robotic navigation systems increasingly incorporate point-to-point ranging sensors, leading to state estimation problems in the form of RA-SLAM. However, the RA-SLAM problem is significantly more difficult to solve than traditional pose-graph SLAM: ranging sensor models introduce non-convexity and single range measurements do not uniquely determine the transform between the involved sensors. As a result, RA-SLAM inference is sensitive to initial estimates yet lacks reliable initialization techniques. Our approach, certifiably correct RA-SLAM (CORA), leverages a novel quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation of RA-SLAM to relax the RA-SLAM problem to a semidefinite program (SDP). CORA solves the SDP efficiently using the Riemannian Staircase methodology; the SDP solution provides both (i) a lower bound on the RA-SLAM problem's optimal value, and (ii) an approximate solution of the RA-SLAM problem, which can be subsequently refined using local optimization. CORA applies to problems with arbitrary pose-pose, pose-landmark, and ranging measurements and, due to using convex relaxation, is insensitive to initialization. We evaluate CORA on several real-world problems. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, CORA is able to obtain high-quality solutions on all problems despite being initialized with random values. Additionally, we study the tightness of the SDP relaxation with respect to important problem parameters: the number of (i) robots, (ii) landmarks, and (iii) range measurements. These experiments demonstrate that the SDP relaxation is often tight and reveal relationships between graph connectivity and the tightness of the SDP relaxation.

### [DiTer++: Diverse Terrain and Multi-Modal Dataset for Multi-Robot SLAM in Multi-Session Environments]()

We encounter large-scale environments where both structured and unstructured spaces coexist, such as on campuses. In this environment, lighting conditions and dynamic objects change constantly. To tackle the challenges of largescale mapping under such conditions, we introduce DiTer++, a diverse terrain and multi-modal dataset designed for multirobot SLAM in multi-session environments. According to our datasets’ scenarios, Agent-A and Agent-B scan the area designated for efficient large-scale mapping day and night, respectively. Also, we utilize legged robots for terrain-agnostic traversing. To generate the ground-truth of each robot, we first build the survey-grade prior map. Then, we remove the dynamic objects and outliers from the prior map and extract the trajectory through scan-to-map matching. Our dataset and supplement materials are available at https://github.com/sparolab/DiTer-plusplus/.

### [CELLmap: Enhancing LiDAR SLAM through Elastic and Lightweight Spherical Map Representation]()

SLAM is a fundamental capability of unmanned systems, with LiDAR-based SLAM gaining widespread adop- tion due to its high precision. Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. How- ever, there are still several challenges when dealing with large- scale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional regis- tration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.

### [A Benchmark Dataset for Collaborative SLAM in Service Environments]()

We introduce a new multi-modal collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM) dataset for multiple service robots in various indoor service environments, called C-SLAM dataset in Service Environments (CSE). We use the NVIDIA Isaac Sim to generate data in various indoor service environments with the challenges that may occur in real-world service environments. By using the simulator, we can provide accurate and precisely time-synchronized sensor data, such as stereo RGB, stereo depth, IMU, and ground truth poses. We configure three common indoor service environments (Hospital, Office, and Warehouse), each of which includes various dynamic objects that perform motions suitable to each environment. In addition, we drive the three robots to mimic the actions of real service robots. Through these factors, we generate a realistic C-SLAM dataset for multiple service robots. We demonstrate our CSE dataset by evaluating diverse state-of-the-art single-robot SLAM and multi-robot SLAM methods. Our dataset will be available at https://github.com/vision3d-lab/CSE_Dataset.

### [A Consistent Parallel Estimation Framework for Visual-Inertial SLAM]()

In this article, we revisit the optimal fusion of visual and inertial information from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit and propose a novel parallel visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) estimation framework in favor of the multithread computation on a single CPU. We start modeling the SLAM problem with a Bayesian batch estimator, and then split it into two submodules, localization and mapping, of different scales and processing rates, however, can thus run concurrently. The estimation consistency is taken into account in decoupling the two submodules so that when loop closure occurs the localization accuracy can seamlessly benefit from the mapping result via online global optimization, which distinguishes our solution from the others. To this end, we design the corresponding front-end and back-end to consistently solve localization and mapping in parallel, especially the hybrid robocentric and world-centric formulations are used for modeling the respective problems. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both the synthetic data generated for Monte-Carlo simulations and diverse real datasets acquired in highly-dynamic, long-term, and large-scale SLAM scenarios. Simulation results validate the significantly improved consistency and accuracy by applying our method. Experimental results show the better (competitive at least) performance against a state-of-the-art method, while being capable of processing a huge amount of measurements in building large-scale maps without blocking the high-accuracy real-time localization outputs.

### [Depth-Based Efficient PnP: A Rapid and Accurate Method for Camera Pose Estimation]()

This paper presents a novel approach, DEPnP (Depth-based Efficient PnP), addressing the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem crucial in vision-based navigation and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in robotics and automation, which estimates the pose of a calibrated camera by observing the 2D projections of known 3D points onto the camera image plane. The method employs eight variables to control the depth of control points and orientation of camera, formulating camera pose estimation as an optimization task. By optimizing these variables utilizing mean-subtracted rotation equations, rapid and accurate camera pose estimation is achieved. Notably, the careful selection of variables and objective function simplifies the computation of the Jacobian matrix, ensuring computational efficiency. DEPnP demonstrates robustness against noise and inlier disturbances, consistently delivering accurate camera pose estimation. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness and accuracy of DEPnP, positioning it as a competitive solution for real-time applications requiring precise camera pose estimation in robotics and automation.

### [Kalman-Filter-Based Pose Estimation of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots Using Cable-Length Measurements with Colored Noise]()

This paper introduces a cable-length-based extended Kalman filter (L-EKF) framework to estimate the end-effector pose of a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR). The L-EKF fuses end-effector accelerometer and rate gyroscope measurements with cable-length measurements. The main contribution compared to prior CDPR pose estimation EKF methods is that the L-EKF framework does not require an iterative forward kinematics algorithm to be solved each time step, reducing the computation time of the EKF. Moreover, the L-EKF is amenable to the inclusion of colored measurement noise, which provides a more realistic quantification of the kinematic uncertainty present in the cable-length measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the L-EKF is computationally more efficient than previous forward-kinematics-based EKF methods, as well as the moderate improvement in pose estimation provided by the colored noise model.

### [A Unified End-To-End Network for Category-Level and Instance-Level Object Pose Estimation from RGB Images]()

Accurately estimating the 6-DoF pose of objects is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and robotics. While category-level pose estimation based on RGBD data has achieved good performance in recent years, estimating poses solely from RGB images remains a significant challenge. Existing RGB-based category-level methods primarily focus on recovering object point clouds from RGB images, and pose prediction is not performed end-to-end by a network. This paper presents a Category-level and Instance-level Pose Estimation Network (CIPE), which models pose estimation as a set prediction problem and enables direct pose regression from RGB images. To further enhance the network's ability to learn object poses, first, a novel learnable rotation representation that redefines rotation learning within Euclidean space is introduced to facilitate rotation regression. Additionally, we propose a prior-query fusion strategy that utilizes a pre-trained point cloud feature extraction network to integrate categorical object features with bounding boxes, thereby improving the incorporation of category information. Experimental results demonstrate that CIPE significantly outperforms existing RGB-based methods on both category-level and instance-level datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/jialeren/CIPE.

### [MonoLDP: LED Assisted Indoor Mobile Bot Monocular Depth Prediction and Pose Estimation System]()

Multi-robot clusters are increasingly deployed in indoor environments, where effective communication and 3D perception are critical for coordinated operations. Monocular cameras, known for their lightweight design, cost-effectiveness, and versatility, present a promising solution for these tasks. However, relying solely on monocular cameras for comprehensive perception and communication presents significant challenges. To address this, we introduce MonoLDP, a novel system that leverages monocular cameras for depth estimation, mutual pose estimation, and visible light communication in indoor environments, providing an integrated framework to overcome these limitations. MonoLDP features a two-stage network: (1) a depth estimation module that infers depth from monocular images, and (2) a depth-guided 3D object recognition network for agent-relative localization and pose estimation. We created a custom dataset to validate the accuracy of MonoLDP. On our indoor dataset, MonoLDP outperforms the baseline by 43.39% in 3D detection and 42.39% in bird’s-eye view detection, with an average localization error of 0.104m and an orientation error of 1.66 degrees. Moreover, the depth estimation network demonstrates excellent performance on the NYU v2 dataset. Additionally, the system achieves a communication rate of 1.2 Kbps with a bit error rate below 10^(-2) at a distance of up to 4 meters using LED arrays. Our code will be released at https://github.com/RavenLiang1005/MonoLDP.git.

### [LCSPose: Efficient, Accurate and Scalable Markerless 6-DoF Pose Estimation of a Quay Crane Spreader Based on LiDAR and Camera]()

Accurate Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation of Ship-To-Shore (STS) quay crane spreaders is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient container handling in port automation. However, existing pose estimation techniques face significant challenges, as camera-based systems either rely on markers, which are prone to damage, or struggle with depth estimation inaccuracies. Additionally, 3D sensor-based approaches, particularly point cloud registration (PCR), face challenges such as initial pose errors, high-latency inference, and difficulties in object identification based purely on geometric features. To address these limitations, we propose LCSPose, a LiDAR-camera fusion-based 6-DoF pose estimation method that is marker-free, accurate, efficient, and scalable. Our approach integrates three key modules: (1) a semantic-geometric segmentation module for spreader segmentation and outlier removal, (2) a spatial consistency template sampling module based on Spatial Consistency Score (SC-Score) for reliable template selection across varying distances, and (3) a multi-view coarse-to-fine pose refinement module which incorporates multi-view PCA alignment for robust initial posture prior estimation and iterative pose refinement strategy for long-range registration. Our method demonstrates a 60% improvement in registration recall over state-of-the-art (SOTA) PCR methods, achieving up to 6 cm in translation error and 0.19 degrees in rotation error, while maintaining real-time processing at 20Hz.

### [ZeroBP: Learning Position-Aware Correspondence for Zero-Shot 6D Pose Estimation in Bin-Picking]()

Bin-picking is a practical and challenging robotic manipulation task, where accurate 6D pose estimation plays a pivotal role. The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that ZeroBP outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot pose estimation methods, achieving an improvement of 9.1% in average recall of correct poses.

### [Virtual Frame Rotation: A Novel Two-Stage Pose Estimation Scheme of Permanent Magnet Marker for Medical Applications]()

Permanent magnetic marker (PMM) has the potential to broaden the scope of medical robots by facilitating the localization of target points even in environments where vision-based methods cannot operate. However, conventional approaches rely on the accuracy of the modeling equations and are not adaptable to changes in the magnet's properties, which can occur due to factors like non-uniformity in the marker material or temperature fluctuations within the PMM. These constraints make it challenging to apply the PMM across diverse medical techniques. In this work, we introduce a novel two-stage PMM localization scheme, called Virtual Frame Rotation (VFR), designed to address this issue. VFR employs an approach that virtually rotates the observation frame of the hall sensors' output vector and checks the symmetry of the magnetic field in the rotated frame. This approach allows for robust pose estimation of the condition with variance in magnetic properties, as verified by comparing its localization performance with the conventional approach in the simulation and the real-world environments with temperature variance conditions. Based on these characteristics, VFR can expand the scope of medical applications that involve changes in the properties of magnetic markers, such as the in-body localization of magnetic macro particles for hyperthermia treatment.

### [Back-Stepping Experience Replay with Application to Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for a Soft Snake Robot]()

In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Back-stepping Experience Replay (BER), that is compatible with arbitrary off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. BER aims to enhance learning efficiency in systems with approximate reversibility, reducing the need for complex reward shaping. The method constructs reversed trajectories using back-stepping transitions to reach random or fixed targets. Interpretable as a bi-directional approach, BER addresses inaccuracies in back-stepping transitions through a purification of the replay experience during learning. Given the intricate nature of soft robots and their complex interactions with environments, we present an application of BER in a model-free RL approach for the locomotion and navigation of a soft snake robot, which is capable of serpentine motion enabled by anisotropic friction between the body and ground. In addition, a dynamic simulator is developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the BER algorithm, in which the robot demonstrates successful learning (reaching a 100% success rate) and adeptly reaches random targets, achieving an average speed 48% faster than that of the best baseline approach.

### [Continuous Convolution for Automated Measurement of Sperm Flagella]()

Quantifying sperm flagellar beating behavior (e.g., beating amplitude, frequency, and wavelength) plays a crucial role in biological research, clinical diagnostics, and the design of sperm-inspired microrobots. However, existing computational methods struggle to accurately and efficiently analyze the highly dynamic, complex, and fine structures of sperm flagella, especially when portions of the flagellum become invisible due to three-dimensional out-of-focus beating. This paper proposes an automated high-throughput tool for quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating. The core innovation is continuous convolution (CConv), which adaptively captures the irregular, time-varying patterns of sperm flagella while ensuring continuity in segmentation outputs, even in the presence of locally invisible regions caused by out-of-focus motion. CConv can be integrated into various neural network architectures as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating CConv consistently improves the accuracy and continuity of flagella segmentation across different networks. Furthermore, utilizing a curvature-based approach, we quantified key flagellar beating parameters, including length, amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. Applying the high-throughput tool on 1200 sperm revealed that sperm from fertile donors had significantly higher flagellar beating frequency than sperm from infertile patients. The proposed automated tool unlocks high-throughput, quantitative analysis of sperm flagellar beating, showing the potential for applications in reproductive biology and engineering research.

### [Adaptive Concertina Locomotion of a Robotic Snake through Narrow Uncertain Channels]()

The problem of mimicking the concertina locomotion mode of biological snakes through narrow channels of uncertain width, using a multi-link planar serpenoid robot, is considered. A novel algorithm for generating a reference trajectory that accurately reproduces this natural gait pattern is proposed and analysed for straight channels. A modification of this algorithm leverages feedback from the joints’ current and angular velocities to dynamically adjust the robot’s movements within channels of unknown and varying widths. Experiments through rugged artificial channels of varying width show remarkable ability of the programmed snake robot to negotiate such terrains with agility and reasonable speed.

### [Bio-Inspired Distributed Neural Locomotion Controller (D-NLC) for Robust Locomotion and Emergent Behaviors]()

With relatively fewer neurons than more complex life forms, insects are still capable of producing astonishing locomotive behaviors, such as traversing diverse habitats and making rapid gait adaptations after extreme injury or autotomy. Biologists attribute this to a chain of segmental neuron clusters (ganglia) within insect nervous systems, which act as distributed, self-organizing sensorimotor control units. Inspired by the neural structure of the Carausius morosus, the common stick insect, this research introduces the Distributed Neural Locomotion Controller (D-NLC), a modular control framework utilizing local proprioceptive feedback to modulate joint-level Central Pattern Generator (CPG) signals to produce emergent locomotive behaviors. We implemented this framework using a modular legged robot with distributed joint-level embedded computing units and assessed its performance and behavior under various experimental settings. Based on real-world experiments, we observe an overall 31.3% average increase in curvilinear motion performance under external (terrain) and internal (amputation) disturbances compared to a centralized predefined gait controller. This difference is statistically significant (P<<0.05) for larger perturbations but not for single-leg amputations. Experiments with perturbation-induced leg stance duration and leg-phase-difference analysis further validated our hypothesis regarding D-NLC's role in the robust perceptive locomotion and self-emergent gait adaptation against complex unforeseen perturbations. This proposed control framework does not require any numerical optimization or weight training processes, which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first bio-inspired neural controller deployed on a distributed embedded system.

### [AquaMILR+: Design of an Untethered Limbless Robot for Complex Aquatic Terrain Navigation]()

This paper presents AquaMILR+, an untethered limbless robot designed for agile navigation in complex aquatic environments. The robot features a bilateral actuation mechanism that models musculoskeletal actuation in many anguilliform swimming organisms which propagates a moving wave from head to tail allowing open fluid undulatory swimming. This actuation mechanism employs mechanical intelligence, enhancing the robot's maneuverability when interacting with obstacles. AquaMILR+ also includes a compact depth control system inspired by the swim bladder and lung structures of eels and sea snakes. The mechanism, driven by a syringe and telescoping leadscrew, enables depth and pitch control -- capabilities that are difficult for most anguilliform swimming robots to achieve. Additional structures, such as fins and a tail, further improve stability and propulsion efficiency. Our tests in both open water and indoor 2D and 3D heterogeneous aquatic environments highlight AquaMILR+'s capabilities and suggest a promising system for complex underwater tasks such as search and rescue and deep-sea exploration.

### [Adapting Gait Frequency for Posture-Regulating Humanoid Push-Recovery Via Hierarchical Model Predictive Control]()

Current humanoid push-recovery strategies often use whole-body motion, yet they tend to overlook posture regulation. For instance, in manipulation tasks, the upper body may need to stay upright and have minimal recovery displacement. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing humanoid push-recovery performance under unknown disturbances and regulating body posture by tailoring the recovery stepping strategy. We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach. We also demonstrate improved push-recovery performance and minimized body attitude change under 0.2 rad.

### [Robots with Attitude: Singularity-Free Quaternion-Based Model-Predictive Control for Agile Legged Robots]()

We present a model-predictive control (MPC) framework for legged robots that avoids the singularities associated with common three-parameter attitude representations like Euler angles during large-angle rotations. Our method parameterizes the robot's attitude with singularity-free unit quaternions and makes modifications to the iterative linear-quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm to deal with the resulting geometry. The derivation of our algorithm requires only elementary calculus and linear algebra, deliberately avoiding the abstraction and notation of Lie groups. We demonstrate the performance and computational efficiency of quaternion MPC in several experiments on quadruped and humanoid robots.

### [Online Nonlinear MPC for Multimodal Locomotion]()

Aerial humanoid robots can enhance the efficiency and safety of rescue operations in disaster scenarios. The control of such complex machines presents many challenges, for instance, the control of the different locomotion strategies and the stabilization of the transition maneuvers. In this article, we present an online nonlinear Model Predictive Controller and the relative prediction model to stabilize walking and flying trajectories. The controller uses a reduced model to generate feasible base link references, thrust profiles, and contact forces while dealing with different locomotion strategies and transition maneuvers. The control algorithm is tested in a simulated environment using our aerial humanoid robot iRonCub under the effect of external disturbances. The proposed control strategy demonstrates to effectively stabilize the desired trajectories while keeping the problem still treatable online.

### [Terrain-Aware Model Predictive Control of Heterogeneous Bipedal and Aerial Robot Coordination for Search and Rescue Tasks]()

Humanoid robots offer significant advantages for search and rescue tasks, thanks to their capability to traverse rough terrains and perform transportation tasks. In this study, we present a task and motion planning framework for search and rescue operations using a heterogeneous robot team composed of humanoids and aerial robots. We propose a terrain-aware Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that incorporates terrain elevation gradients learned using Gaussian processes (GP). This terrain-aware MPC generates safe navigation paths for the bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain while minimizing terrain slopes, and it directs the quadrotors to perform aerial search and mapping tasks. The rescue subjects' locations are estimated by a target belief GP, which is updated online during the map exploration. A high-level planner for task allocation is designed by encoding the navigation tasks using syntactically cosafe Linear Temporal Logic (scLTL), and a consensus-based algorithm is designed for task assignment of individual robots. We evaluate the efficacy of our planning framework in simulation in an uncertain environment with various terrains and random rescue subject placements.

### [Koopman Operator Based Linear Model Predictive Control for Quadruped Trotting]()

Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming (QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

### [Kinodynamic Model Predictive Control for Energy Efficient Locomotion of Legged Robots with Parallel Elasticity]()

In this paper, we introduce a kinodynamic model predictive control (MPC) framework that exploits unidirectional parallel springs (UPS) to improve the energy efficiency of dynamic legged robots. The proposed method employs a hierarchical control structure, where the solution of MPC with simplified dynamic models is used to warm-start the kinodynamic MPC, which accounts for nonlinear centroidal dynamics and kinematic constraints. The proposed approach enables energy efficient dynamic hopping on legged robots by using UPS to reduce peak motor torques and energy consumption during stance phases. Simulation results demonstrated a 38.8% reduction in the cost of transport (CoT) for a monoped robot equipped with UPS during high-speed hopping. Additionally, preliminary hardware experiments show a 14.8% reduction in energy consumption.

### [Dynamic Bipedal MPC with Foot-Level Obstacle Avoidance and Adjustable Step Timing]()

Collision-free planning is essential for bipedal robots operating within unstructured environments. This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and (2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as hardware experiments on Digit.

### [Enhancing Robotic Perception with Low-Cost Fast Active Vision Achieving Sub-Millimeter Accurate Marker-Based Pose Estimation]()

Robust perception of the environment is a critical challenge for robots, especially those that use mobile platforms or humanoid forms to perform manipulation tasks. Active vision, leveraging strategic camera movements and adaptive imaging parameters, holds great potential for addressing critical challenges such as achieving high accuracy in precise manipulation, ensuring low latency for rapid responsiveness, and overcoming occlusions and illumination variations in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel, cost-effective, and easily deployable active vision system designed to enhance visual perception for robotic applications. Integrated with a novel hybrid software setup, the system utilizes ArUco markers to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency performance, boasting sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy at 200 Hz with a latency of less than 15 ms. Additionally, a new measurement and evaluation procedure is presented, offering benchmarking for marker-based object detection systems that for the first time includes rotation measurements as well. The benchmarking results for the proposed system indicate that achieving the desired performance levels necessitates specialized active vision measurement strategies. For instance, to ensure high positional accuracy, the system needs precise object centering, while high rotational accuracy requires accounting for lateral or rotational offsets.

### [PhysPart: Physically Plausible Part Completion for Interactable Objects]()

Interactable objects are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recent advances in 3D generative models make it possible to automate the modeling of these objects, benefiting a range of applications from 3D printing to the creation of robot simulation environments. However, while significant progress has been made in modeling 3D shapes and appearances, modeling object physics, particularly for interactable objects, remains challenging due to the physical constraints imposed by inter-part motions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of physically plausible part completion for interactable objects, aiming to generate 3D parts that not only fit precisely into the object but also allow smooth part motions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based part generation model that utilizes geometric conditioning through classifier-free guidance and formulates physical constraints as a set of stability and mobility losses to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we demonstrate the generation of dependent parts, paving the way toward sequential part generation for objects with complex part-whole hierarchies. Experimentally, we introduce a new metric for measuring physical plausibility based on motion success rates. Our model outperforms existing baselines over shape and physical metrics, especially those that do not adequately model physical constraints. We also demonstrate our applications in 3D printing, robot manipulation, and sequential part generation, showing our strength in realistic tasks with the demand for high physical plausibility.

### [Generalizable Zero-Shot Object Pose Estimation for Bin-Picking]()

Abstract—Unordered grasping in industrial robotic manipulation requires precise six-degree-of-freedom (6D) pose estimation. However, existing methods often struggle with unknown objects and require retraining, limiting their practicality. Traditional 3D point-pair feature methods, while training-free, perform poorly with textured symmetric objects. We propose a generalizable approach for zero-shot 6D pose estimation without retraining. Our method consists of two steps: generating CAD-based templates through real-time rendering for coarse pose estimation, and refining poses using semantic point-pair features aligned with the camera viewpoint. We conducted experiments on seven core datasets from the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation (BOP) challenge, and the results are publicly available on the BOP website. Integration into a robotic grasping system further highlights its high precision and fast execution, making it idealfor applications such as bin-picking.

### [Visuo-Tactile Object Pose Estimation for a Multi-Finger Robot Hand with Low-Resolution In-Hand Tactile Sensing]()

Accurate 3D pose estimation of grasped objects is an important prerequisite for robots to perform assembly or in-hand manipulation tasks, but object occlusion by the robot's own hand greatly increases the difficulty of this perceptual task. Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.

### [Proactive Tactile Exploration for Object-Agnostic Shape Reconstruction from Minimal Visual Priors]()

The perception of an object’s surface is important for robotic applications enabling robust object manipulation. The level of accuracy in such a representation affects the outcome of the action planning, especially during tasks that require physical contact, e.g. grasping. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative method for 3D shape reconstruction consisting of two steps. At first, a mesh is fitted on data points acquired from the object’s surface, based on a single primitive template. Subsequently, the mesh is properly adjusted to adequately represent local deformities. Moreover, a novel proactive tactile exploration strategy aims at minimizing the total uncertainty with the least number of contacts, while reducing the risk of contact failure in case the estimated surface differs significantly from the real one. The performance of the methodology is evaluated both in 3D simulation and on a real setup.

### [Multi-Layer Feature Exchange Transformer for Multi-View 6D Object Pose Estimation in Robot Bin Picking]()

Accurate 6D object pose estimation is crucial in industrial automation, particularly in robotic bin picking, where objects are often textureless, reflective, and arranged in cluttered environments. Multi-view pose estimation methods offer significant advantages over single-view methods by providing more comprehensive information, effectively handling occlusions and lack of features, and resolving depth ambiguities. However, current multi-view methods often rely on late-stage information fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit complementary multi-view data. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance multi-view 6D pose estimation by introducing a Feature Exchange Transformer (FET) for early-stage feature fusion. This approach leverages self-attention and epipolar cross-attention mechanisms to enable multi-layer feature aggregation across views. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for an efficient feature exchange at multiple network layers. Our method, implemented on top of EpiSurfEmb, enhances the utilization of multi-view information, leading to significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging bin-picking scenarios.We evaluate our approach on the ROBI dataset, demonstrating that it outperforms both the baseline EpiSurfEmb and other state-of-the-art multi-view pose estimation methods

### [DRAGON: A Dialogue-Based Robot for Assistive Navigation with Visual Language Grounding]()

Persons with visual impairments (PwVI) have difficulties understanding and navigating spaces around them. Current wayfinding technologies either focus solely on navigation or provide limited communication about the environment. Motivated by recent advances in visual-language grounding and semantic navigation, we propose DRAGON, a guiding robot powered by a dialogue system and the ability to associate the environment with natural language. By understanding the commands from the user, DRAGON is able to guide the user to the desired landmarks on the map, describe the environment, and answer questions from visual observations. Through effective utilization of dialogue, the robot can ground the user's free-form descriptions to landmarks in the environment, and give the user semantic information through spoken language. We conduct a user study with blindfolded participants in an everyday indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that DRAGON is able to communicate with the user smoothly, provide a good guiding experience, and connect users with their surrounding environment in an intuitive manner.

### [Space-Aware Instruction Tuning: Dataset and Benchmark for Guide Dog Robots Assisting the Visually Impaired]()

Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM.

### [FitnessAgent: A Unified Agent Framework for Open-Set and Personalized Fitness Evaluation]()

Robotic systems face challenges in performing open-set and personalized fitness evaluations, especially when adapting to new exercises and individual user needs. This paper introduces FitnessAgent, a unified agent framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional systems that rely on pre-trained neural networks or fixed rule-based criteria, FitnessAgent can assess any exercise without prior training, adapting evaluation metrics based on expert knowledge and user-specific requirements. The system breaks down fitness evaluation tasks into combinations of metrics, each calculated using measurable operators such as angles, distances, and positions. By leveraging a set of primitive, exercise-agnostic operators, a large language model (LLM)-based planner dynamically selects and combines these operators for each task. The open-set capability of FitnessAgent is validated through experiments on both the widely-used Functional Movement Screen dataset and a newly collected isometric pose dataset. Results highlight the system's flexibility in handling new movements and its ability to adapt to personalized evaluation criteria without the need for code or algorithm modifications. FitnessAgent offers a scalable and personalized solution for fitness evaluation, making it well-suited for robotic applications that require adaptability to diverse user needs.

### [A Reinforcement Learning-Based Social Robot for Personalized Learning in Children with Autism]()

This work hypothesizes that a social robot that uses reinforcement learning can effectively adapt to individual differences in teaching imitation skills (e.g., facial expressions) to children with autism spectrum disorder. We developed an active learning method based on reinforcement learning to personalize human-robot interaction sessions based on each child's imitation performance and preference. We evaluated this method with five children with autism spectrum disorder, and the results demonstrated varying responses to different methods of presenting facial expressions to teach imitation skills. We found that the robot consistently promoted increased shared attention, including visual contact and physical proximity during imitation tasks. This suggests that adaptive human-robot interactions can cater to the unique needs of children with autism, offering a promising avenue for personalized intervention. Additionally, we discuss observed qualitative insights from our study and considerations for robot behavior mitigation strategies to sustain engagement.

### [Comparison of User Interface Paradigms for Assistive Robotic Manipulators]()

This paper presents the results of a within-subjects user study with 27 participants over the age of 60, comparing the use of two different user interfaces for an assistive robot scooter. The graphical user interface (GUI) shows a representation of the environment on a 10-inch touchscreen. The tangible user interface (TUI) consists of a joystick, a box of buttons, and a projector -- designed to keep the user's attention in the real world. Trends suggest that the TUI could help mitigate difficulty caused by highly cluttered environments, as well as differences in individual spatial reasoning ability, but additional studies are needed.

### [VQA-Driven Event Maps for Assistive Navigation for People with Low Vision in Urban Environments]()

We introduce a novel framework for assistive urban navigation for individuals with low vision. Utilizing a smart glasses platform developed by Biel Glasses, which provide a continuous stream of stereo images and GPS fixes, we generate an textit{Event Map} based on key semantic elements extracted by carefully prompted visual question-answering (VQA) models. For individuals with blurry or reduced fields of vision (low vision), traversing city streets poses a variety of challenges; they may struggle to perceive construction work, potholes, crowded sidewalks, and other ambiguous obstacles obstructing their paths. Some tasks, such as distinguishing traffic light signals, are nigh impossible without assistance from a companion or city infrastructure aimed towards accessibility. Although the majority of these problems may be solved with individually tailored traditional computer vision algorithms, developing and running a suite of these algorithms is challenging and resource demanding. Therefore, our proposed solution capitalizes on a single underlying implementation that need only be extended by adding queries. We validate our approach using a custom dataset of over 1,300 annotated images from various locations around Barcelona, reporting performance across different urban navigation tasks. We demonstrate the performance of the end to end system on a run of data collected by the Biel Glasses platform.

### [A Robust High-Strength Multi-Surface Rapid UV-Curable Payload Installation System for Generic Multirotors Via Impact Delivery]()

This letter details the design and development of a novel 3D-printed, lightweight and rapid-curing automated payload installation system for aerial robots, using a 3D printed resin-filled adhesive carrier tile (ACT). Its structure is designed to fracture and disperse ultraviolet (UV) curable resin on impact, delivered with a lightweight spring-driven impactor that rams the tile against a target surface. The dispersed resin is then cured with UV light. Shear-testing experiments with 40×40 mm ACTs across common building materials, surface conditions and roughness demonstrate loading exceeding 900N only after 10 seconds of curing, showcasing the strength, robustness and speed of the proposed system. Automated payload installation experiments show potential for applications requiring strong and permanent bonds to wall structures, such as sensor payloads or tether points within urban environments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work employing wet UV adhesives for payload installation via multirotors.

### [Multi-View Stereo with Geometric Encoding for Dense Scene Reconstruction]()

Multi-view stereo (MVS) implicitly encodes photometric and geometric cues into the cost volume for multi-view correspondence matching, transferring insufficient geometric cues essential to depth estimation and reconstruction. This paper proposes GE-MVS, a novel multi-view stereo network with geometric encoding for more accurate and complete depth estimation and point cloud reconstruction. First, the cross-view adaptive cost volume aggregation module is proposed to strengthen multi-view geometric cues encoding during cost volume construction. Then, the depth consistency optimization is performed in the 3D point space during learning by invoking ground-truth depth cues from adjacent views. Finally, the surface normal geometries are explicitly encoded to refine the sampled depth hypotheses to be consistent in the local neighbor regions. Extensive experiments on the standard MVS benchmarks including DTU, Tanks and Temples, and BlendedMVS demonstrate the state-of-the-art depth estimation and point cloud reconstruction performance of GE-MVS. The GE-MVS is further deployed in real-world experiments for UAV-based large-scale reconstruction, where our method outperforms the prevalent industrial reconstruction solutions concerning reconstruction efficiency and efficacy.

### [MicroASV: An Affordable 3D-Printed Centimeter-Scale Autonomous Surface Vehicle]()

This paper introduces the design, fabrication, and autonomous control of MicroASV, a low-cost, centimeter-scale autonomous surface Vehicle (ASV). MicroASV has a square footprint with a side length of 85 mm. Its propulsion system consists of four custom water jets arranged in a “Diamond”- shaped actuator configuration, powered by magnetically coupled brushless motors. This setup allows for complete 2D mobility, enabling forward and backward motion, lateral translation, and in-place rotation. The MicroASV is built using commercially available motors and 3D-printed components, creating a modular, appendage-free structure that is simple to assemble. An onboard camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) are integrated to enable real-time localization, with position and heading controllers developed to provide autonomous feedback control. Preliminary experiments validate the platform’s effectiveness in motion, sensing, and control, establishing MicroASV as a valuable tool for studying centimeter-scale ASV control, both individually and in collective swarm operations.

### [Airflow Source Seeking on Small Quadrotors Using a Single Flow Sensor]()

As environmental disasters happen more frequently and severely, seeking the source of pollutants or harmful particulates using plume tracking becomes even more important. Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small drones. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors (<100 g). We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.

### [Air-FAR: Fast and Adaptable Routing for Aerial Navigation in Large-Scale Complex Unknown Environments]()

This paper presents a novel method for real-time 3D navigation in large-scale, complex environments using a hierarchical 3D visibility graph (V-graph). The proposed algorithm addresses the computational challenges of V-graph construction and shortest path search on the graph simulta- neously. By introducing hierarchical 3D V-graph construction with heuristic visibility update, the 3D V-graph is constructed in O(K ·n2logn) time, which guarantees real-time performance. The proposed iterative divide-and-conquer path search method can achieve near-optimal path solutions within the constraints of real-time operations. The algorithm ensures efficient 3D V- graph construction and path search. Extensive simulated and real-world environments validated that our algorithm reduces the travel time by 42%, achieves up to 24.8% higher trajectory efficiency, and runs faster than most benchmarks by orders of magnitude in complex environments. The code and developed simulator have been open-sourced to facilitate future research.

### [Multi-Agent Visual-Inertial Localization for Integrated Aerial Systems with Loose Fusion of Odometry and Kinematics]()

Reliably and efficiently estimating the relative pose and global localization of robots in a common reference for Integrated Aerial Platforms (IAPs) is a challenging problem. Unlike unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, where the agent individual is able to move freely, IAPs connect UAV agents with mechanical joints, such as spherical joints, and form a rigid central platform, limiting the degree of freedom (DOF) of agents. Traditional methods, which rely on forming loop closures, object detection, or range sensors, suffer from degeneration or inefficiency due to the restricted relative motion between agents. In this paper, we present a centralized multi-agent localization system that fuses the internal kinematic constraints of IAPs and odometry measurements, using only visual-inertial suits for ego-motion estimation for agents and an additional 9-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the central platform for posture estimation. A general formulation for kinematic constraints is derived without requiring knowledge about detailed kinematic parameters. A sliding-window optimization-based state estimator is constructed to estimate the relative transformation between agents. Our proposed approach is validated in our collected dataset. The results show that the proposed method reduces the global localization drift by 27.15% and relative localization error by 53.4% in the translation part and 36.99% in the rotation part compared to the baseline.

### [Multi Map Visual Localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]()

Localization has long been an essential area of research within robotics. The popularity of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to solve different tasks has increased and is expected to continue. Developing a robust complementary system to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) used today has been researched, and visual localization using cameras and satellite images is a popular choice to use. One of the challenges with using satellite images is that different images over the same area can impact the system’s performance.This article proposes a novel approach called Multi Map Visual Localization (MMVL), a method to use multiple satellite images simultaneously, which is combined using a weighted average of probability maps. The proposal uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a caching strategy together with Monto Carlo Localization (MCL). MMVL achieves excellent robustness compared to other approaches and manages to estimate the correct location on all test flights. At the same time, using multiple satellite images does not significantly impact accuracy and computation time.

### [Task and Motion Planning for Execution in the Real]()

Task and motion planning represents a powerful set of hybrid planning methods that combine reasoning over discrete task domains and continuous motion generation. Traditional reasoning necessitates task domain models and enough information to ground actions to motion planning queries. Gaps in this knowledge often arise from sources like occlusion or imprecise modeling. This work generates task and motion plans that include actions cannot be fully grounded at planning time. During execution, such an action is handled by a provided human-designed or learned closed-loop behavior. Execution combines offline planned motions and online behaviors till reaching the task goal. Failures of behaviors are fed back as constraints to find new plans. Forty real-robot trials and motivating demonstrations are performed to evaluate the proposed framework and compare against state-of-the-art. Results show faster execution time, less number of actions, and more success in problems where diverse gaps arise. The experiment data is shared for researchers to simulate these settings. The work shows promise in expanding the applicable class of realistic partially grounded problems that robots can address.

### [Automated Planning Domain Inference for Task and Motion Planning]()

Task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address long and complex planning problems by integrating high-level task planners with low-level motion planners. However, existing TAMP methods rely heavily on the manual design of planning domains that specify the preconditions and postconditions of all high-level actions. This paper proposes a method to automate planning domain inference from a handful of test-time trajectory demonstrations, reducing the reliance on human design. Our approach incorporates a deep learning-based estimator that predicts the appropriate components of a domain for a new task and a search algorithm that refines this prediction, reducing the size and ensuring the utility of the inferred domain. Our method can generate new domains from minimal demonstrations at test time, enabling robots to handle complex tasks more efficiently. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms behavior cloning baselines, which directly imitate planner behavior, in terms of planning performance and generalization across a variety of tasks. Additionally, our method reduces computational costs and data amount requirements at test time for inferring new planning domains.

### [Shadow Program Inversion with Differentiable Planning: A Framework for Unified Robot Program Parameter and Trajectory Optimization]()

This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints. To that end, we introduce DGPMP2-ND, a differentiable collision-free motion planner for serial N-DoF kinematics, and integrate it into an iterative, gradient-based optimization approach for generic, parameterized robot program representations. SPI-DP allows first-order optimization of planned trajectories and program parameters with respect to objectives such as cycle time or smoothness subject to e.g. collision constraints, while enabling humans to understand, modify or even certify the optimized programs. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on two practical household and industrial applications.

### [AlignBot: Aligning VLM-Powered Customized Task Planning with User Reminders through Fine-Tuning for Household Robots]()

This paper presents AlignBot, a novel framework designed to optimize VLM-powered customized task planning for household robots by effectively aligning with user reminders. In domestic settings, aligning task planning with user reminders poses significant challenges due to the limited quantity, diversity, and multimodal nature of the reminders. To address these challenges, AlignBot employs a fine-tuned LLaVA-7B model, functioning as an adapter for GPT-4o. This adapter model internalizes diverse forms of user reminders-such as personalized preferences, corrective guidance, and contextual assistance-into structured that prompt GPT-4o in generating customized task plans. Additionally, AlignBot integrates a dynamic retrieval mechanism that selects task-relevant historical successes as prompts for GPT-4o, further enhancing task planning accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of AlignBot, experiments are conducted in real-world household environments, which are constructed within the laboratory to replicate typical household settings. A multimodal dataset with over 1,500 entries derived from volunteer reminders is used for training and evaluation. The results demonstrate that AlignBot significantly improves customized task planning, outperforming existing LLM- and VLM-powered planners by interpreting and aligning with user reminders, achieving 86.8% success rate compared to the vanilla GPT-4o baseline at 21.6%, reflecting a 65% improvement and over four times greater effectiveness. Supplementary materials are available at: https://yding25.com/AlignBot/

### [Curiosity-Driven Imagination: Discovering Plan Operators and Learning Associated Policies for Open-World Adaptation]()

Adapting quickly to dynamic, uncertain environments—often called ``open worlds"—remains a major challenge in robotics. Traditional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches struggle to cope with unforeseen changes, are data-inefficient when adapting, and do not leverage world models during learning. We address this issue with a hybrid planning and learning system that integrates two models: a low-level neural network-based model that learns stochastic transitions and drives exploration via an Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and a high-level symbolic planning model that captures abstract transitions using operators, enabling the agent to plan in an ``imaginary" space and generate reward machines. Our evaluation in a robotic manipulation domain with sequential novelty injections demonstrates that our approach converges faster and outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid methods.

### [Optimization-Based Task and Motion Planning under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications Using Logic Network Flow]()

This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework, named "Logic Network Flow", to integrate signal temporal logic (STL) specifications into efficient mixed-binary linear programmings. In this framework, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of the network flow, instead of as constraints between the nodes as in the traditional Logic Tree formulation. Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems. As the problem size scales up, our method still discovers better lower and upper bounds by exploring fewer number of nodes during the branches.

### [Integrating Active Sensing and Rearrangement Planning for Efficient Object Retrieval from Unknown, Confined, Cluttered Environments]()

Retrieving target objects from unknown, confined spaces remains a challenging task that requires integrated, task-driven active sensing and rearrangement planning. Previous approaches have independently addressed active sensing and rearrangement planning, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a new, integrated heuristic-based active sensing and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based retrieval planning approach. These components provide feedback to one another to actively sense critical, unobserved areas suitable for the retrieval planner to plan a sequence for relocating path-blocking obstacles and a collision-free trajectory for retrieving the target object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a robot arm equipped with an in-hand camera in both simulated and real-world confined, cluttered scenarios. Our framework is compared against various state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin in terms of the success rate, the object rearrangement planning time consumption and the number of planning trials before successfully retrieving the target.

### [A Cooperative Bearing-Rate Approach for Observability-Enhanced Target Motion Estimation]()

Vision-based target motion estimation is a fundamental problem in many robotic tasks. The existing methods have the limitation of low observability and, hence, face challenges in tracking highly maneuverable targets. Motivated by the aerial target pursuit task where a target may maneuver in 3D space, this paper studies how to further enhance observability by incorporating the emph{bearing rate} information that has not been well explored in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new cooperative estimator called STT-R (Spatial-Temporal Triangulation with bearing Rate), which is designed under the framework of distributed recursive least squares. This theoretical result is further verified by numerical simulation and real-world experiments. It is shown that the proposed STT-R algorithm can effectively generate more accurate estimations and effectively reduce the lag in velocity estimation, enabling tracking of more maneuverable targets.

### [Overlapping Free: Anchorless UWB-Assisted Relative Pose Estimation for Multi-Robot Systems]()

Accurate Relative Pose Estimation (RPE) is critical for effective collaboration of multi-robot systems. Traditional methods using cameras or LiDARs heavily rely on overlapping Fields of View (FoV) between robots, which is highly demanding in practical applications and may hinder collaboration efficiency. To accommodate this issue, we propose Anchorless UWB-Assisted Relative Pose Estimation (AURPE), a novel approach that leverages ultra-wideband (UWB) technology in an anchorless setup to achieve multi-robot RPE without requiring overlapping FoVs or external infrastructure. AURPE first estimates the initial relative poses between robots using inter-robot UWB ranging combined with a Bayesian framework and constrained optimization. During robot operation, AURPE continuously refines the relative poses by integrating UWB measurements with LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and employs a consensus voting mechanism to identify the most reliable pose estimates. Additionally, a pose graph-based back-end optimization is incorporated to enhance the accuracy of both initial and real-time relative pose. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that AURPE achieves accurate RPE even in non-overlapping scenarios where traditional methods fail. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud registration methods, AURPE shows superior performance in both accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance cooperative tasks in multi-robot systems operating in complex environments.

### [Maintaining Strong R-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks Using Control Barrier Functions]()

In leader-follower consensus, strong r-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.

### [Online Waypoint Recognition of Controlled Agents in Uncertain Environments]()

For multi-robot teams with limited communication, the ability to rapidly recognize the intention of a teammate via its exhibited behavior is key to achieving effective collaboration. While current research on plan and goal recognition provide powerful tools, most of them rely on a high-level abstraction of the environment and of its dynamics. We propose online waypoint recognition (OWR) that incorporates knowledge about the dynamic models into the analysis of the observed agent behavior. Our algorithm takes the form of a Kalman filter and performs recognition of the agent's intended waypoint at high frequency. The approach is robust to uncertainties in dynamics and observations. Moreover, it does not require the agent to reach the next waypoint to perform recognition, which saves valuable time. Our empirical evaluation shows the ability of our proposed algorithm to expedite recognition of both simulated and real-world mobile robots.

### [MARF: Cooperative Multi-Agent Path Finding with Reinforcement Learning and Frenet Lattice in Dynamic Environments]()

Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) in dynamic and complex environments is a highly challenging task. Recent research has often focused on the scalability of the number of robots or the complexity of the environment. Usually, they disregard the robots' physical models or use a differential drive robot. However, this approach fails to adequately capture the kinematic and dynamic constraints of real-world vehicles, particularly those equipped with Ackermann steering in warehousing applications. This paper presents a novel MAPF algorithm that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a lattice planner. RL provides strong generalization capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. By incorporating lattice planner trajectories into the action space of the RL framework, agents are capable of generating smooth and feasible paths that respect the kinematic and dynamic constraints. In addition, we adopt a decentralized training and execution framework, where a network of shared value functions enables efficient cooperation among agents during decision-making. Simulation results and real-world experiments in different scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of success rate, average speed, extra distance of trajectory, and computing time.

### [Robust Self-Reconfiguration for Fault-Tolerant Control of Modular Aerial Robot Systems]()

Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units assembled into a single, integrated rigid flying platform. With inherent redundancy, MARS can self-reconfigure into different configurations to mitigate rotor or unit failures and maintain stable flight. However, existing works on MARS self-reconfiguration often overlook the practical controllability of intermediate structures formed during the reassembly process, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we address this gap by considering the control-constrained dynamic model of MARS and proposing a robust and efficient self-reconstruction algorithm that maximizes the controllability margin at each intermediate stage. Specifically, we develop algorithms to compute optimal, controllable disassembly and assembly sequences, enabling robust self-reconfiguration. Finally, we validate our method in several challenging fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both controllability and trajectory tracking while reducing the number of assembly steps. The videos and source code of this work are available at https://github.com/RuiHuangNUS/MARS-Reconfig/

### [Where Are You? Unscented Particle Filter for Single Range Relative Pose Estimation in Unobservable Motion Using UWB and VIO]()

Real-time relative pose (RP) estimation is a corner- stone for effective multi-agent collaboration. When conventional global positioning infrastructure such as GPS is unavailable, the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology on each agent provides a practical means to measure inter-agent range, eliminating the need for external hardware installations, due to UWB’s precise range measurements and robust communi- cation capabilities. However, when only a single UWB device per agent is used, the relative pose between the agents can be unobservable, resulting in a complex solution space with multiple possible RPs. In this paper, a novel method is proposed based on an Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) that fuses single UWB ranges with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed decentralized method solves the multi-modal solution in 3D (4-DoF) for the RP when it is unobservable. Moreover, a pseudo-state is introduced to correct for rotational drift of the agents. Through simulations and experiments involving two robots, the proposed solution was shown to be competitive, but less computationally expensive. Additionally, the proposed solution provides all possible relative poses from the first measurement. The code and link to the video are available https://github.com/y2d2/UPF_RPE.

### [Asynchronous Blob Tracker for Event Cameras]()

Event-based cameras are popular for tracking fast-moving objects due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for tracking event blobs using raw events asynchronously in real time. We introduce the concept of an event blob as a spatio-temporal likelihood of event occurrence where the conditional spatial likelihood is blob-like. Many real-world objects such as car headlights or any quickly moving foreground objects generate event blob data. The proposed algorithm uses a nearest neighbour classifier with a dynamic threshold criteria for data association coupled with an extended Kalman filter to track the event blob state. Our algorithm achieves highly accurate blob tracking, velocity estimation, and shape estimation even under challenging lighting conditions and high-speed motions (> 11000 pixels/s). The microsecond time resolution achieved means that the filter output can be used to derive secondary information such as time-to-contact or range estimation, that will enable applications to real-world problems such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving.

### [Deep Height Decoupling for Precise Vision-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction]()

The task of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct 3D geometry and estimate its semantic classes from 2D color images, where the 2D-to-3D view transformation is an indispensable step. Most previous methods conduct forward projection, such as BEVPooling and VoxelPooling, both of which map the 2D image features into 3D grids. However, the current grid representing features within a certain height range usually introduces many confusing features that belong to other height ranges. To address this challenge, we present Deep Height Decoupling (DHD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit height prior to filter out the confusing features. Specifically, DHD first predicts height maps via explicit supervision. Based on the height distribution statistics, DHD designs Mask Guided Height Sampling (MGHS) to adaptively decouple the height map into multiple binary masks. MGHS projects the 2D image features into multiple subspaces, where each grid contains features within reasonable height ranges. Finally, a Synergistic Feature Aggregation (SFA) module is deployed to enhance the feature representation through channel and spatial affinities, enabling further occupancy refinement. On the popular Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with minimal input frames. Source code is released at https://github.com/yanzq95/DHD.

### [RE0: Recognize Everything with 3D Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation]()

Recognizing objects in the 3D world is a significant challenge for robotics. Due to the lack of high-quality 3D data, directly training a general-purpose segmentation model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) have revolutionized the 2D computer vision field with outstanding performance, making the use of VFM to assist 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted methods do not effectively address the 2D-3D inconsistency problem or adequately provide corresponding semantic information for 3D instance objects. To address these two issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for 3D zero-shot instance segmentation called RE0. For the given 3D point clouds and multi-view RGB-D images with poses, we leverage the 3D geometric information, projection relationships, and CLIP semantic features. Specifically, we utilize CropFormer to extract mask information from multi-view posed images, combined with projection relationships to assign point-level labels to each point in the point cloud, and achieve instance- level consistency through inter-frame information interaction. Then, we employ projection relationships again to assign CLIP semantic features to the point cloud and achieve aggregation of small-scale point clouds. Notably, RE0 does not require any additional training and can be implemented by supporting only one inference of CropFormer and one inference of CLIP. Experiments on ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves higher quality segmentation than the previous zero-shot methods. Our codes and demos are available at https://recognizeeverything.github.io/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required.

### [PTQ4RIS: Post-Training Quantization for Referring Image Segmentation]()

Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by a given sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguistic information. However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance models, disregarding considerations for practical applications on resources-limited edge devices. This oversight poses a significant challenge for on-device RIS inference. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient post-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance. Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically designed for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS applications.

### [LeAP: Consistent Multi-Domain 3D Labeling Using Foundation Models]()

Availability of datasets is a strong driver for research on 3D semantic understanding, and whilst obtaining unlabeled 3D data is straightforward, manually annotating this data with semantic labels is time-consuming and costly. As a result, labeled 3D datasets have largely been confined to the popular automotive domain due to the abundance of labeled data. Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However, VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label multi-frame 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) further enhances geometric consistency. Through various experiments, we show that our method can generate high-quality 3D semantic labels across diverse fields without any manual labeling. Further, models adapted to new domains using our labels show a significant mIoU increase in semantic segmentation tasks.

### [PlaceFormer: Transformer-Based Visual Place Recognition Using Multi-Scale Patch Selection and Fusion]()

Visual place recognition is a challenging task in the field of computer vision, and autonomous robotics and vehicles, which aims to identify a location or a place from visual inputs. Contemporary methods in visual place recognition employ convolutional neural networks and utilize every region within the image for the place recognition task. However, the presence of dynamic and distracting elements in the image can impact the effectiveness of the place recognition process. Therefore, it is meaningful to focus on the task-relevant regions of the image for improved recognition. In this paper, we present PlaceFormer, a novel transformer-based approach for visual place recognition. PlaceFormer uses patch tokens from the transformer to create global image descriptors, which are then used for image retrieval. To re-rank the retrieved images, PlaceFormer merges the patch tokens from the transformer to form multi-scale patches. Utilizing the transformer's self-attention mechanism, it selects patches that correspond to task-relevant areas in an image. These selected patches undergo geometric verification, generating similarity scores across different patch sizes. Subsequently, the spatial scores from each patch size are fused to produce a final similarity score. This score is then used to re-rank the images initially retrieved using global image descriptors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PlaceFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring less time and memory.

### [Motion-Aware Optical Camera Communication with Event Cameras]()

As the ubiquity of smart mobile devices continues to rise, Optical Camera Communication systems have gained more attention as a solution for efficient and private data streaming. This system utilizes optical cameras to receive data from digital screens via visible light. Despite their promise, most of them are hindered by dynamic factors such as screen refreshing and rapid camera motion. CMOS cameras, often serving as the receivers, suffer from limited frame rates and motion-induced image blur, which degrade overall performance. To address these challenges, this paper unveils a novel system that utilizes event cameras. We introduce a dynamic visual marker and design event-based tracking algorithms to achieve fast localization and data streaming. Remarkably, the event camera's unique capabilities mitigate issues related to screen refresh rates and camera motion, enabling a high throughput of up to 114 Kbps in static conditions, and a 1 cm localization accuracy with 1% bit error rate under various camera motions. We plan on open-sourcing the code upon acceptance.

### [Hybrid State Estimation and Mode Identification of an Amphibious Robot]()

C-Ray is an amphibious robot that is capable of swimming in water and crawling on land using its undulating fins, enabling operations in a wide range of environments. The robot can be modeled as a hybrid dynamical system whose dynamics and propulsion change when the robot transitions between water and land. Most importantly, the direction of wave travel in the robot's fins is reversed between its swimming and crawling locomotion styles. To operate autonomously, C-Ray requires both accurate identification of when transitions between water and land occur and robust state estimation in littoral environments where the transition dynamics are highly discontinuous and transient. This paper presents a hybrid observer for estimating continuous states and identifying state-driven mode switches for C-Ray, enabling autonomous water/land-transitions. The proposed observer is a combination of the multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) and the salted Kalman filter, a newly proposed Kalman filter for mapping state uncertainty during hybrid transitions. We also propose an altitude and sea floor geometry observer and incorporate this directly into the MEKF. The performance is evaluated in simulations.

### [LiDARDustX: A LiDAR Dataset for Dusty Unstructured Road Environments]()

Abstract— Autonomous driving datasets are essential for validating the progress of intelligent vehicle algorithms, which　include localization, perception, and prediction. However, existing datasets are predominantly focused on structured urban　environments, which limits the exploration of unstructured　and specialized scenarios, particularly those characterized by　significant dust levels. This paper introduces the LiDARDustX　dataset, which is specifically designed for perception tasks under　high-dust conditions, such as those encountered in mining areas.　The LiDARDustX dataset consists of 30,000 LiDAR frames　captured by six different LiDAR sensors, each accompanied by　3D bounding box annotations and point cloud semantic segmentation. Notably, over 80% of the dataset comprises dust-affected　scenes. By utilizing this dataset, we have established a benchmark for evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art 3D detection and segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we have ana- lyzed the impact of dust on perception accuracy and delved into　the causes of these effects. The data and further information can　be accessed at: https://github.com/vincentweikey/LiDARDustX.

### [How about Them Apples: 3D Pose and Cluster Estimation of Apple Fruitlets in a Commercial Orchard]()

Aotearoa’s apple industry struggles to maintain the skilled workforce required for fruitlet thinning each year. Skilled labourers play a pivotal role in managing crop loads by precisely thinning fruitlets to achieve the desired spacing for high-quality apple growth. This complex task requires accurate mapping of the fruitlets along each branch. This paper presents a novel vision system capable of mapping the orientation and clustering information of apple fruitlets as a human expert does. The vision system has been validated against data collected from a real-world commercial apple orchard. The results show an improved counting accuracy of 83.97% over prior implementations, an orientation estimate accuracy of 88.1%, and a clustering accuracy of 94.3%. Future work will utilise this information to determine which fruitlets to remove and then robotically thin them from the canopy.

### [Active Semantic Mapping with Mobile Manipulator in Horticultural Environments]()

Semantic maps are fundamental for robotics tasks such as navigation and manipulation. They also enable yield prediction and phenotyping in agricultural settings. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach for active semantic mapping in horticultural environments, employing a mobile robot manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera. Our method leverages probabilistic semantic maps to detect semantic targets, generate candidate viewpoints, and compute the corresponding information gain. We present an efficient ray-casting strategy and a novel information utility function that accounts for both semantics and occlusions. The proposed approach reduces total runtime by 8% compared to previous baselines. Furthermore, our information metric surpasses other metrics in reducing multiclass entropy and improving surface coverage, particularly in the presence of segmentation noise. Real-world experiments validate our method's effectiveness but also reveal challenges such as depth sensor noise and varying environmental conditions, requiring further research.

### [Surface Roughness Estimation for Terrain Perception]()

Ground terrain perception has become the primary visual task for the robust navigation of intelligent systems in unstructured outdoor environments. However, complex terrain poses a significant challenge to vision-based perception. This work introduces a novel estimation task using RGB images to facilitate low-cost terrain perception in extracting surface roughness information. The proposed task presents both semantic-aware and edge-aware roughness descriptors at the pixel level instead of a single value for a given image. To promote the research on the proposed novel terrain roughness estimation task, we introduce a multimodal synthetic dataset for terrain perception in outdoor scenes, containing multiple terrain categories, diverse viewpoints, different lighting and weather conditions, as well as semantic and roughness annotations. Additionally, inspired by computer graphics, we introduce TRENet, a roughness estimation architecture to model the intrinsic correlation of depth-normal-roughness. We also perform ablation studies on the effect of each component and diverse types of inputs. Extensive evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that our method can effectively predict pixel-wise terrain surface roughness with high accuracy.

### [Automatic Identification of Individual African Leopards in Unlabeled Camera Trap Images (I)]()

This article describes an algorithm to solve the real-world animal identification problem, i.e., determine the unknown number of K individual animals in a dataset of N unlabeled camera-trap images of African leopards, provided by Panthera. To determine the leopards’ IDs, we propose an effective automated algorithm, that consists of segmenting leopard bodies from images, scoring similarity between image pairs, and clustering followed by verification. To perform clustering, we employ a modified ternary search that uses a novel adaptive k-medoids++ clustering algorithm. The best clustering is determined using an expanded definition of the silhouette score. A new post-clustering verification procedure is used to further improve the quality of a clustering. The algorithm was evaluated using the Panthera dataset that consists of 677 individual leopards taken from 1555 images, and resulted in a clustering with an adjusted mutual information score of 0.958 as compared to 0.864 using a baseline k-medoids++ clustering algorithm.

### [RoadRunner M&M: Learning Multi-Range Multi-Resolution Traversability Maps for Autonomous Off-Road Navigation]()

Autonomous robot navigation in off-road environments requires a comprehensive understanding of the terrain geometry and traversability. The degraded perceptual conditions and sparse geometric information at longer ranges make the problem challenging especially when driving at high speeds. Furthermore, the sensing-to-mapping latency and the look-ahead map range can limit the maximum speed of the vehicle. Building on top of the recent work RoadRunner, in this work, we address the challenge of long-range (±100m) traversability estimation. Our RoadRunner (M&M) is an end-to-end learning-based framework that directly predicts the traversability and elevation maps at multiple ranges (±50m, ±100m) and resolutions (0.2m, 0.8m) taking as input multiple images and a LiDAR voxel map. Our method is trained in a self-supervised manner by leveraging the dense supervision signal generated by fusing predictions from an existing traversability estimation stack (X-Racer) in hindsight and satellite Digital Elevation Maps. RoadRunner M&M achieves a significant improvement of up to 50% for elevation mapping and 30% for traversability estimation over RoadRunner, and is able to predict in 30% more regions compared to X-Racer while achieving real-time performance. Experiments on various out-of-distribution datasets also demonstrate that our data-driven approach starts to generalize to novel unstructured environments. We integrate our proposed framework in closed-loop with the path planner to demonstrate autonomous high-speed off-road robotic navigation in challenging real-world environments.

### [RipGAN: A GAN-Based Rip Current Data Augmentation Method]()

Rip currents are a major hazard on beaches worldwide, and their strong, offshore-directed currents can place even experienced beachgoers at risk of drowning. While it is intuitive to consider developing an automated rip current detection system to assist lifeguards in protecting beachgoers, rip current detection is in its infancy due to the lack of high-quality large-scale annotated rip current datasets. Also, the collection and annotation of rip current images require expert knowledge, which makes it more difficult to build datasets. So, this paper proposes a GAN-based rip current data augmentation method, RipGAN, to improve the performance of rip current detectors by increasing representative training data. To create new training images, RipGAN, has two branches. One is a texture generator that enriches the pattern and texture details of waves, making the image more realistic. The other is a rip generator based on FFFM-Unet. FFFM (Fast Fourier Fusion Module) uses Fast Fourier convolution to fuse the features from the low and the high layers, so as to further optimise the generated image. Furthermore, we trained Yolov8, YOLOv10, DINO and RT-DETR as rip current detectors to prove the effectiveness of RipGAN. The detectors' mAP 50:95 improved by 2.67% on the test set and AP 50 by 4.93% on real-scene videos, outperforming other data augmentation methods. Besides, abundant ablation studies have been conducted to further evaluate each component of RipGAN.

### [Points, Images and Texts: Boosting Point Cloud Completion with Multi-Modal Features]()

Point cloud completion is crucial for reconstructing accurate shapes in many 3D visual applications. Recent approaches incorporate images into the completion pipeline, introducing geometric clues and global constraints. However, their fusion processes often fail to reconstruct detailed parts and maintain global consistency simultaneously. Except for images, text is another important clue for recognizing the target’s characteristics. Thus, in this work, we propose to combine multiple modalities including points, images and texts for point cloud completion. Specifically, inspired by recently pre-trained large language models, we generate the description texts for images by Visual Question Answering (VQA) models and introduce Visual-Textual Embedding (VTE) models to extract joint features of image-text pairs. Furthermore, we describe the edge geometric patterns by multi-scale edge convolution to guide the refinement of shapes in local areas. Then we adopt cross attention mechanism to effectively fuse multi-modal features and refine the coarse shape. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark demonstrate our method’s superior performance over previous uni-modal and cross-modal methods.

### [3DWG: 3D Weakly Supervised Visual Grounding Via Category and Instance-Level Alignment]()

The 3D weakly-supervised visual grounding task aims to localize oriented 3D boxes in point clouds based on natural language descriptions without requiring annotations to guide model learning. This setting presents two primary challenges: category-level ambiguity and instance-level complexity. Category-level ambiguity arises from representing objects of fine-grained categories in a highly sparse point cloud format, making category distinction challenging. Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the same category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding approach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances. In the category-level branch, we utilize extensive category knowledge from a pre-trained external detector to align object proposal features with sentence-level category features, thereby enhancing category awareness. In the instance-level branch, we utilize spatial relationship descriptions from language queries to refine object proposal features, ensuring clear differentiation among objects. These designs enable our model to accurately identify target-category objects while distinguishing instances within the same category. Compared to previous methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used benchmarks: Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRef.

### [MPI-Mamba : Cross Propagation Mamba for Multipath Interference Correction]()

Owing to their compact structure, high stability,and low cost, Indirect Time-of-Fligh (IToF) cameras have gained increasing attention in the fields of robotics and automation. However, in real-world scenarios, IToF cameras are affected by multipath interference, which severely degrades imaging quality. Existing learning-based methods for multipath interference correction are all based on CNN architectures and rely on synthetic datasets, leading to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We proposed an efficient and accurate real data collection scheme and explored the application of Transformer and Mamba in multipath interference correction tasks. Additionally, we introduced a cross-propagation network that integrates Mamba and CNN modules, reducing system complexity to linear levels while achieving superior multipath interference correction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [SurgPLAN++: Universal Surgical Phase Localization Network for Online and Offline Inference]()

Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/franciszchen/SurgPLAN-Plus.

### [Real-Time LiDAR Point Cloud Compression and Transmission for Resource-Constrained Robots]()

LiDARs are widely used in autonomous robots due to their ability to provide accurate environment structural information. However, the large size of point clouds poses challenges in terms of data storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud compression and transmission framework for resource-constrained robotic applications, called RCPCC. We iteratively fit the surface of point clouds with a similar range value and eliminate redundancy through their spatial relationships. Then, we use Shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) to transform the unfit points and reduce the data volume by quantizing the transformed coefficients. We design an adaptive bitrate control strategy based on QoE as the optimization goal to control the quality of the transmitted point cloud. Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of 40x to 80x while maintaining high accuracy for downstream applications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70x. Fur thermore, in situations of reduced communication bandwidth, our adaptive bitrate control strategy demonstrates significant QoE improvements.

### [A Shared Autonomy System for Precise and Efficient Remote Underwater Manipulation]()

Conventional underwater intervention operations using robotic vehicles require expert teleoperators and limit interaction with remote scientists. We present the SHared Autonomy for Remote Collaboration (SHARC) framework that enables novice operators to cooperatively conduct underwater sampling and manipulation tasks. With SHARC, operators can plan and complete manipulation tasks using natural language or hand gestures through a virtual reality (SHARC-VR) interface. The interface provides remote operators with a contextual 3D scene understanding that is updated according to bandwidth availability. Evaluation of the SHARC framework through controlled lab experiments demonstrates that SHARC-VR enables novice operators to complete manipulation tasks in framerate-limited conditions (i.e., 0.1–0.5 frames per second) faster than expert pilots using a conventional topside controller. For both novice and expert users, the SHARC-VR interface also increases the task completion rate and improves sampling precision. The SHARC framework is readily extensible to other hardware architectures, including terrestrial and space systems.

### [E2Map: Experience-And-Emotion Map for Self-Reflective Robot Navigation with Language Models]()

Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

### [Improving Zero-Shot ObjectNav with Generative Communication]()

We propose a new method for improving Zero-Shot ObjectNav that aims to utilize potentially available environmental percepts for navigational assistance. Our approach takes into account that the ground agent may have limited and sometimes obstructed view. Our formulation encourages Generative Communication (GC) between an assistive overhead agent with a global view containing the target object and the ground agent with an obfuscated view; both equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for vision-to-language translation. In this assisted setup, the embodied agents communicate environmental information before the ground agent executes actions towards a target. Despite the overhead agent having a global view with the target, we note a drop in performance (-13% in OSR and -13% in SPL) of a fully cooperative assistance scheme over an unassisted baseline. In contrast, a selective assistance scheme where the ground agent retains its independent exploratory behaviour shows a 10% OSR and 7.65% SPL improvement. To explain navigation performance, we analyze the GC for unique traits, quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. Specifically, we identify the novel linguistic trait of preemptive hallucination in our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move, and note its strong correlation with navigation performance. We conduct real-world experiments and present some qualitative examples where we mitigate hallucinations via prompt finetuning to improve ObjectNav performance.

### [Commonsense Reasoning for Legged Robot Adaptation with Vision-Language Models]()

Legged robots are physically capable of navigating a diverse variety of environments and overcoming a wide range of obstructions. For example, in a search and rescue mission, a legged robot could climb over debris, crawl through gaps, and navigate out of dead ends. However, the robot’s controller needs to respond intelligently to such varied obstacles, and this requires handling unexpected and unusual scenarios successfully. This presents an open challenge to current learning methods, which often struggle with generalization to the long tail of unexpected situations without heavy human supervision. To address this issue, we investigate how to leverage the broad knowledge about the structure of the world and commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to aid legged robots in handling difficult, ambiguous situations. We propose a system, VLM-Predictive Control (VLM-PC), combining two key components that we find to be crucial for eliciting on-the-fly, adaptive behavior selection with VLMs: (1) in-context adaptation over previous robot interactions and (2) planning multiple skills into the future and replanning. We evaluate VLM-PC on several challenging real-world obstacle courses, involving dead ends and climbing and crawling, on a Go1 quadruped robot. Our experiments show that by reasoning over the history of interactions and future plans, VLMs enable the robot to autonomously perceive, navigate, and act in a wide range of complex scenarios that would otherwise require environment- specific engineering or human guidance.

### [Language-Guided Object-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable and Collision-Aware Manipulation]()

Learning from demonstrations faces challenges in generalizing beyond the training data and often lacks collision awareness. This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, ambiguous similar objects, while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving high success rate with few demonstrations. We train diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects and use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations, across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.

### [This&That: Language-Gesture Controlled Video Generation for Robot Planning]()

Clear, interpretable instructions are invaluable for complex tasks, helping to clarify goals and anticipate necessary steps. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. Through this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That adds gesture conditioning alongside language to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.

### [Quantifying the Risk of Unmapped Associations for Mobile Robot Localization Safety]()

Integrity risk is a measure of localization safety that accounts for the presence of undetected sensor faults. The metric has been used for decades in aviation and has recently been applied to terrestrial robots operating in life-critical missions. For ground vehicles, integrity risk can be quantified for systems using lidar measurements, where twospecific fault types have been identified: miss-association and unmapped association. While miss-association faults, which occur when acorrectly extracted feature is associated to the wrong landmark, have been well-studied, the probability of an unmapped association fault, where an incorrectly extracted feature is associated to a landmark, is not well-understood. Namely, previous research has never quantified this value and instead relies on an assumed value, one whose value has not been properly justified. This work is the first to provide a methodology that estimates the risk of unmapped association for each mapped landmark; the paper demonstrates the effect of this probability for both the chi-squared and fixed-lag smoothing methods for integrity monitoring. Data collected in downtown Chicago, IL USA was used to tes

### [Control Strategies for Pursuit-Evasion under Occlusion Using Visibility and Safety Barrier Functions]()

This paper develops a control strategy for pursuit-evasion problems in environments with occlusions. We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements.

### [Dynamic Gap: Safe Gap-Based Navigation in Dynamic Environments]()

This paper extends the family of gap-based local planners to unknown dynamic environments through generating provably collision-free properties for hierarchical navigation systems. Existing perception-informed local planners that operate in dynamic environments rely on emergent or empirical robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of dynamic obstacles. In addition to this, the obstacle tracking that is performed in these existent planners is often achieved with respect to a global inertial frame, subjecting such tracking estimates to transformation errors from odometry drift. The proposed local planner, dynamic gap, shifts the tracking paradigm to modeling how the free space, represented as gaps, evolves over time. Gap crossing and closing conditions are developed to aid in determining the feasibility of passage through gaps, and a breadth of simulation benchmarking is performed against other navigation planners in the literature where the proposed dynamic gap planner achieves the highest success rate out of all planners tested in all environments.

### [Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance with Spheres]()

Safe motion planning algorithms are necessary for deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments. Motion plans must be safe to ensure that the robot does not harm humans or damage any nearby objects. Generating these motion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt to sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods introduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially increasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon trajectory planner that generates probablistically-safe motion plans. Offline, CROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a sphere-based reachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion. CROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that provides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At runtime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is probabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free. We demonstrate that CROWS outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods in solving challenging motion planning tasks in cluttered environments while remaining collision-free. Code, data, and video demonstrations can be found at url{https://roahmlab.github.io/crows/}.

### [System-Level Safety Monitoring and Recovery for Perception Failures in Autonomous Vehicles]()

The safety-critical nature of autonomous vehicle(AV) operation necessitates development of task-relevant algorithms that can reason about safety at the system level and not just at the component level. To reason about the impact of a perception failure on the entire system performance, such task-relevant algorithms must contend with various challenges: complexity of AV stacks, high uncertainty in the operating environments, and the need for real-time performance. To overcome these challenges, in this work, we introduce a Q-network called SPARQ (abbreviation for Safety evaluation for Perception And Recovery Q-network) that evaluates the safety of a plan generated by a planning algorithm, accounting for perception failures that the planning process may have overlooked. This Q-network can be queried during system runtime to assess whether a proposed plan is safe for execution or poses potential safety risks. If a violation is detected, the network can then recommend a corrective plan while accounting for the perceptual failure. We validate our algorithm using the NuPlan-Vegas dataset, demonstrating its ability to handle cases where a perception failure compromises a proposed plan, while the corrective plan remains safe. We observe an overall accuracy and recall of 90% while sustaining a frequency of 42HZ on the unseen testing dataset. We compare our performance to a popular reachability based baseline and analysed some interesting properties of our approach in improving the safety properties of an AV pipeline.

### [Safety Filtering While Training: Improving the Performance and Sample Efficiency of Reinforcement Learning Agents]()

Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are flexible and performant but rarely guarantee safety. Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we analyze several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of training RL with safety filters, featuring simulated and real-world experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. We examine how various training modifications and hyperparameters impact performance, sample efficiency, safety, and chattering. Our findings serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers focused on safety filters and safe RL.

### [Pneumatic Logic Systems for Selectively Operating Distributed Pneumatic Elements]()

Microfluidic and pneumatic logic systems are valuable for applications such as lab-on-a-chip devices, soft robotics, and factory automation. These systems are particularly advantageous when metal or electronic components are impractical or when there are constraints on the control system volume or weight. This paper introduces a novel individual membrane valve that functions as a set-reset latch and can reduce the number of valves required for some pneumatic or microfluidic logic systems. An application of pneumatic logic systems in soft robotics is the access to multiple tethered pneumatic elements through a reduced number of pneumatic lines. To this end, this paper proposes two pneumatic logic systems capable of selecting among multiple distributed sets of pneumatic elements and operating the elements of the set simultaneously and independently through the different pneumatic lines. The selection is achieved via a sequence of pressure pulses applied on the same lines used afterwards for operation. Two prototypes of these pneumatic logic systems were built and successfully demonstrated, consisting primarily of set-reset membrane valves and powered by binary high/low pressure sources. The first prototype features a hierarchical network with four lines and five sets of three pneumatic elements each; the second prototype features a non-hierarchical network with five lines and twelve sets of four pneumatic elements each.

### [Helical Structured Soft Growing Robot for Hazardous Gas Suction in Inaccessible Environments]()

Immediate removal of hazardous gases is critical for ensuring safety. Traditional methods, such as portable ventilation equipment, are difficult to use when hazardous gases are released in inaccessible environments. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism that integrates an inflatable helical structure into a soft growing robot. The proposed mechanism is capable of performing suction through its inner channel after navigating complex environments, while maintaining the inherent advantages of the soft growing robot as it grows. The mechanism operates in two phases: a growing phase, in which the robot extends by eversion, and a suction phase, in which suction is performed through the inner channel of the robot. Experiments and demonstrations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. The experimental results confirmed the ability to maintain the passageway shape of the inner channel during suction operations and provided a design guideline. The demonstration validated that the mechanism can effectively navigate inaccessible environments and perform suction to remove hazardous gases.

### [Shape-Programming Robotic Reflectors for Wireless Networks]()

With the increasing use of wireless technologies in robotics for communication, sensing, and localization, the potential benefits of how robotics can complement and enhance wireless systems remain underexplored. This paper explores a novel application of the existing inflatable robots for wireless communication systems by forming a shape-programming, reflective waveguide that enhances the received signal quality for wireless devices. Our primary target is enhancing Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP WANs) – where 10-year battery-powered client devices (e.g. energy meters or smart home sensors) connect to cellular-like powered base stations to deliver data. Devices in these networks often experience significant seasonal variability in battery life – even simple obstructions between the device and base station (e.g. due to construction) can shave off years of battery life. We propose MetaMorph, a programmable robotic reflector attached to base stations that enhances signal quality from client devices by enhancing received signal energy with controlled reflections. We investigate the design of the reflector, and our experiments show the ability to improve the signal quality for LP-WAN(LoRa) communication systems demonstrating signal quality and battery-benefits. To our best knowledge, MetaMorph is the first paper to explore how flexible robotics can serve as virtuous reflectors for wireless communication systems.

### [MORF: Magnetic Origami Reprogramming and Folding System for Repeatably Reconfigurable Structures with Fold Angle Control]()

We present the Magnetic Origami Reprogramming and Folding System (MORF), a magnetically reprogrammable system capable of precise shape control, repeated transformations, and adaptive functionality for robotic applications. Unlike current self-folding systems, which often lack re-programmability or lose rigidity after folding, MORF generates stiff structures over multiple folding cycles without degradation in performance. The ability to reconfigure and maintain structural stability is crucial for tasks such as reconfigurable tooling. The system utilizes a thermoplastic layer sandwiched within a thin magnetically responsive laminate sheet, enabling structures to self-fold in response to a combination of external magnetic field and heating. We demonstrate that the resulting folded structures can bear loads over 40 times their own weight and can undergo up to 50 cycles of repeated transformations without losing structural integrity. We showcase these strengths in a reconfigurable tool for unscrewing and screwing bolts and screws of various sizes, allowing the tool to adapt its shape to different bolt sizes while withstanding the mechanical stresses involved. This capability highlights the system’s potential for task-varying, load-bearing applications in robotics, where both versatility and durability are essential.

### [Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping across Varying Ground Profiles]()

We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaption), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.

### [Online Learning Based Shape Control for a Soft Manipulator Based on Spatial Features Feedback]()

Although soft manipulators are endowed with compliance and flexibility, most control strategies focus on end-effector control and lack shape control ability. This letter aims to design a shape controller for the soft manipulator. Firstly, we establish a modified forward kinematics model (FKM) based on the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) neural network to describe the mapping between actuation inputs and spatial features. The spatial features consist of the backbone curve and contour features. The backbone curve is represented by the piecewise Bézier curve under geometrically continuous constraint. The contour features are extracted from the camera-generated point cloud. Besides, an adaptive online learning based shape controller (OLSC) is designed by online back-propagating shape error. The stability of OLSC is proved based on the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the random excitation model validation experiment demonstrates the prediction accuracy of the proposed modified FKM, and the shape control experiments in air and water validate the effectiveness of the proposed OLSC.

### [Augmenting Compliance with Motion Generation through Imitation Learning Using Drop-Stitch Reinforced Inflatable Robot Arm with Rigid Joints]()

Safe physical human-robot collaboration can be possible with soft robots due to their inherent compliance and low inertia. Soft bodies provide passive compliance and adaptability due to their deformations, but these same characteristics also lead to difficulty in dynamic control and mathematical modeling. We focus on motion generation for a 3-DOF (Degree of freedom) inflatable robot arm, consisting of soft inflatable body links and rigid joints. This research explores the limitations of relying only on soft robot compliance for contact-based tasks. Our goal is to generate adaptive motion for contact-based tasks by exploiting the compliance of the soft links. We compare contact-based tasks for the inflatable robot with and without a learning model. This shows improved performance when soft robot compliance is augmented with imitation learning. The combination of soft robot compliance and the machine learning model's adaptability shows the potential for collaborative robots to interact with humans and their surroundings safely.

### [Safe Human-UAS Collaboration from High-Level Planning to Low-Level Tracking (I)]()

This paper studies the problem of safe human-uncrewed aerial system (UAS) collaboration in a shared work environment. By considering human and UAS as co-workers, we use Petri Nets to abstractly model evolution of shared tasks assigned to human and UAS co-workers. Particularly, the Petri Nets’ “places” represent work stations; therefore, the Petri Nets’ transitions can formally specify displacements between the work stations. The paper’s first objective is to incorporate uncertainty regarding the intentions of human co-workers into motion planning for UAS, when UAS closely interacts with human co-workers. To this end, the proposed Petri Nets model uses “conflict” constructs to represent situations at which UAS deals with incomplete knowledge about human co-worker intention. The paper’s second objective is then to plan the motion of the UAS in a resilient and safe manner, in the presence of non-cooperative human co-workers. In order to achieve this objective, UAS equipped with onboard perception and decision-making capabilities are able to, through real-time processing of in-situ observation, predict human intention, quantify human distraction, and apply a non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to safely plan UAS motion in the presence of uncertainty. Given the current and next UAS waypoints, the paper applies Potryagin’s minimal principle to plan the desired trajectory of the UAS and uses feedback linearaztion method for trajectory tracking control.

### [Reliable and Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination Via Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders]()

Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in shared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem faster than through centralized optimization at scale.	We formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines.

### [Efficient Cross-Boundary Grasping in Stacked Clutter with Single-Visual Mapping Multi-Step]()

In logistics applications, the vision-based technology for grasping target objects in the air is relatively mature. However, when operating across the air and water, such as grasping marine products from the water, the visual information collected by the camera will be disturbed by ripples and bubbles on the water surface, resulting in low grasping efficiency. Therefore, we introduce a grasping strategy based on single-visual mapping for multi-step (SVMMS) operations, which is suitable for cross-medium operations involving stacked objects. Specifically, we design a multifunctional integrated network model based on Deep Q-learning, which extracts visual features from the scene to detect stacked objects and outputs their hierarchical relationships effectively. Moreover, we quantify the potential relationship between motion logic during action execution and changes in RGB-D information to help the robot achieve efficient and collision-free operations. Our approach also incorporates a time-series design with prioritized experience replay to optimize the action sequence globally. Additionally, we propose a novel sim2real method by combining domain randomization to address the difference in object sizes between the simulation and the real world. Extensive experiments in both simulation and physical environments show that SVMMS-Grasp significantly outperforms existing methods regarding task success rate, stability, and operational efficiency.

### [Efficient Second-Order Cone Programming for the Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem]()

When agents must execute multiple tasks at spatially distinct locations, it is common to formulate and solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the order of locations (targets) that requires the smallest travel cost. Approaching such task sequencing problems as a TSP is restrictive, as it requires that unique locations be specified for each task. In reality a set of acceptable locations might be available. The Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem in which the agent needs only visit a spherical neighborhood surrounding each target, and can thus address this task sequencing problem when any location in a sphere is acceptable. Prior work has developed a branch-and-bound approach that finds globally optimal solutions to instances of the CETSP by solving a sequence of Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP). We demonstrate it is possible to eliminate 2/3 of the variables and 1/2 of the constraints in these SOCPs, show how to reuse computation and memory allocation across multiple SOCPs in the sequence, and propose a strategy to warm-start the SOCPs using solutions obtained earlier in the sequence. Collectively, these three changes halve the time required to solve 210 random CETSP instances to optimality. We also obtained improved lower bounds on 73 instances from the literature, including solving one instance to optimality for the first time.

### [Decoupled Training Neural Solver for Dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem]()

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have achieved remarkable success in solving static traveling salesman problems (TSP). However, dynamic TSP (DTSP), with the random appearance of new customers over time, introduces additional complexities that challenge DRL methods by the difficulty of obtaining optimized routing policy which lead to sub-optimal results and reduced training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a decoupled training neural solver (DTNS) based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a novel approach that decouples the optimization of encoder and decoder, enhancing the model's ability to handle dynamic changes. Our method involves training under an Fore-Reveal condition first where the information of all customers nodes are known in advance to obtain optimized encoder and initialization for decoder and then fine-tuning the decoder in dynamic scenarios where dynamic customers are revealed over time. This training paradigm results in a flexible and globally optimized routing policy. Experimental results demonstrate that DTNS efficiently adapts to new customer requests in dynamic scenario, outperforming existing methods in dynamic routing environments.

### [Multi-Drone-Truck Collaborative Delivery with En Route Operations: A Hierarchical MARL-Based Approach]()

The multi-drone-truck collaborative delivery, where unmanned trucks serve as mobile supply stations for drones, effectively combines the strengths of both vehicles and presents wide application prospects. But the majority of existing literature restricts drone launch and retrieve operations (LARO) to stationary truck, and potential drone route collisions are mostly ignored. This leads to inability to fully exploit the capability of drones. We address these gaps and introduce a new variant of multi-drone-truck collaborative delivery. However, the scheduling for drones and truck faces high-dimensional solution space and complex constraints, making it almost impossible for centralized solving. To this end, we develop a hierarchical solution framework that decomposes the complete problem into two levels of subproblem. The upper solver centrally allocates tasks and schedules when drones to launch, while the lower solver, based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), plans paths for each drone agent in a decentralized but cooperative manner. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our method by benchmarking it against three state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its superiority in terms of both efficiency and collision avoidance.

### [Risk-Aware Energy-Constrained UAV-UGV Cooperative Routing Using Attention-Guided Reinforcement Learning]()

Maximizing the endurance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in large-scale monitoring missions spanning over large areas requires addressing their limited battery capacity. Deploying unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) as mobile recharging stations offers a practical solution, extending UAVs’ operational range. This introduces the challenge of optimizing UAV-UGV routes for efficient mission point coverage and seamless recharging coordination. In this paper, we present a risk-aware deep reinforcement learning (Ra-DRL) framework with a multi-head attention mechanism within an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to solve this cooperative routing problem for a UAV-UGV team. Our model minimizes mission time while accounting for the stochastic fuel consumption of the UAV, influenced by environmental factors like wind velocity, ensuring adherence to a risk threshold to avoid mid-mission energy depletion. Extensive evaluations on various problem sizes show that our method significantly outperforms nearest-neighbor heuristics in both solution quality and risk management. We validate the Ra-DRL policy in a Gazebo-ROS SITL environment with a PX4-based custom UAV and Clearpath Husky UGV. The results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our policy, making it highly effective for mission planning in dynamic, uncertain scenarios.

### [Ground-Aware Automotive Radar Odometry]()

Odometry is crucial for the navigation of autonomous vehicles in unknown environments. While cameras and LiDARs are commonly used to estimate the ego-motion of a vehicle, these sensors face limitations under bad lighting and severe weather conditions. Automotive radars overcome these challenges, but radar point clouds are generally sparse and noisy, making it difficult to identify useful features within a radar scan. In this paper, we address the problem of ego-motion estimation using a single automotive radar sensor. We propose a simple, yet effective, heuristic-based method to extract the ground plane from single radar scans and perform ground plane matching between consecutive scans. Additionally, we perform a windowed factor-graph optimization of the poses together with the ground plane, improving the accuracy of the pose estimation. We put our work to the test using the 4DRadarDataset. Our findings illustrate the state-of-the-art performance of our odometry approach compared to existing alternatives that use radar point clouds.

### [CAO-RONet: A Robust 4D Radar Odometry with Exploring More Information from Low-Quality Points]()

Recently, 4D millimetre-wave radar exhibits more stable perception ability than LiDAR and camera under adverse conditions (e.g. rain and fog). However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry. The code will be released at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/CAO-RONet.

### [Radar Teach and Repeat: Architecture and Initial Field Testing]()

Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) scanning radar has emerged as an alternative to spinning LiDAR for state estimation on mobile robots. Radar's longer wavelength is less affected by small particulates, providing operational advantages in challenging environments such as dust, smoke, and fog. This paper presents Radar Teach and Repeat (RT&R): a full-stack radar system for long-term off-road robot autonomy. RT&R can drive routes reliably in off-road cluttered areas without any GPS. We benchmark the radar system's closed-loop path-tracking performance and compare it to its 3D LiDAR counterpart. 11.8 km of autonomous driving was completed without interventions using only radar and gyro for navigation. RT&R was evaluated on four different routes with progressively less structured scene geometry. RT&R achieved lateral path-tracking root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 5.6 cm, 7.5 cm, and 12.1 cm as the routes became more challenging. These RMSE values are less than half of the width of one tire (24 cm) on our robot testing platform. These same routes have worst-case errors of 21.7 cm, 24.0 cm, and 43.8 cm. We conclude that radar is a viable alternative to LiDAR for long-term autonomy in challenging off-road scenarios. The implementation of RT&R is open-source and available at: https://github.com/utiasASRL/vtr3.

### [Structure-Aware Radar-Camera Depth Estimation]()

Radar has gained much attention in autonomous driving due to its accessibility and robustness. However, its standalone application for depth perception is constrained by issues of sparsity and noise. Radar-camera depth estimation offers a more promising complementary solution. Despite significant progress, current approaches fail to produce satisfactory dense depth maps, due to the unsatisfactory processing of the sparse and noisy radar data. They constrain the regions of interest for radar points in rigid rectangular regions, which may introduce unexpected errors and confusions. To address these issues, we develop a structure-aware strategy for radar depth enhancement, which provides more targeted regions of interest by leveraging the structural priors of RGB images. Furthermore, we design a Multi-Scale Structure Guided Network to enhance radar features and preserve detailed structures, achieving accurate and structure-detailed dense metric depth estimation. Building on these, we propose a structure-aware radar-camera depth estimation framework, named SA-RCD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SA-RCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset. Our code will be available at https://github.com/FreyZhangYeh/SA-RCD.

### [Doppler Former: Velocity Supervision of Raw Radar Data]()

Thanks to the high robustness of 4D millimeter-wave radar in various environments, it has been widely applied in the field of autonomous driving. Recent research has increasingly focused on utilizing raw data, as a substitute for the sparse and noisy point cloud data. However, these approaches have not fully exploited the Doppler features present in the raw data. In this paper, we introduce the Doppler Former (DPF) module to efficiently extract velocity information from the target environment. DPF can be seamlessly integrated into most radar perception backbone and enhance their performance in downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose a new backbone, Fully Complex Convolutional Network (FCCN), which is more suitable for raw data. By incorporating the DPF module into FCCN, we achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the RADIal dataset, with code available at https://github.com/coconut-zs/Fvidar-DopplerFormer.

### [Robust High-Speed State Estimation for Off-Road Navigation Using Radar Velocity Factors]()

Enabling robot autonomy in complex environments for mission critical application requires robust state estimation. Particularly under conditions where the exteroceptive sensors, which the navigation depends on, can be degraded by environmental challenges thus, leading to mission failure. It is precisely in such challenges where the potential for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensors is highlighted: as a complementary exteroceptive sensing modality with direct velocity measuring capabilities. In this work we integrate radial speed measurements from a FMCW radar sensor, using a radial speed factor, to provide linear velocity updates into a sliding–window state estimator for fusion with LiDAR pose and IMU measurements. We demonstrate that this augmentation increases the robustness of the state estimator to challenging conditions present in the environment and the negative effects they can pose to vulnerable exteroceptive modalities. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using robotic field experiments conducted using an autonomous, full-scale, off-road vehicle operating at high-speeds (~12 m/s) in complex desert environments. Furthermore, the robustness of the approach is demonstrated for cases of both simulated and real-world degradation of the LiDAR odometry performance along with comparison against state-of-the-art methods for radar-inertial odometry on public datasets.

### [Graph-Based SLAM-Aware Exploration with Prior Topo-Metric Information]()

Autonomous exploration requires a robot to explore an unknown environment while constructing an accurate map using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques. Without prior information, the exploration performance is usually conservative due to the limited planning horizon. This paper exploits a prior topo-metric graph of the environment to benefit both the exploration efficiency and the pose graph reliability in SLAM. Based on the relationship between pose graph reliability and graph topology, we formulate a SLAM-aware path planning problem over the prior graph, which finds a fast exploration path enhanced with the globally informative loop-closing actions to stabilize the SLAM pose graph. A greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, in which we derive theoretical thresholds that significantly prune non-optimal loop-closing actions without affecting the potential informative ones. Furthermore, we incorporate the proposed planner into a hierarchical exploration framework, with flexible features including path replanning, and online prior graph update that adds additional information to the prior graph. Simulation and real-world experiments indicate that the proposed method can reliably achieve higher mapping accuracy than compared methods when exploring environments with rich topologies, while maintaining comparable exploration efficiency. Our method is open-sourced on GitHub.

### [Dynamic Multi-Objective Ergodic Path Planning Using Decomposition Methods]()

Robots are often employed in hazardous or inaccessible environments, such as disaster sites, extraterrestrial terrains, agricultural fields, and ocean floors. Autonomous operation is crucial in these scenarios to reduce reliance on human operators and enable real-time decision-making. However, robots must balance multiple, often conflicting, objectives. These objectives are subject to change based on new data or evolving conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic multi-objective trajectory planning. The proposed method leverages the boundary intersection decomposition technique to adaptively plan trajectories that balance multiple evolving objectives. Our approach ensures efficient and effective exploration by continuously optimizing the trade-offs between changing objectives. We show that our method performs on average 34% better in terms of solution quality on the dynamic multi-objective trajectory planning problem as compared to prior work.

### [Rapid Autonomous Exploration of Large-Scale Environments for Ground Robots Based on Region Partitioning]()

Autonomous exploration in large environments often leads to inefficient long backtracking, as distant targets are prioritized over closer ones. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a hierarchical planning method based on region partitioning. The space is dynamically partitioned at a coarse resolution, and as exploration progresses, regions with sufficient known areas are further subdivided to locate unknown areas more precisely. A utility function considering unknown area size, travel distance, and sequence similarity is used, and the simulated annealing algorithm generates a subregion sequence for global guidance. Within each subregion, a linear acceleration model helps select target points. This method reduces computational load and minimizes long-distance backtracking, enabling more efficient high-frequency planning. Extensive simulations and real world tests show that our method significantly improves exploration efficiency compared to existing vision-based techniques.

### [MapEx: Indoor Structure Exploration with Probabilistic Information Gain from Global Map Predictions]()

Exploration is a critical challenge in robotics, centered on understanding unknown environments. In this work, we focus on structured indoor environments, which often exhibit predictable, repeating patterns. Conventional frontier-based exploration approaches have difficulty leveraging this predictability, relying on simple heuristics such as 'closest first' for exploration. More recent deep learning-based methods predict unknown regions of the map for information gain computation, but these approaches are often sensitive to the predicted map quality or fail to account for sensor coverage. To overcome these issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments on the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than representative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than nearest frontier approach.

### [Ergodic Trajectory Optimization on Generalized Domains Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy]()

We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain

### [Ergodic Exploration Over Meshable Surfaces]()

Robotic search and rescue, exploration, and inspection require trajectory planning across a variety of domains. A popular approach to trajectory planning for these types of missions is ergodic search, which biases a trajectory to spend time in parts of the exploration domain that are believed to contain more information. Most prior work on ergodic search has been limited to searching simple surfaces, like a 2D Euclidean plane or a sphere, as they rely on projecting functions defined on the exploration domain onto analytically obtained Fourier basis functions. In this paper, we extend ergodic search to any surface that can be approximated by a triangle mesh. The basis functions are approximated through finite element methods on a triangle mesh of the domain. We formally prove that this approximation converges to the continuous case as the mesh approximation converges to the true domain. We demonstrate that on domains where analytical basis functions are available (plane, sphere), the proposed method obtains equivalent results, and while on other domains (torus, bunny, wind turbine), the approach is versatile enough to still search effectively. Lastly, we also compare with an existing ergodic search technique that can handle complex domains and show that our method results in a higher quality exploration.

### [FALCON: Fast Autonomous Aerial Exploration Using Coverage Path Guidance]()

This paper introduces FALCON, a novel Fast Autonomous expLoration framework using COverage path guidaNce, which aims at setting a new performance benchmark in the field of autonomous aerial exploration. FALCON effectively harnesses the full potential of online generated coverage paths in enhancing exploration efficiency. The framework begins with an incremental connectivity-aware space decomposition and connectivity graph construction. Subsequently, a hierarchical planner generates a coverage path spanning the entire unexplored space, serving as a global guidance. Then, a local planner optimizes the frontier visitation order, consciously incorporating the intention of the global guidance. For fair and comprehensive benchmark experiments, we introduce a lightweight exploration planner evaluation environment that allows for comparing exploration planners across a variety of testing scenarios using an identical quadrotor simulator. Extensive benchmark experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the significant performance of FALCON. Real-world experiments conducted fully onboard further validate FALCON’s practical capability in complex and challenging environments.

### [Improving Robotic Fruit Harvesting within Cluttered Environments through 3D Shape Completion]()

The world population is increasing and will, by 2050, nearly double its demand for food, feed, fuel, and fiber. Be sides environmental challenges, labor shortage also poses crucial challenges to the agricultural production system. Automation of manual tasks in crop production can potentially increase efficiency but also lead to a change in agricultural practices for more effective usage of available land. In this paper, we address the problem of robotic fruit harvesting in challenging real-world scenarios such as vertical farms, where robotic sensing and acting need to cope with a cluttered environment. Robotic fruit harvesting is typically done by directly detecting a grasp point in the sensor reading, which can lie on the fruit itself or on its peduncle depending on crop harvesting requirements. However, grasp point detection is not always possible as the ideal grasp point may be hidden behind leaves or other fruits. Our approach exploits shape completion techniques allowing us to estimate the complete 3D shape of a target fruit together with its pose even under strong occlusions. In this way, we can estimate a grasp point even when the fruit is only partially visible. We evaluate our approach on a real robotic manipulator operating in a vertical farm growing different fruit species and employing different harvesting tools. Our experiments show that, on average, our proposed pipeline increases the success rate by 18.5 percentage points, in terms of end-effector positioning, compared to the most competitive baseline among the ones reported in this work, that does not rely on shape completion.

### [P-AgSLAM: In-Row and Under-Canopy SLAM for Agricultural Monitoring in Cornfields]()

In this paper, we present an in-row and under-canopy Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework called the Purdue AgSLAM or P-AgSLAM which is designed for robot pose estimation and agricultural monitoring in cornfields. Our SLAM approach is primarily based on a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and it is designed for the extraction of unique morphological features of cornfields which have significantly different characteristics from structured indoor and outdoor urban environments. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated with experiments in simulation and in real cornfield environments. P-AgSLAM outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR-based state estimators in robot pose estimations and mapping.

### [Robotic Mushroom Harvesting with Real2Sim2Real and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Based Planning]()

We present a strategy for the problem of robotic button mushroom harvesting (Agaricus Bisporus) that involves a Real2Sim2Real pipeline with dynamic scene reconstruction and a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control & planning architecture for generating optimal uprooting motion primitives based on a physics engine simulation framework. Given the complex, nonlinear, anisotropic material properties of the mushrooms in combination with the multiple failure-mode modalities involved, we design a simulation framework around the PyBullet rigid-body physics engine by utilizing first-order approximations of the equivalent continuum mechanics models. By exploiting the computational efficiency of the aforementioned simulation framework, we directly apply the MPPI control framework to generate offline optimal mushroom uprooting motion primitives, defining a set of cost objectives for an optimal and within-constraint harvesting plan. We show that with this planning strategy, the ``root-bending'' action emerges autonomously for the single mushroom case as an optimal uprooting maneuver, which corresponds well to empirical knowledge obtained by expert pickers. A video demonstration of the proposed architecture can be found in https://youtu.be/k38ePBsBego.

### [Collision-Aware Traversability Analysis for Autonomous Vehicles in the Context of Agricultural Robotics]()

In this paper, we introduce a novel method for safe navigation in agricultural robotics. As global environmental challenges intensify, robotics offers a powerful solution to reduce chemical usage while meeting the increasing demands for food production. However, significant challenges remain in ensuring the autonomy and resilience of robots operating in unstructured agricultural environments. Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map. Utilizing this map, we compute a physics-based traversability metric that accounts for the robot’s weight and size, ensuring safe navigation over deformable obstacles.

### [Enhanced View Planning for Robotic Harvesting: Tackling Occlusions with Imitation Learning]()

In agricultural automation, inherent occlusion presents a major challenge for robotic harvesting. We propose an imitation learning-based viewpoint planning approach to actively adjust camera viewpoint and capture unobstructed images of the target crop. Traditional viewpoint planners and existing learning-based methods, depend on manually designed evaluation metrics or reward functions, often struggle to generalize to complex, unseen scenarios. Our method employs the Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) algorithm to learn effective camera motion policies from expert demonstrations. This enables continuous six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) viewpoint adjustments that are smoother, more precise and reveal occluded targets. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, featuring agricultural scenarios and a 6-DoF collaborative robot arm equipped with an RGB-D camera, demonstrate our method's superior success rate and efficiency, especially in complex occlusion conditions, as well as its ability to generalize across different crops without reprogramming. This study advances robotic harvesting by providing a practical “learn from demonstration” (LfD) solution to occlusion challenges, ultimately enhancing autonomous harvesting performance and productivity.

### [Precision Harvesting in Cluttered Environments: Integrating End Effector Design with Dual Camera Perception]()

Due to labor shortages in specialty crop industries, a need for robotic automation to increase agricultural efficiency and productivity has arisen. Previous manipulation systems harvest well in uncluttered and structured environments. High tunnel environments are more compact and cluttered in nature, requiring a rethinking of the large form factor systems and grippers. We propose a novel co-designed framework incorporating a global detection camera and a local eye-in-hand camera that demonstrates precise localization of small fruits via closed-loop visual feedback and reliable error handling. Field experiments in high tunnels show that our system can reach 85.0% of cherry tomato fruit in 10.98s on average.

### [S^2BEV: Lightweight, Robust, and Precise SLAM-Oriented Segmentation Bird Eye’s View Mapping Approach]()

As modern agriculture progresses, the swift deployment of accurate maps becomes essential for the autonomous navigation and operation of orchard robots. Traditional mapping techniques often fall short in addressing the challenges posed by orchards, which are characterized by unstructured, dynamically changing environments with complex spatial and temporal dynamics due to seasonal and continuous operations.	This paper proposes a new approach to orchard map construction that merges topological maps with semantic SLAM, which leverages semantic segmentation to discriminate the topological invariant against volatile orchard scenes during mapping.	Meanwhile, this integration enables the creation, optimization, and rapid deployment of maps that are not only lightweight and robust but also precise. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we performed navigation tests in orchard environments using the newly developed maps. The experimental outcomes demonstrated a significant reduction in CPU usage, with maximum and average reductions of 7.6% and 4.5%, respectively. This approach not only enhances navigation efficiency but also facilitates quicker map deployment, effectively freeing computational resources for other critical tasks.

### [Non-Prehensile Object Transport by Nonholonomic Robots Connected by Linear Deformable Elements]()

This paper presents a new method to automatically transport objects with mobile robots via non-prehensile actions. Our proposed approach utilizes a pair of nonholonomic robots connected by a deformable tube to efficiently manipulate objects of irregular shapes toward target locations. To autonomously perform this task, we develop a local integrated planning and control strategy that solves the problem in two steps (viz. enveloping and transport) based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework. The deformable underactuated system is simplified by a linear kinematic model. The enveloping problem is formulated as the minimization of multiple criteria that represent the enclosing error of the object by the variable morphology system. The transport problem is tackled by formulating the non-prehensile dragging action as an inequality constraint specified by the body frame of the deformable system. Reactive obstacle avoidance is ensured by a maximum margin-based term that utilizes the system's geometry and the feedback proximity to the environment. To validate the performance of the proposed methodology, we report a detailed experimental study with vision-guided robotic prototypes conducting multiple autonomous object transport tasks.

### [Implicit Physics-Aware Policy for Dynamic Manipulation of Rigid Objects Via Soft Body Tools]()

Recent advancements in robot tool use have unlocked their usage for novel tasks, yet the predominant focus is on rigid-body tools, while the investigation of soft-body tools and their dynamic interaction with rigid bodies remains unexplored. This paper takes a pioneering step towards dynamic one-shot soft tool use for manipulating rigid objects, a challenging problem posed by complex interactions and unobservable physical properties. To address these problems, we propose the Implicit Physics-aware (IPA) policy, designed to facilitate effective soft tool use across various environmental configurations. The IPA policy conducts system identification to implicitly identify physics information and predict goal-conditioned, one-shot actions accordingly. We validate our approach through a challenging task, i.e., transporting rigid objects using soft tools such as ropes to distant target positions in a single attempt under unknown environment physics parameters. Our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our method in efficiently identifying physical properties, accurately predicting actions, and smoothly generalizing to real-world environments.

### [General-Purpose Clothes Manipulation with Semantic Keypoints]()

Clothes manipulation is a critical capability for household robots; yet, existing methods are often confined to specific tasks, such as folding or flattening, due to the complex high-dimensional geometry of deformable fabric. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP) for general-purpose clothes manipulation, which enables the robot to perform diverse manipulation tasks over different types of clothes. The key idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints---e.g., "right shoulder", "left sleeve", etc.---a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be effectively extracted from depth images and are sufficient to represent a broad range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP leverages semantic keypoints to bridge LLM-powered task planning and low-level action execution in a two-level hierarchy. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms baseline methods across diverse clothes types in both seen and unseen tasks. Further, experiments with a Kinova dual-arm system on four distinct tasks---folding, flattening, hanging, and placing---confirm CLASP's performance on a real robot.

### [Robust Optical Transceiver Manipulation in Cluttered Cable Environments Using 3D Scene Understanding and Planning]()

Robotic manipulation in cluttered environments presents significant challenges, particularly when the clutter includes thin, deformable objects like cables, which complicate perception and decision-making processes. In the context of datacenters, the automation of networking tasks often involves the manipulation of optical transceivers within densely packed cable configurations. Such environments are characterized by an abundance of delicate, overlapping, and intersecting cables, leading to frequent occlusions. This paper introduces an innovative system designed for the manipulation of optical transceivers in environments cluttered by cables. Our integrated approach combines advanced 3D scene understanding with a heuristic-based pushing policy to effectively manipulate optical transceivers amidst clutter. The system's perception component utilizes image segmentation and 3D reconstruction to accurately model the transceivers and surrounding cables. Meanwhile, the planning aspect employs a search algorithm with task-specific heuristics, to navigate the gripper, displace obstructing cables, and safely achieve a precise pre-grasp position in front of the target transceiver. We have conducted extensive evaluations of our methodology in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its high success rates, robustness, and proficiency in addressing the unique challenges posed by cable-occluded environments within datacenters.

### [ReloPush: Multi-Object Rearrangement in Confined Spaces with a Nonholonomic Mobile Robot Pusher]()

We focus on the problem of rearranging a set of objects within a confined space with a nonholonomically constrained mobile robot pusher. This problem is relevant to many real-world domains, including warehouse automation and construction. These domains give rise to instances involving a combination of geometric, kinematic, and physics constraints, which make planning particularly challenging. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions like the use of holonomic mobile robots or dexterous manipulators capable of unconstrained overhand reaching. Our key insight is we can empower even a constrained mobile pusher to tackle complex rearrangement tasks by enabling it to modify the environment to its favor in a constraint-aware fashion. To this end, we describe a Push-Traversability graph, whose vertices represent poses that the pusher can push objects from and edges represent optimal, kinematically feasible, and stable push-rearrangements of objects. Based on this graph, we develop ReloPush, a planning framework that leverages Dubins curves and standard graph search techniques to generate an efficient sequence of object rearrangements to be executed by the pusher. We evaluate ReloPush across a series of challenging scenarios, involving the rearrangement of densely cluttered workspaces with up to eight objects by a 1tenth mobile robot pusher. ReloPush exhibits orders of magnitude faster runtimes and significantly more robust execution in the real world, evidenced in lower execution times and fewer losses of object contact, compared to two baselines lacking our proposed graph structure.

### [Non-Prehensile Shape Manipulation of Elastoplastic Objects with Reinforcement Learning]()

We present a novel framework for non-prehensile shape manipulation of deformable objects using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Unlike previous approaches that rely on grasping, our method employs a sequence of gentle pushing actions to deform objects into target shapes. We introduce a continuous parametrization of pushing actions that allows for precise control over pushing trajectories, enabling more flexible and efficient manipulation. The framework is applicable to a wide range of objects by representing them as sampled boundary coordinates, removing the need for predefined object partitions. Trained entirely in simulation, our controller demonstrates zero-shot transfer to real-world scenarios without additional training. Extensive evaluations show that our approach not only matches but substantially exceeds the performance of previous methods, while being more gentle and efficient. We demonstrate successful manipulation across various deformable objects and materials, including food items like salmon and pork loin. This work represents a significant advancement in robotic manipulation of deformable objects, with potential applications in food processing, manufacturing, and beyond.

### [ORLA*: Mobile Manipulator-Based Object Rearrangement with Lazy A*]()

Effectively performing object rearrangement is an essential skill for mobile manipulators, e.g., setting up a dinner table. A key challenge in such problems is deciding an appropriate ordering to effectively untangle object-object dependencies while considering the necessary motions for realizing manipulation tasks (e.g., pick and place). Computing time-optimal multi-object rearrangement solutions for mobile manipulators remains a largely untapped research direction. In this work, we propose ORLA*, which leverages delayed/lazy evaluation in searching for a high-quality object pick-n-place sequence that considers both end-effector and mobile robot base travel. ORLA* readily handles multi-layered rearrangement tasks powered by learning-based stability predictions. Employing an optimal solver for finding temporary locations for displacing objects, ORLA* can achieve global optimality. Through extensive simulation and ablation study, we confirm the effectiveness of ORLA* delivering quality solutions for challenging rearrangement instances. Supplementary materials are available at: https://gaokai15.github.io/ORLA-Star/

### [Learning Prehensile Dexterity by Imitating and Emulating State-Only Observations]()

When human acquire physical skills (e.g., tennis) from experts, we tend to first learn from merely observing the expert. But this is often insufficient. We then engage in practice, where we try to emulate the expert and ensure that our actions produce similar effects on our environment. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Combining IMitation and Emulation for Motion Refinement (CIMER) -- a two-stage framework to learn dexterous prehensile manipulation skills from state-only observations. CIMER's first stage involves imitation: simultaneously encode the complex interdependent motions of the robot hand and the object in a structured dynamical system. This results in a reactive motion generation policy that provides a reasonable motion prior, but lacks the ability to reason about contact effects due to the lack of action labels. The second stage involves emulation: learn a motion refinement policy via reinforcement that adjusts the robot hand's motion prior such that the desired object motion is reenacted. CIMER is both task-agnostic (no task-specific reward design or shaping) and intervention-free (no additional teleoperated or labeled demonstrations). Detailed experiments with prehensile dexterity reveal that i) imitation alone is insufficient, but adding emulation drastically improves performance, ii) CIMER outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency and the ability to generate realistic and stable motions, iii) CIMER can either zero-shot generalize or learn to adapt to novel objects from the YCB dataset, even outperforming expert policies trained with action labels in most cases. Source code and videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/cimer-2024/.

### [EgoMimic: Scaling Imitation Learning Via Egocentric Video]()

The scale and diversity of demonstration data required for imitation learning is a significant challenge. We present EgoMimic, a full-stack framework that scales manipulation through egocentric-view human demonstrations. EgoMimic achieves this through: (1) an ergonomic human data collection system using the Project Aria glasses, (2) a low-cost bimanual manipulator that minimizes the kinematic gap to human data, (3) cross-domain data alignment techniques, and (4) an imitation learning architecture that co-trains on hand and robot data. Compared to prior works that only extract high-level intent from human videos, our approach treats human and robot data equally as embodied demonstration data and learns a unified policy from both data sources. EgoMimic achieves significant improvement on a diverse set of long-horizon, single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art imitation learning methods and enables generalization to entirely new scenes. Finally, we show a favorable scaling trend for EgoMimic, where adding 1 hour of additional hand data is significantly more valuable than 1 hour of additional robot data. Videos and additional information can be found at https://egomimic.github.io/.

### [Neural Dynamics Augmented Diffusion Policy]()

Imitation learning has been proven effective in mimicking demonstrations across various robotic manipulation tasks. However, to develop robust policies, current imitation methods, such as diffusion policy, require training on extensive demonstrations, making data collection labor-intensive. In contrast, model-based planning with dynamics models can effectively cover a sufficient range of configurations using only off-policy data. Yet, without the guidance of expert demonstrations, many tasks are difficult and time-consuming to plan using the dynamics models. Therefore, we take the best of both model learning and imitation learning, and propose neural dynamics augmented imitation learning that covers a large scene configurations with few-shot demonstrations. This method trains a robust diffusion policy in a local support region using few-shot demonstrations and rearranges objects outside this region into it using offline-trained neural dynamics models. Extensive experiments across various tasks in both simulations and real-world scenarios, including granular manipulation, contact-rich task and multi-object interaction task, have demonstrated that trained with only 1 to 30 demonstrations, our proposed method can robustly cover a significantly larger area than the policy trained purely from the demonstrations. Our project page is available at: https://dynamics-dp.github.io/.

### [CAGE: Causal Attention Enables Data-Efficient Generalizable Robotic Manipulation]()

Generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly when scaling to new environments with limited demonstrations. This paper introduces CAGE, a novel robotic manipulation policy designed to overcome these generalization barriers by integrating the pre-trained visual representation with causal attention mechanism. CAGE utilizes the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the vision foundation model DINOv2, combined with LoRA fine-tuning for robust environment understanding. The policy further employs a causal perceiver for effective token compression and a diffusion-based action head with attention to enhance task-specific fine-grained conditioning. With as few as 50 demonstrations from a single training environment, CAGE achieves robust generalization across diverse visual changes in objects, backgrounds, and viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate that CAGE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art RGB/RGB-D-based approaches in various manipulation tasks, especially under large distribution shifts. In similar environments, CAGE offers an average of 42% increase in task completion rate. While all baselines fail in unseen environments, CAGE manages to obtain a 43% completion rate and a 51% success rate in average, marking a substantial advancement toward the practical deployment of robots in real-world settings.

### [RoCoDA: Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Data-Efficient Robot Learning from Demonstrations]()

Imitation learning in robotics faces significant challenges in generalization due to the complexity of robotic environments and the high cost of data collection. We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of invariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance data augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by modifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting the policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying rigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions to generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive experiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in policy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust generalization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of distractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping, indicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task dynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA provides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning, bridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.

### [Conditional Neural Expert Processes for Learning Movement Primitives from Demonstration]()

Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a widely used technique for skill acquisition in robotics. However, demonstrations of the same skill may exhibit significant variances, or learning systems may attempt to acquire different means of the same skill simultaneously, making it challenging to encode these motions into movement primitives. To address these challenges, we propose an LfD framework, namely the Conditional Neural Expert Processes (CNEP), that learns to assign demonstrations from different modes to distinct expert networks utilizing the inherent information within the latent space to match experts with the encoded representations. CNEP does not require supervision on which mode the trajectories belong to. We compare the performance of CNEP against widely used and powerful LfD methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models, Probabilistic Movement Primitives, and Stable Movement Primitives and show that our method outperforms these baselines on multimodal trajectory datasets. The results reveal enhanced modeling performance for movement primitives, leading to the synthesis of trajectories that more accurately reflect those demonstrated by experts, particularly when the skill demonstrations include intersection points from various trajectories. We evaluated the CNEP model on two real-robot tasks, namely obstacle avoidance and pick-and-place tasks, that require the robot to learn multi-modal motion trajectories and execute the correct primitives given target environment conditions. We also showed that our system is capable of on-the-fly adaptation to environmental changes via an online conditioning mechanism. Lastly, we believe that CNEP offers improved explainability and interpretability by autonomously finding discrete behavior primitives and providing probability values about its expert selection decisions.

### [PRIME: Scaffolding Manipulation Tasks with Behavior Primitives for Data-Efficient Imitation Learning]()

Imitation learning has shown great potential for enabling robots to acquire complex manipulation behaviors. However, these algorithms suffer from high sample complexity in long-horizon tasks, where compounding errors accumulate over the task horizons. We present PRIME (PRimitive-based IMitation with data Efficiency), a behavior primitive-based framework designed for improving the data efficiency of imitation learning. PRIME scaffolds robot tasks by decomposing task demonstrations into primitive sequences, followed by learning a high-level control policy to sequence primitives through imitation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that PRIME achieves a significant performance improvement in multi-stage manipulation tasks, with 10-34% higher success rates in simulation over state-of-the-art baselines and 20-48% on physical hardware.

### [Towards Dense and Accurate Radar Perception Via Efficient Cross-Modal Diffusion Model]()

Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry due to their capability to operate in extreme weather conditions. However, they face challenges in terms of sparsity and noise interference, which hinder their application in the field of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) autonomous navigation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to dense and accurate mmWave radar point cloud construction via cross-modal learning. Specifically, we introduce diffusion models, which possess state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, to predict LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We also incorporate the most recent diffusion model inference accelerating techniques to ensure that the proposed method can be implemented on MAVs. We validate the proposed method through extensive benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and generalization ability. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Radar-Diffusion.

### [DiffMap: Enhancing Map Segmentation with Map Prior Using Diffusion Model]()

Constructing high-definition (HD) maps is a crucial requirement for enabling autonomous driving. In recent years, several map segmentation algorithms have been developed to address this need, leveraging advancements in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perception. However, existing models still encounter challenges in producing realistic and consistent semantic map layouts. One prominent issue is the limited utilization ofstructured priors inherent in map segmentation masks. In light of this, we propose DiffMap, a novel approach specifically designed to model the structured priors of map segmentation masks usinglatent diffusion model. By incorporating this technique, the performance of existing semantic segmentation methods can be significantly enhanced and certain structural errors present in the segmentation outputs can be effectively rectified. Notably, the proposed module can be seamlessly integrated into any map segmentation model, thereby augmenting its capability to accurately delineate semantic information. Furthermore, through extensive visualization analysis, our model demonstrates superior proficiency in generating results that more accurately reflect real-world map layouts, further validating its efficacy in improving the quality of the generated maps.

### [AVD2: Accident Video Diffusion for Accident Video Description]()

Traffic accidents present complex challenges for autonomous driving, often creating unpredictable scenarios that hinder accurate system interpretation and responses. Therefore, understanding accident scenarios is crucial for improving safety and gaining public trust. However, current methods struggle to fully explain accident causes and preventive actions. In this work, we introduce AVD2 (Accident Video Diffusion for Accident Video Description), a novel framework that enhances accident scene understanding by generating detailed natural language descriptions and reasoning. Additionally, we propose a new approach for augmenting accident video datasets by generating accident videos with a customized diffusion model, resulting in the EMM-AU (Enhanced Multi-Modal Accident Video Understanding) dataset, a higher-quality, more diverse version of MM-AU. Experimental results demonstrate that using the AVD2 system and training on the EMM-AU dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automated metrics and human evaluations, significantly advancing accident analysis and prevention.

### [LDM-ISP: Enhancing Neural ISP for Low Light with Latent Diffusion Models]()

Enhancing a low-light noisy RAW image into a well-exposed and clean sRGB image is a significant challenge for modern digital cameras. Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

### [SteeredMarigold: Steering Diffusion towards Depth Completion of Largely Incomplete Depth Maps]()

Even if the depth maps captured by RGB-D sensors deployed in real environments are often characterized by large areas missing valid depth measurements, the vast majority of depth completion methods still assumes depth values covering all areas of the scene. To address this limitation, we introduce SteeredMarigold, a training-free, zero-shot depth completion method capable of producing metric dense depth, even for largely incomplete depth maps. SteeredMarigold achieves this by using the available sparse depth points as conditions to steer a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. Our method outperforms relevant top-performing methods on the NYUv2 dataset, in tests where no depth was provided for a large area, achieving state-of-art performance and exhibiting remarkable robustness against depth map incompleteness. Our source code is publicly available at https://steeredmarigold.github.io.

### [DualDiff: Dual-Branch Diffusion Model for Autonomous Driving with Semantic Fusion]()

Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction relies on fully leveraging scene information as conditioning. However, existing approaches, which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects. DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object detection tasks.

### [Anomalies-By-Synthesis: Anomaly Detection Using Generative Diffusion Models for Off-Road Navigation]()

In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of- distribution (OOD) with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation models to compare pixels between the original and synthesized images in a learned feature space and detect semantically meaningful edits. Our diffusion-based analysis-by-synthesis method enables accurate anomaly detections for off-road navigation.

### [EHC-MM: Embodied Holistic Control for Mobile Manipulation]()

Mobile manipulation typically entails the base for mobility, the arm for accurate manipulation, and the camera for perception. The principle of Distant Mobility, Close Grasping(DMCG) is essential for holistic control. We propose Embodied Holistic Control for Mobile Manipulation(EHC-MM) with the embodied function of sig(w): By formulating the DMCG principle as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, sig(w) dynamically balances the robot’s emphasis between movement and manipulation with the consideration of the robot's state and environment. In addition, we propose the Monitor-Position-Based Servoing(MPBS) with sig(w), enabling the tracking of the target during the operation. This approach enables coordinated control among the robot's base, arm, and camera, enhancing task efficiency. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, our approach significantly improves both the success rate and efficiency of mobile manipulation tasks, achieving a 95.6% success rate in real-world scenarios and a 52.8% increase in time efficiency.

### [BUMBLE: Unifying Reasoning and Acting with Vision-Language Models for Building-Wide Mobile Manipulation]()

To operate at a building scale, service robots must perform long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks by navigating to different rooms, accessing multiple floors, and interacting with a wide and unseen range of everyday objects. We refer to these tasks as Building-wide Mobile Manipulation. To tackle these inherently long-horizon tasks, we introduce BUMBLE, a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework integrating open-world RGB-D perception, a wide spectrum of gross-to-fine motor skills, and dual-layered memory. Our extensive evaluation (90+ hours) indicates that BUMBLE outperforms competitive baselines in long-horizon building-wide tasks that require sequencing up to 12 skills, spanning 15 minutes per trial. BUMBLE achieves 47.1% success rate averaged over 70 trials in different buildings, tasks, and scene layouts from various starting locations. Our user study shows 22% higher task satisfaction using our framework compared to state-of-the-art VLM-based mobile manipulation methods. Finally, we show the potential of using increasingly capable foundation models to improve the system performance further. For more information, see https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/BUMBLE/

### [DynaMem: Online Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Memory for Open World Mobile Manipulation]()

Significant progress has been made in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where the goal is for a robot to perform tasks in any environment given a natural language description. However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system’s applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot’s own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot’s environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, a 3X improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

### [Whole-Body Model Predictive Control for Mobile Manipulation with Task Priority Transition]()

Mobile manipulators enable a wide range of operations with mobility and advanced manipulation capabilities. Despite their potential, existing approaches typically treat the mobile base and the manipulator separately, thereby limiting the optimality of the system for composite whole-body behaviors. In this work, we present a Whole-Body Model Predictive Control framework for mobile manipulation involving tasks with varying timelines. We integrate task priorities across both task and time dimensions, bringing inherent transition ability with enhanced performance. Our approach improves the trajectory tracking performance by up to 36% in terms of manipulability and reduces the maximum velocity during task priority transitions by 53% compared to the existing approach while maintaining a low computational cost of 4.3ms, allowing for high reactivity in real-world applications. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a door-opening and traversing behavior, showcasing the first successful implementation of a non-holonomic mobile manipulator in such a scenario. See https://wbmpc.github.io/ for supplemental materials.

### [Dynamic Object Goal Pushing with Mobile Manipulators through Model-Free Constrained Reinforcement Learning]()

Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.

### [Door-To-Door Parcel Delivery from Supply Point to Users Home with Heterogeneous Robot Team: EuROBIN First Year Robotics Hackathon]()

Logistics and service operations involving parcel preparation, delivery, and unpacking from a supply point to the user's home could be carried out completely by robots in the near future, taking benefit of the capabilities of the different robot morphologies for the logistics, outdoors, and domestic environments. The use of robots for parcel delivery can contribute to the goals of sustainability and reduced emissions by exploiting the different locomotion modalities (wheeled, legged, and aerial). This paper reports the development and results obtained from the first robotics hackathon celebrated as part of the European Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Network (euROBIN) involving eight robotic platforms in three domains: 1) an industrial robotic arm for parcel preparation at the supply point, 2) a Centauro robot, a dual-arm aerial manipulator, and a wheeled-legged quadruped for parcel transportation, and 3) two humanoid robots and two commercial mobile manipulators for parcel delivery and unpacking in domestic scenarios. The paper describes the joint operation and the evaluation scenario, the features and capabilities of the robots, particularly those involved in the realization of the tasks, and the lessons learned.

### [HSRL: A Hierarchical Control System Based on Spiking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation]()

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in robotic navigation tasks, yet applying it to real-world environments remains challenging due to dynamic complexities and the need for dynamically feasible actions. We propose a hierarchical control framework based on Spiking Deep Reinforcement Learning (SDRL) for robust robot navigation in real environments. Our approach utilizes a two-layer architecture: a high-level decision layer powered by a Spiking GRU network for handling partially observable environments, and a low-level executive layer employing Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) to ensure precise and continuous actions. This hierarchical structure allows real-time decision-making that respects the physical constraints of the robot. Experimental results show that our method adapts effectively to new environments without fine-tuning and surpasses existing methods in performance. We also explore the implementation on the Darwin3 chip, paving the way for biologically inspired motion control in future robotic applications.

### [Materials Matter: Investigating Functional Advantages of Bio-Inspired Materials Via Simulated Robotic Hopping]()

In contrast with the diversity of materials found in nature, most robots are designed with some combination of aluminum, stainless steel, and 3D-printed filament. Additionally, robotic systems are typically assumed to follow basic rigid-body dynamics. However, several examples in nature illustrate how changes in physical material properties yield functional advantages. In this paper, we explore how physical materials (non-rigid bodies) affect the functional performance of a hopping robot. In doing so, we address the practical question of how to model and simulate material properties. Through these simulations we demonstrate that material gradients in the leg of a single-limb hopper provide functional advantages compared to homogeneous designs. For example, when considering incline ramp hopping, a material gradient with increasing density provides a 35% reduction in tracking error and a 23% reduction in power consumption compared to homogeneous stainless steel. By providing bio-inspiration to the rigid limbs in a robotic system, we seek to show that future fabrication of robots should look to leverage the material anisotropies of moduli and density found in nature. This would allow for reduced vibrations in the system and would provide offsets of joint torques and vibrations while protecting their structural integrity against reduced fatigue and wear. This simulation system could inspire future intelligent material gradients of custom-fabricated robotic locomotive devices.

### [SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency Using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning]()

The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25−78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.

### [Hyperdimensional Computing-Based Federated Learning in Mobile Robots through Synthetic Oversampling]()

Traditional federated learning frameworks, often reliant on deep neural networks, face challenges related to computational demands and privacy risks. In this paper, we present a novel Hyperdimensional (HD) Computing-based federated learning framework designed for resource-constrained mobile robots. Unlike other HD-based learning, our approach introduces dynamic encoding, which improves both model accuracy and privacy by continuously updating hypervector representations. To further address the issue of imbalanced data, especially prevalent in robotics tasks, we propose a hypervector oversampling technique, enhancing model robustness. Extensive evaluations on LiDAR-equipped mobile robots demonstrate that our oversampling method outperforms state-of-the-art HD computing frameworks, achieving up to a 22.9% increase in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and privacy protection.

### [Brain-Inspired Spatial Continuous State Encoding for Efficient Spiking-Based Navigation]()

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) show great potential in mapless navigation tasks due to their low power consumption, but the continuous representation of spatial information poses a challenge to SNN training. Neuroscience findings reveal that spatial cognition cells encode spatial information through population spike patterns. Inspired by this, we propose a navigation method based on SNNs, leveraging spatial cognition cells, which include grid cells (GCs), head direction cells (HDCs), and boundary vector cells (BVCs). Our method integrates spike-based information to achieve precise navigation goal encoding and egocentric environment perception, significantly improving SNN navigation capabilities in complex environments. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in navigation success rate and energy efficiency, showcasing superior adaptability across environments. Our work provides a novel approach to developing efficient brain-inspired navigation systems.

### [A Rapid Adapting and Continual Learning Spiking Neural Network Path Planning Algorithm for Mobile Robots]()

Mapping traversal costs in an environment and planning paths based on this map are important for autonomous navigation. We present a neurorobotic navigation system that utilizes a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Wavefront Planner and E-prop learning to concurrently map and plan paths in a large and complex environment. We incorporate a novel method for mapping which, when combined with the Spiking Wavefront Planner (SWP), allows for adaptive planning by selectively considering any combination of costs. The system is tested on a mobile robot platform in an outdoor environment with obstacles and varying terrain. Results indicate that the system is capable of discerning features in the environment using three measures of cost, (1) energy expenditure by the wheels, (2) time spent in the presence of obstacles, and (3) terrain slope. In just twelve hours of online training, E-prop learns and incorporates traversal costs into the path planning maps by updating the delays in the SWP. On simulated paths, the SWP plans significantly shorter and lower cost paths than A* and RRT*. The SWP is compatible with neuromorphic hardware and could be used for applications requiring low size, weight, and power.

### [LuVo: Lunar Visual Odometry Using Homography-Based Image Feature Matching]()

We present LuVo, an initialization-free stereo visual odometry (VO) method developed for the VIPER lunar rover. We provide a novel stereo registration method using LightGlue image feature matching in a warped, locally planar space that improves matching robustness to larger baseline stereo sequences and repetitive terrain that traditionally challenge odometry approaches. We additionally introduce methods that increase the usable image region for matching by estimating a horizon cutoff in image space and enhance robustness to stereo correspondence failures using a Manhattan distance search for valid stereo points during cloud alignment. We evaluate the performance of LuVo on a dataset of 155 simulated lunar stereo sequences and show that it significantly improves registration accuracy and success rates for clouds separated by both expected driving ranges below eight meters and longer distance translations of up to 16 meters. While LuVo is developed for VIPER, it can be used in other environments featuring slip-prone and repetitive terrain that limit rover travel.

### [Instance Segmentation-Based Hazard Detection with Lunar South Pole Lighting]()

This paper addresses rock hazard detection for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) robotic navigation in the challenging visual environment of the lunar south pole (LSP). We evaluate three state-of-the-art instance segmentation models—Mask~R-CNN, YOLOv8, and SAM—using a novel, synthetically generated dataset that simulates LSP-specific illumination challenges at sun angles of 2.5°, 5°, and 7.5°. Additionally, we evaluate these approaches in both up and down-sun driving with low solar angle light. This study highlights the potential of deep learning-based approaches for improving ISRU operations by reliably identifying visual surface hazards, such as rocks, which may impede robotic navigation and excavation in future lunar missions.

### [Resettable Land Anchor Launcher for Unmanned Rover Rescue and Slope Climbing]()

Unmanned planetary rovers have traversed kilometers of Lunar and Martian terrain while performing valuable science. However, they still face mobility challenges including steep slopes and unstable soil that can entrap vehicles, as demonstrated by NASA’s Spirit rover. Vehicles on Earth can depend on a human operator or rescue vehicle to tow them out of an entrapment, but remote rovers cannot, limiting their route to highly conservative path selections. To increase rover mobility on slopes and unstable soils, we present a resettable anchor launcher for independent self-rescue. The device launches a tethered land anchor away from the rover and then uses a winch to tow the rover up a hill or out of an entrapment. This paper presents the design of the launcher and its integration into a half-meter-long rover mobility platform with field testing at the NASA Glenn Research Center SLOPE Lab. We demonstrate repeatable launching and winching to help the rover climb a 17° slope of loose GRC-1 Lunar regolith simulant that it otherwise could not climb. Our work presents an alternative method to increase rover mobility, especially up slopes, and enables independent rover rescue, which could eventually increase mission duration and reduce risk of entrapment during extraterrestrial exploration.

### [SOF-E: An Energy Efficient Robot for Collaborative Transport and Placement of Mechanical Meta-Material Modules]()

In-space assembly is a key capability to enable construction of large-scale structures required for sustained human presence in space. Robotic assembly is critical to reduce required crew time and risk, while modularity ensures that solutions are versatile and adaptive to complex mission concepts. NASA’s Automated Reconfigurable Mission Adaptive Digital Assembly Systems (ARMADAS) project demonstrated that robots with relatively low cost, size, and degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) can be used for large-scale modular lattice structure assembly. This is possible by using the structural modules for robotic systems metrology and error mitigation. Robots with reduced complexity may lead to advantages in initial and maintenance cost, offering an alternative to large, complex, and expensive robots. In this paper, we describe the Structure Omni-directional Foldable Explorer (SOF-E), a robot with significantly lower mass and DoF compared to the previous ARMADAS robot architecture. Although SOF-E is a five DoF robot with only two or three control states per actuator, it is capable of transporting and placing structural modules by collaborating with other instances of itself. We discuss the mechanical design and architecture of SOF-E, including analysis of energy usage during each operation. Experiments demonstrate that during locomotion and module transport tasks, SOF-E requires significantly lower energy than the previous cargo transport robot architecture, the Scaling Omni-directional Lattice Locomoting Explorer (SOLL-E). The cost of transport metric is used to compare the energy efficiency of the operation.

### [Quarry-Bot: A Reconfigurable Cable-Suspended Robot for Lunar Site Engineering]()

This paper introduces Quarry-Bot, a Reconfigurable Cable-Suspended Robot developed to support the NASA Artemis program’s efforts in preparing for the long-term colonization of the Moon and Mars. Quarry-Bot autonomously clears debris on the lunar surface, a key step in site preparation for future habitats and infrastructure. The system utilizes active control strategies, combined with the Moon’s lower gravity, to perform underhand rock tosses as a scalable approach to extraterrestrial site preparation. Its reconfigurable structure, including motorized anchor points and a lightweight tripod design, adjusts cable tensions to generate swing motions for debris displacement. The system is driven by two Dynamixel MX-106 motors for movement and steering, along with a NEMA 17 stepper motor for cable adjustments. A decentralized control system, managed by Raspberry Pi units, coordinates these components. Simulations and experiments conducted under both Earth and lunar gravity conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies in achieving rock throws. Quarry-Bot reaches swing angles and projects rocks over distances that may support lunar site clearing and overall engineering purposes. The paper concludes by discussing potential areas for further system refinement, including adjustments for different terrain conditions and im- proved actuation strategies for lunar missions.

### [A Tugging Controller That Maximizes Lateral Resistive Force by Mounding Sandy Terrain]()

Sandy environments present challenges for robotic space rovers and systems due to reduced traction, limiting mobility and tugging force. This paper presents an anchoring method that utilizes a winching system to create a sand mound in front of a mobile agent dragged through the media. The proposed controller is designed to consistently achieve real-time capture of close-to-maximal lateral sand mound resistive force, even when applied to varied uneven terrains, like holes or waves. Notably, tugging is non-reversible, so suitable peaks should be captured before breakdown and without necessarily knowing the global optimum a priori. The controller logic tracks both tugging force and agent pitch gradients to detect terrain conditions and peak force trends. Results show that the controller captures an average 92% of the maximum forces, within the previously winched workspace tested, across three different granular media with four varying structured terrain features. The controller achieves higher resistive force peaks on terrains with geometric features, as opposed to flat sand. We conclude that sand mounding through tugging is a viable means to generate robotic resistive forces for unknown sandy terrains, a simple yet effective anchoring mechanism.

### [RMSeg-UDA: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Road Marking Segmentation under Adverse Conditions]()

The segmentation of road markings plays a crucial role in visual perception for the autonomous driving system. It enables vehicles to recognize road markings at the pixel-level, and facilitates subsequent path planning, localization, and map construction tasks. Current techniques mainly focus on normal driving scenes (i.e., clear daytime), and the performance would decrease significantly for adverse weather conditions. This work proposes RMSeg-UDA: an unsupervised domain adaptive road marking segmentation framework. By combining schedule self- training and class-conditioned adversarial training, the network utilizes both labeled normal data and unlabeled data from other domains to train a road marking segmentation model. For the evaluation on adverse conditions, a new image dataset, RLMD- AC, is established with rainy and nighttime driving scenes. The experiments conducted using both public and our datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/stu9113611/RM Seg-UDA.

### [Enhancing the Utilization of Color Information in Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation]()

Point cloud semantic segmentation is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality, aiming to assign labels to each point in a cloud to reflect spatial relationships and boundaries. While previous methods primarily focus on geometric features, they often overlook the auxiliary role of color information, especially in scenes where geometric structures are less distinct. In this paper, we propose the Color Point Cloud Enhancement (CPCE) method to effectively leverage color information for improved 3D scene understanding. CPCE introduces a color information enhancement module with multi-scale consistency, enriching point features throughout the encoder stages. Additionally, we develop a novel contrastive learning module that uses relative color coordinates for point cloud serialization, allowing for the capture of positive and negative samples from distant points with similar color textures. Furthermore, we design a contrastive learning module tailored for scenes with weak geometric structures, enhancing feature representation through color-augmented contrast. Our method achieved a 78.1% mIoU on the ScanNet dataset, outperforming existing models trained on a single dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of CPCE in scenarios where traditional methods struggle, particularly in enhancing segmentation accuracy by utilizing color as a critical feature.

### [UltraFastCrackSeg: A Lightweight Real-Time Crack Segmentation Model with Task-Oriented Pretraining]()

Crack segmentation is pivotal for structural health monitoring, enabling the timely maintenance of critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads. However, existing deep learning models are often too computationally intensive for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we introduce UltraFastCrackSeg, a lightweight model designed for real-time crack segmentation that effectively balances high accuracy with low computational demands. Featuring an efficient encoder-decoder architecture, our model significantly reduces parameter count and floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to current methods. We further enhance performance through a self-supervised pretraining approach that employs a novel, task-oriented masking strategy, thereby improving feature extraction. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that UltraFastCrackSeg achieves state-of-the-art Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 scores while maintaining a compact model size and high inference speed. Evaluations on a low-power CPU device confirm its capability to achieve up to 80 frames per second (FPS) with ONNX runtime optimization, making it highly suitable for real-time, on-site applications. These findings establish UltraFastCrackSeg as a robust and efficient solution for practical crack detection tasks.

### [Enhancing 3D Scene Graphs with Real-Time Room Classification]()

In recent years, 3D scene graphs have become a critical tool in robotics and computer vision for enabling systems to understand both the geometric and semantic aspects of their surroundings. These data structures represent spatial and semantic relationships between objects in a three-dimensional environment, supporting tasks like navigation, object manipulation, and scene understanding. This paper presents a real-time pipeline for 3D scene graph generation that offers flexibility in image segmentation techniques while incorporating room classification that is based on a Random Forest model. Our work enables robots to dynamically update their understanding of complex and large-scale environments in real-time. We evaluate our approach systematically on a dataset and in a real-life experiment. The results demonstrate the capability of running our solution at over 10 Hz on an Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin SoC while also scaling favorably in larger environments. Our proposed room classification approach predicts classes with an average accuracy of 80%.

Moreover, by employing a lightweight MLP-based point decoder, our method eliminates the need to upsample redundant points from past frames. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets show that MFSeg outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

### [A Good Foundation Is Worth Many Labels: Label-Efficient Panoptic Segmentation]()

A key challenge for the widespread application of learning-based models for robotic perception is to significantly reduce the required amount of annotated training data while achieving accurate predictions. This is essential not only to decrease operating costs but also to speed up deployment time. In this work, we address this challenge for PAnoptic SegmenTation with fEw Labels (PASTEL) by exploiting the groundwork paved by visual foundation models. We leverage descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous driving and agricultural robotics. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PASTEL significantly outperforms previous methods for label-efficient segmentation even when using fewer annotations. The code of our work is publicly available at https://pastel.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [CE-MRS: Contrastive Explanations for Multi-Robot Systems]()

As the complexity of multi-robot systems grows to incorporate a greater number of robots, more complex tasks, and longer time horizons, the solutions to such problems often become too complex to be fully intelligible to human users. In this work, we introduce an approach for generating natural language explanations that justify the validity of the system's solution to the user, or else aid the user in correcting any errors that led to a suboptimal system solution. Toward this goal, we first contribute a generalizable formalism of contrastive explanations for multi-robot systems, and then introduce a holistic approach to generating contrastive explanations for multi-robot scenarios that selectively incorporates data from multi-robot task allocation, scheduling, and motion-planning to explain system behavior. Through user studies with human operators we demonstrate that our integrated contrastive explanation approach leads to significant improvements in user ability to identify and solve system errors, leading to significant improvements in overall multi-robot team performance.

### [Affordance-Based Explanations of Robot Navigation]()

This paper introduces affordance-based explanations of robot navigational decisions. The rationale behind affordance-based explanations draws on the theory of affordances, a principle rooted in ecological psychology that describes potential actions the objects in the environment offer to the robot. We demonstrate how affordances can be incorporated into visual and textual explanations for common robot navigation and path-planning scenarios. Furthermore, we formalize and categorize the concept of affordance-based explanations and connect it to existing explanation types in robotics. We present the results of a user study that shows participants to be, on average, highly satisfied with visual-textual, i.e., multimodal, affordance-based explanations of robot navigation. Furthermore, we investigate the complexity of different types of textual affordance-based explanations. Our research contributes to the expanding domain of explainable robotics, focusing on explaining robot actions in navigation.

### [Explainable Reinforcement Learning Via Dynamic Mixture Policies]()

Learning control policies using deep reinforcement learning has shown great success for a variety of applications, including robotics and automated driving. A key area limiting the adaptation of RL in the real world is the lack of trust in the decision-making process of such policies. Therefore, explainability is a requirement of any RL agent operating in the real world. In this work, we propose a family of control policies that are explainable-by-design regarding individual observation components on object-based scene representations. By estimating diagonal squashed Gaussian and categorical mixture distributions on sub-spaces of the decomposed observations, we develop stochastic policies with easy-to-read explanations of the decision-making process. Our design is generally applicable to any RL algorithm using stochastic policies. We showcase the explainability on an extensive suite of single- and multi-agent simulations, set- and sequence-based high-level scenes, and discrete and continuous action spaces, with performance at least on-par or better compared to standard policy architectures. In additional experiments, we analyze the robustness of our approach to its single additional hyper-parameter and examine its potential for very low computational requirements with tiny policies.

### [3D Spatial Understanding in MLLMs: Disambiguation and Evaluation]()

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in tasks such as image captioning and question answering. However, while these models can generate realistic captions, they often struggle with providing precise instructions, particularly when it comes to localizing and disambiguating objects in complex 3D environments. This capability is critical as MLLMs become more integrated with collaborative robotic systems. In scenarios where a target object is surrounded by similar objects (distractors), robots must deliver clear, spatially-aware instructions to guide humans effectively. We refer to this challenge as contextual object localization and disambiguation, which imposes stricter constraints than conventional 3D dense captioning, especially regarding ensuring target exclusivity. In response, we propose simple yet effective techniques to enhance the model's ability to localize and disambiguate target objects. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional metrics that evaluate sentence similarity, but also demonstrates improved 3D spatial understanding through 3D visual grounding model.

### [Towards Transparent Multi-Agent Autonomous Systems through Principled Multi-Source Knowledge Distillation]()

Many real-world robotic applications can be formulated as Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) problems and approximated using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms. However, the opaque nature of the black-box neural network models employed by MARL algorithms has impeded their widespread adoption due to concerns over interpretability, debugging, and user trust.To address these limitations, we propose an interpretable MAPF framework that emulates a group of n path-finding agents optimized through reinforcement learning (RL) using behavior trees (BTs), where n is the number of agents in path-finding scenarios. Expert behavior datasets consisting of state-action trajectories from MARL algorithms are generated, and a knowledge distillation approach is employed to reduce the size of the datasets and extract implicit rules.Additionally, a principled rules factorization technique based on Boolean algebra theory is utilized to prune the behavior rules and create more compact BTs representations.The proposed framework is evaluated on randomly generated MAPF scenarios and demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BTs generation methods. This paper advances the field of interpretable AI by enabling the extraction of understandable decision-making processes from complex reinforcement learning models in multi-agent systems.

### [Through the Clutter: Exploring the Impact of Complex Environments on the Legibility of Robot Motion]()

The environments in which the collaboration of a robot would be the most helpful to a person are frequently uncontrolled and cluttered with many objects present. Legible robot arm motion is crucial in tasks like these in order to avoid possible collisions, improve the workflow and help ensure the safety of the person. Prior work in this area, however, focuses on solutions that are tested only in uncluttered environments and there are not many results taken from cluttered environments. In this research we present a measure for clutteredness based on an entropic measure of the environment, and a novel motion planner based on potential fields. Both our measure and the planner were tested in a cluttered environment meant to represent a more typical tool-sorting task for which the person would collaborate with a robot. The in-person validation study with Baxter robots shows a significant improvement in legibility of our proposed legible motion planner compared to the current state-of-the-art legible motion planner in cluttered environments. Further, the results show a significant difference in the performance of the planners in cluttered and uncluttered environments, and the need to further explore legible motion in cluttered environments. We argue that the inconsistency of our results in cluttered environments with those obtained from uncluttered environments points out several important issues with the current research performed in the area of legible motion planners.

### [OpenSU3D: Open World 3D Scene Understanding Using Foundation Models]()

In this paper, we present a novel, scalable approach for constructing open set, instance-level 3D scene representations, advancing open world understanding of 3D environments. Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature representation, additionally struggle with contextual queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, and efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.

### [Task-Aware Semantic Map: Autonomous Robot Task Assignment Beyond Commands]()

With recent advancements in Large Language Models, task planning methods that interpret human commands have garnered significant attention. However, as home robots become more common, specifying every daily task could become impractical. This paper introduces a novel semantic map called the Task-Aware Semantic Map (TASMap), which enables robots to autonomously assign and propose necessary tasks in a scene without explicit human commands. The core innovation of this approach is the ability of TASMap to comprehend the context of objects within a scene and autonomously generate task proposals. This capability significantly advances autonomous robotic assistance, reducing the dependency on specific commands and enhancing interaction with environments. We present two key applications of TASMap: contextual task proposal and spatial task proposal. Our results, verified across 35 diverse and realistically disordered scenes, underscore the effectiveness of TASMap in both simulation and real-world environments.

### [High-Quality Unknown Object Instance Segmentation Via Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement]()

Accurate and efficient segmentation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is essential for robotic manipulation. Unknown Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), which aims to identify all objects in unknown categories and backgrounds, has become a key capability for various robotic tasks. However, existing methods struggle with over-segmentation and under-segmentation, leading to failures in manipulation tasks such as grasping. To address these challenges, we propose QuBER (Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement), a novel error-informed refinement approach for high-quality UOIS. QuBER first estimates quadruple boundary errors—true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels—at the instance boundaries of the initial segmentation. It then refines the segmentation using an error-guided fusion mechanism, effectively correcting both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that QuBER outperforms state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves various UOIS methods while maintaining a fast inference time of less than 0.1 seconds. Furthermore, we show that QuBER improves the success rate of grasping target objects in cluttered environments. Code and supplementary materials are available at https://sites.google.com/view/uois-quber.

### [Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Grounding with 3D Scene Graph]()

Locating objects described in natural language presents a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries.

### [A Light-Weight Framework for Open-Set Object Detection with Decoupled Feature Alignment in Joint Space]()

Open-set object detection (OSOD) is highly desirable for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet the requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden and complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a light-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and highly efficient solution for supporting real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems. Specifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a vision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) adaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a joint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of class-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the joint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving computational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector during the testing

### [LBSNet: Lightweight Joint Boundary Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Transparent and Reflective Objects]()

Accurate visual detection of transparent and reflective objects remains a challenging issue for mobile manipulators. For the most common depth cameras and LiDAR sensors, the distinctive optical attributes inherent in both transparent and reflective objects pose a significant challenge. To address this problem, this study proposes a lightweight joint boundary detection and semantic segmentation network named LBSNet. LBSNet aims to enhance the perception of transparent and reflective objects in complex and dynamic environments, using RGB images only. It leverages the synergy between boundary detection and semantic segmentation through feature fusion and a multitask learning mechanism. The encoder consists of two paths: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The gated channel adaptive (GCA) module enhances boundary features by learning channel parameters. The dynamic adaptive feature fusion (DAFF) module dynamically adjusts semantic and boundary information through cross-feature fusion. These methods effectively capture the distinctive characteristics of transparent and reflective objects, such as light refraction, boundary blurring and low contrast. Experimental results show that LBSNet achieves higher accuracy and faster processing speed on multiple public datasets compared with existing methods. Moreover, its lightweight design makes it suitable for resource-constrained mobile manipulators.

### [Sea-U-Whale: A Reconfigurable Marine Robot with Multi-Modal Motion]()

As marine exploration becomes increasingly important, marine robots have been extensively studied in recent years. Despite some well-designed robots have already achieved to various successful missions, most existing robots struggle to adapt to diverse demands or tasks due to their fixed structure and complexity of the marine environment. To address these challenges, we present a novel reconfigurable marine robot named Sea-U-Whale. This system can dynamically adjust its actuator configuration in the marine environment, providing superior environmental adaptability, maneuverability, and versatile mobility. Considering the demands of unmanned ocean exploration, an active reconfiguration mechanism and three distinct vehicle modes are designed for optimal actuation in various marine scenarios. The multi-modal mobility of our system and its robust performance have been validated through extensive field tests and water tank experiments, demonstrating its potential in handling a wide range of mission profiles.

### [MERLION: Marine ExploRation with Language guIded Online iNformative Visual Sampling and Enhancement]()

Autonomous and targeted underwater visual monitoring and exploration using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be a challenging task due to both online and offline constraints. The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired keyframes from the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV's visual experience. This challenge of targeted informative sampling is further aggravated in murky waters with poor visibility. In this paper, we present MERLION, a novel framework that provides semantically aligned and visually enhanced summaries for murky underwater marine environment monitoring and exploration. Specifically, our framework integrates (a) an image-text model for semantically aligning the visual samples to the user's needs, (b) an image enhancement model for murky water visual data and (c) an informative sampler for summarizing the monitoring experience. We validate our proposed MERLION framework on real-world data with user studies and present qualitative and quantitative results using our evaluation metric and show improved results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/MARVL-Lab/MERLION.git

### [PoLaRIS Dataset: A Maritime Object Detection and Tracking Dataset in Pohang Canal]()

Maritime environments often present hazardous situations due to factors such as moving ships or buoys, which become obstacles under the influence of waves. In such challenging conditions, the ability to detect and track potentially hazardous objects is critical for the safe navigation of marine robots, but datasets capturing these scenarios remain limited. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-modal dataset that includes image and point-wise annotations of maritime obstacles. Our dataset provides detailed ground truth for obstacle detection and tracking, including objects as small as 10×10 pixels, which are crucial for maritime safety. To validate the dataset’s effectiveness as a reliable benchmark, we conducted evaluations using various methodologies, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for object detection and tracking. These evaluations are expected to contribute to improving performance, particularly in the complex maritime environment. This represents the first demonstration of a dataset offering multi-modal annotations specifically tailored to maritime environments. Our dataset is available at https: //github.com/sparolab/PoLaRIS.

### [Confidence-Aware Object Capture for a Manipulator Subject to Floating-Base Disturbances]()

Capturing stationary aerial objects on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is challenging due to quasiperiodic and fast floating-base motions caused by wave-induced disturbances. It is hard to (1) maintain high motion prediction accuracy due to the stochastic nature of these disturbances and (2) perform object capture through real-time tracking due to the limited active torque. We introduce confidence analysis in predictive capture. To address the inaccuracy predictions, we calculate a real-time confidence tube to evaluate the prediction quality. To overcome tracking difficulties, we plan a trajectory to capture the object at a future moment while maximizing the confidence of the capture position on the predicted trajectory. All calculations are completed within 0.2 seconds to ensure a timely response. We validate our approach through experiments, where we simulate disturbances by executing real USV motions using a servo platform. The results demonstrate that our method achieves an 80% success rate.

Water caustics are commonly observed in seafloor imaging data from shallow-water areas. Traditional methods that remove caustic patterns from images often rely on 2D filtering or pre-training on an annotated dataset, hindering the performance when generalizing to real-world seafloor data with 3D structures. In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian Splatting (RecGS), which takes advantage of today’s photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to separate caustics from seafloor imagery. With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods, including joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches. The results show that our proposed RecGS paradigm can effectively separate the caustic from the seafloor, improving the visual appearance, and can be potentially applied on more problems with inconsistent illumination.

### [Learning to Fly in Seconds]()

Learning-based methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), hold great promise for streamlining deployment, enhancing performance, and achieving generalization in the control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles. Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU. The fast training times and deployment to a cheap, off-the-shelf quadrotor lower the barriers to entry and help democratize the research and development of these systems.

### [Multi-UAVs End-To-End Distributed Trajectory Generation Over Point Cloud Data]()

This paper introduces an end-to-end trajectory planning algorithm tailored for multi-UAV systems that gener- ates collision-free trajectories in environments populated with both static and dynamic obstacles, leveraging point cloud data. Our approach consists of a 2-branch neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimiza- tion, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physical actuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 − 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.

### [Lightweight yet High-Performance Defect Detector for UAV-Based Large-Scale Infrastructure Real-Time Inspection]()

Defect diagnosis in urban infrastructure is crucial for public safety. Traditional manual inspections face significant challenges in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and hardware-friendly large-scale infrastructure detector, CUPID, highly suitable for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the significant challenges in automatically detecting defects of varying intensity and size within complex infrastructure, along with the tendency of lightweight models to lose detail and fail to fully capture features during the defect extraction process, we propose the CUPID_Block, a multi-level information fusion block to construct the backbone, featuring the CUPID_Conv module equipped with our proposed CCA (CrissCross Attention). Furthermore, CUPID features an auxiliary training branch that assimilates lower feature maps, helping to recover details lost in deeper convolutional layers. To verify the effectiveness of CUPID and to address the lack of a suitable dataset in the community, we establish a multi-scenario infrastructure defect dataset, CUBIT2024, to conduct extensive experiments. Finally, to assess the efficiency and adaptability of CUPID in UAV for online infrastructure inspection, we design a compact autonomous drone, CU-Astro, where the proposed CUPID is deployed on the Jetson Orin NX computer onboard to evaluate the speed and power consumption of the inference.

### [ProxFly: Robust Control for Close Proximity Quadcopter Flight Via Residual Reinforcement Learning]()

This paper proposes the ProxFly, a residual deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller for close proximity quadcopter flight. Specifically, we design a residual module on top of a cascaded controller (denoted as basic controller) to generate high-level control commands, which compensate for external disturbances and thrust loss caused by downwash effects from other quadcopters. First, our method takes only the ego state and controllers' commands as inputs and does not rely on any communication between quadcopters, thereby reducing the bandwidth requirement. Through domain randomization, our method relaxes the requirement for accurate system identification and fine-tuned controller parameters, allowing it to adapt to changing system models. Meanwhile, our method not only reduces the proportion of unexplainable signals from the black box in control commands but also enables the RL training to skip the time-consuming exploration from scratch via guidance from the basic controller. We validate the effectiveness of the residual module in the simulation with different proximities. Moreover, we conduct the real close proximity flight test to compare ProxFly with the basic controller and an advanced model-based controller with complex aerodynamic compensation. Finally, we show that ProxFly can be used for challenging quadcopter mid-air docking, where two quadcopters fly in extreme proximity, and strong airflow significantly disrupts flight. However, our method can stabilize the quadcopter in this case and accomplish docking. The resources are available at https://github.com/ruiqizhang99/ProxFly.

### [TempFuser: Learning Agile, Tactical, and Acrobatic Flight Maneuvers Using a Long Short-Term Temporal Fusion Transformer]()

Dogfighting is a challenging scenario in aerial applications that requires a comprehensive understanding of both strategic maneuvers and the aerodynamics of agile aircraft. The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations. Demo videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/tempfuser.

### [Modular Reinforcement Learning for a Quadrotor UAV with Decoupled Yaw Control]()

This paper presents modular reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for the low-level control of a quadrotor, enabling direct control of yawing motion. While traditional monolithic RL approaches have demonstrated success in real-world autonomous flight, they often struggle to precisely control both the translational and yawing motions due to their distinct dynamic characteristics and strong coupling. Moreover, training a large-scale monolithic network typically demands a wealth of training data for broad generalization. To address these issues, we decompose the quadrotor dynamics into translational and yawing subsystems and assign dedicated modular RL agents for each. This design significantly improves performance, as each RL agent is trained for its specific purpose, and they are integrated in a synergistic way. It further enhances robustness, as potential failures within one module have minimal impact on the other, promoting fault tolerance. These improvements are illustrated by flight experiments achieved via zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. It is shown that the proposed modular policies substantially enhance training efficiency, tracking performance, and adaptability to real-world conditions.

### [HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model Reasoning]()

Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)—a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.

### [SPINE: Online Semantic Planning for Missions with Incomplete Natural Language Specifications in Unstructured Environments]()

As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots infer the relevant details. Because pre-built maps are difficult to obtain in many realistic settings, accomplishing such missions will require the robot to map and plan online. While many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified missions such as object search or exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning abilities over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. However, existing LLM-enabled planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks and semantics are provided by a pre-built map or a user. We address these limitations via SPINE, an online planner for missions with incomplete mission specifications provided in natural language. The planner uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission specification and then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. Tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new map observations. We evaluate SPINE in simulation and real-world settings with missions that require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000 square meters. Compared to baselines that use existing LLM-enabled planning approaches, our method is over twice as efficient in terms of time and distance, requires less user interactions, and does not require a full map. Additional resources are provided at https://zacravichandran.github.io/SPINE.

### [Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning for Robot Manipulation]()

Embodied reasoning systems integrate robotic hardware and cognitive processes to perform complex tasks, typically in response to a natural language query about a specific physical environment. This usually involves changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene (e.g., sort the objects from lightest to heaviest). In order to facilitate the development of such systems we introduce a new modular Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning (CLIER) approach that takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in 10 interactive benchmark scenarios. We extensively evaluate our reasoning approach in simulation and in real-world manipulation tasks with a success rate above 76% and 64%, respectively.

### [SayComply: Grounding Field Robotic Tasks in Operational Compliance through Retrieval-Based Language Models]()

This paper addresses the problem of task planning for robots that must comply with operational manuals in real-world settings. Task planning under these constraints is essential for enabling autonomous robot operation in domains that require adherence to domain-specific knowledge. Current methods for generating robot goals and plans rely on common sense knowledge encoded in large language models. However, these models lack grounding of robot plans to domain-specific knowledge and are not easily transferable between multiple sites or customers with different compliance needs. In this work, we present SayComply, which enables grounding robotic task planning with operational compliance using retrieval-based language models. We design a hierarchical database of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and procedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the limited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a tree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot tasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the domain knowledge in the database. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in real-world scenarios that require precise context retrieval across various types of context, outperforming the standard RAG method. Our approach bridges the gap in deploying robots that consistently adhere to operational protocols, offering a scalable and edge-deployable solution for ensuring compliance across varied and complex real-world environments.

### [LiP-LLM: Integrating Linear Programming and Dependency Graph with Large Language Models for Multi-Robot Task Planning]()

This study proposes LiP-LLM: integrating linear programming and dependency graph with large language models (LLMs) for multi-robot task planning. In order for multiple robots to perform tasks more efficiently, it is necessary to manage the precedence dependencies between tasks. Although multi-robot decentralized and centralized task planners using LLMs have been proposed, none of these studies focus on precedence dependencies from the perspective of task efficiency or leverage traditional optimization methods. It addresses key challenges in managing dependencies between skills and optimizing task allocation. LiP-LLM consists of three steps: skill list generation and dependency graph generation by LLMs, and task allocation using linear programming. The LLMs are utilized to generate a comprehensive list of skills and to construct a dependency graph that maps the relationships and sequential constraints among these skills. To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of skill execution, the skill list is generated by calculated likelihood, and linear programming is used to optimally allocate tasks to each robot. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing task planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in executing complex, multi-robot tasks. The results indicate the potential of combining LLMs with optimization techniques to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in executing coordinated tasks accurately and efficiently. In an environment with two robots, a maximum success rate difference of 0.82 is observed in the language instruction group with a change in the object name.

### [Transformer-Based Model Predictive Control: Trajectory Optimization Via Sequence Modeling]()

Model predictive control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling general-purpose robot autonomy in diverse real-world scenarios. However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.

### [A Method for Constructing Building Structure Grid Map Based on a Climbing Algorithm]()

Aerial-terrestrial amphibious robots excel in search and rescue tasks in unstructured terrains but face challenges in autonomous navigation indoors. Traditional full-mapping methods can degrade global path planning performance, especially when semi-static obstacles shift, leading to suboptimal paths. We propose a method for constructing building structure grid maps that are unaffected by semi-static obstacles. Our approach includes a building structure recognition algorithm based on an octree structure to differentiate between occupied and free grid cells. Experimental results demonstrate that coverage path planning on building structure grid maps produces superior global paths compared to traditional grid maps, offering a more streamlined and robust solution for autonomous navigation of aerial-terrestrial amphibious robots in indoor environments.

### [Efficient Scale-Uniform 3D Visual Coverage Algorithm for UAV Based on Elastic Photogrammetric Constraints]()

Unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with modern vision algorithms are crucial for missions such as reconstruction and target acquisition. However, when deployed in the field, undulating terrain can cause significant fluctuations in image scale and degrade the performance of vision algorithms. Instead of developing specialized image processing schemes with limited adaptability, this paper presents a novel 3D visual coverage algorithm that is compatible with existing generic vision algorithms and maintains a uniform image scale for ground targets. In detail, photogrammetric constraints are initially introduced to generate aerial waypoints, and then the negative effects of valley clustering are addressed. Elastic Photogrammetric Constraints (EPC) are further proposed to eliminate valley clustering effects induced by saddle terrain. The experimental results demonstrate that EPC reduces the traversal path length by up to 37.38% compared to the previous work, but with a minor trade-off in scale variations.

### [Target-Aware Viewpoint Generation for Active Robotic Exploration in Unknown Environments]()

When entering an unfamiliar environment, animals usually sweep off their surroundings to identify points of interest. In search and rescue robotics, autonomous exploration requires both coarse mapping of unknown areas and detailed target detection, which poses a significant challenge in balancing these tasks. To that end, we propose a target-aware robotic exploration framework that prioritizes both exploration efficiency and search completeness through three components: First, considering the computational limitations of robotic platforms, a lightweight 3D target detection method with post-fusion is introduced to detect target positions in real time. Secondly, we propose a target-aware viewpoint generation approach that integrates information gain and inspection gain to identify promising viewpoints for thorough target searches. Lastly, since a detailed examination of the environment demands numerous viewpoints, we propose a heuristic-based active exploration framework that employs a hierarchical structure to optimize exploration gain, traveling distance, and path smoothness to maximize the utility function of viewpoint sequences and ultimately find the optimal path. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate our framework significantly enhances target search capabilities, achieving a 13% average improvement in exploration efficiency over existing methods.

### [Online Multi-Robot Federated Learning for Distributed Coverage Control of Unknown Spatial Processes]()

Distributed multi-robot teams are increasingly used for optimal coverage of domains with unknown density distributions, often modeled with Gaussian Processes (GPs). However, current methods rely on data sharing, raising privacy concerns and computational issues. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) approach that enables collaborative training of GP models without sharing raw data. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we introduce a filtering strategy that selects relevant data samples, minimizing computational load. Realistic simulations emulating real scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving robust environmental estimates with minimal data sharing and reduced complexity.

### [Constrained Learning for Decentralized Multi-Objective Coverage Control]()

The multi-objective coverage control problem requires a robot swarm to collaboratively provide sensor coverage to multiple heterogeneous importance density fields (IDFs) simultaneously. We pose this as an optimization problem with constraints and study two different formulations: (1) Fair coverage, where we minimize the maximum coverage cost for any field, promoting equitable resource distribution among all fields; and (2) Constrained coverage, where each field must be covered below a certain cost threshold, ensuring that critical areas receive adequate coverage according to predefined importance levels. We study the decentralized setting where robots have limited communication and local sensing capabilities, making the system more realistic, scalable, and robust. Given the complexity, we propose a novel decentralized constrained learning approach that combines primal-dual optimization with a Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) neural network architecture. We show that the Lagrangian of the dual problem can be reformulated as a linear combination of the IDFs, enabling the LPAC policy to serve as a primal solver. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method (i) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized controllers by 30% on average in terms of coverage cost, (ii) transfers well to larger environments with more robots, and (iii) is scalable in the number of IDFs and robots in the swarm.

### [Di-NeRF: Distributed NeRF for Collaborative Learning with Relative Pose Refinement]()

Collaborative mapping of unknown environments can be done faster and more robustly than a single robot. However, a collaborative approach requires a distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with less accurate relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. See the website of the project for videos of the experiments and supplementary material https://sites.google.com/view/di-nerf/home.

### [A Hybrid Haptic Device for Virtual Car Door Interactions: Design and Implementation]()

As cars evolve from mere modes of transportation into living spaces, the importance of haptic interaction with vehicles is increasing. Here, we introduce a hybrid haptic device for the virtual prototyping of car doors, employing both the motor and brake. Physical prototyping, which is a conventional method for product designing, is often expensive and time-consuming. As a valuable alternative, virtual prototyping with a haptic device that delivers realistic haptic feedback can be utilized. However, replicating the substantial torque of a car door requires a high torque capacity motor, which can potentially pose safety risks to the user during haptic interaction. The proposed hybrid haptic device, combining a servo motor and a magnetic powder brake, effectively renders the dynamics of car doors. We experimentally measured the door's torque profile and confirmed significant friction from the door check mechanism and hinge. The torque profile was divided into active and passive torque, and each torque was distributed to the motor and brake, respectively. Finally, the proposed device and control method demonstrate the capability to accurately render the car door's kinesthetic haptic feedback, confirming its potential as an efficient tool for virtual prototyping in automotive design.

### [RAR-6: An Optimized Reconfigurable Asymmetric 6-DOF Haptic Robot for Gross and Fine Motor Tasks]()

Robot-assisted task-oriented training demonstrates immense potential in rehabilitation area. Parallel robots, with advantages such as low inertia and high stiffness, facilitate precise haptic feedback, yet their application in rehabilitation is limited by workspace constraints. To this end, we propose a design scheme for a haptic robot based on a reconfigurable asymmetric parallel mechanism. We first introduce a two-stage multi-objective optimization method to obtain the optimal parameter configurations. Then, to achieve precise assembling of the reconfigurable mechanism in each configuration, corresponding positioning mechanisms are designed. System performance tests validate the robot’s capabilities under different configurations: workspace meets design requirements, stiffness output reaches 30 N/mm, force output is 40 N, RMS of maximum back-driven force along x, y, and z axes is 7.5 N, and RMS of maximum back-driven torque around x and y axes is 567.4 N∙mm. Target tracking and virtual channel trajectory tracking experiments demonstrate the system’s haptic rendering ability for gross motor tasks (GMTs) and fine motor tasks (FMTs), respectively. The developed 6-DOF haptic robot holds promise for versatile task-oriented rehabilitation training.

### [Design, Implementation, and Validation of an Ungrounded Visuo-Tactile Haptic Interface for Robotic Teleoperation in High-Risk Steel Production]()

Haptic devices are widely used as control interfaces for robotic teleoperation, offering intuitive rendering of interactions between remote robot and environment. In particular, cutaneous feedback devices provide intrinsic stability and reduced form factor compared to kinesthetic feedback interfaces. However, the implementation of cutaneous feedback devices in industrial settings must be rigorously validated to prevent potential equipment accidents, which could lead to substantial economic losses due to unskilled robot manipulation. This paper presents a novel ungrounded haptic control interface (POstick-VF), designed specifically for high-risk steel production tasks. POstick-VF offers visuo-tactile feedback within an extensive workspace, enabling intuitive robot manipulation through its kinematic similarity with real tools ensuring safety. The performance of the developed POstick is rigorously validated and compared with conventional joystick controller through experiments conducted with an on-site hydraulic robot.

### [Enhanced Tiny Haptic Dial with T-Shaped Shaft Based on Magnetorheological Fluid]()

This paper introduces a tiny haptic dial utilizing magnetorheological fluid (MRF) to enhance its resistive torque feedback. Moreover, we design the T-shaped rotary shaft with bumps and embed it into the haptic dial to enhance its haptic performance (resistive torque). This structure enables two operation modes (shear and flow) of MRF that contribute to the actuation simultaneously in the proposed haptic dial. This structure allows the magnetic flux to flow towards the MRF, helping further maximize the resistive torque. We conduct a simulation to confirm that the magnetic flux generated from a solenoid forms a closed-loop magnetic path without magnetic saturation or leakage in the proposed haptic dial. The resistive torque of the proposed haptic dial varied from 8 N·mm to 47 N·mm as the input current changed from 0 to 300 mA, thus indicating that the proposed haptic dial can create a variety of haptic sensations in a tiny size (diameter: 20 mm; height:20 mm).

### [Path-Constrained Haptic Motion Guidance Via Adaptive Phase-Based Admittance Control]()

Robots have surpassed humans in terms of strength and precision, yet humans retain an unparalleled ability for decision-making in the face of unpredictable disturbances. This article aims to combine the strengths of both entities within a singular task: human motion guidance under strict geometric constraints, particularly adhering to predetermined paths. To tackle this challenge, a modular haptic guidance law is proposed that takes the human-applied wrench as an input. Using an auxiliary variable called phase, the generated desired motion is guaranteed to consistently adhere to the constraint path. It is demonstrated how the guidance policy can be generalized into physically interpretable terms, adjustable either prior to initiating the task or dynamically while the task is in progress. Additionally, an illustrative guidance adaptation policy is showcased that takes into account the human's manipulability. Leveraging passivity analysis, potential sources of instability are pinpointed, and subsequently, overall system stability is ensured by incorporating an augmented virtual energy tank. Lastly, a comprehensive set of experiments, including a 20-participant user study, explores various aspects of the approach in practice, encompassing both technical and usability consideration.

### [A Pneumatic-Actuated Feel-Through Wearable Haptic Display for Multi-Cue Delivery]()

Compared to the ”Seeing-through” paradigm for the concurrent display of both real and virtual images in vision-enabled Augmented Reality (AR), its haptic counterpart, i.e., the ”Feeling-through” via wearable tactile systems, which enables to experience simultaneously physical objects and haptically rendered virtual properties, is still largely unexplored. In a previous work, we introduced the Wearable-Fabric Yielding Display (W-FYD), which uses an elastic thin fabric as the interaction surface with the finger, allowing the delivery of softness-related cues both in active and passive exploration mode, together with sliding stimuli. The device was proven effective, but the current design faces form factor issues related to the dimensions and weight of the device, due to the actuation strategy of the lifting mechanism in the passive mode. To tackle this issue, we propose a miniaturized version of the system, named the W-FYD AIR, which allows reducing the overall dimensions of the device, from 100 × 60 × 36 mm to 78 × 45 × 37 mm, and its weight, from 100 g to 54 g, by exploiting pneumatically-actuated chambers for the lifting mechanism. Through careful sizing of each component and a process of characterization and identification, we demonstrated that the new system attained the same characteristics and functionality as the original one.

### [How Generalizable Is My Behavior Cloning Policy? a Statistical Approach to Trustworthy Performance Evaluation]()

With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source.

### [Fine-Grained Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Fined-Grained Prompts: Task, Dataset and Benchmark]()

Open-vocabulary detectors are proposed to locate and recognize objects in novel classes. However, variations in vision-aware language vocabulary data used for open-vocabulary learning can lead to unfair and unreliable evaluations. Recent evaluation methods have attempted to address this issue by incorporating object properties or adding locations and characteristics to the captions. Nevertheless, since these properties and locations depend on the specific details of the images instead of classes, detectors can not make accurate predictions without precise descriptions provided through human annotation. This paper introduces3F-OVD, a novel task that extends supervised fine-grained object detection to the open-vocabulary setting. Our task is intuitive and challenging, requiring a deep understanding offine-grained captionsand careful attention tofine-grained detailsin images in order to accurately detectfine-grained objects. Additionally, due to the scarcity of qualified fine-grained object detection datasets, we have created a new dataset,NEU-171K, tailored for both supervised and open-vocabulary settings. We benchmark state-of-the-art object detectors on our dataset for both settings. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing technique. Our data, annotations, and codes are available athttps://github.com/tengerye/3FOVD.

### [GPU-Accelerated Subsystem-Based ADMM for Large-Scale Interactive Simulation]()

In this paper, we implement the GPU-accelerated subsystem-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SubADMM) for interactive simulation. The challenging objective for interactive simulations is to deliver realistic results under tight performance, even for large-scale scenarios. We aim to achieve this by exploiting the parallelizable nature of SubADMM to the fullest extent. We introduce a new subsystem division strategy to make SubADMM `GPU friendly' along with custom kernel designs and optimization regarding efficient memory access patterns. We successfully implement the GPU-accelerated SubADMM and show the accuracy and speed of the framework for large-scale scenarios, highlighted with an interactive `Hand demo' scenario. We also show improved robustness and accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art interactive simulators with several challenging scenarios that introduce large-scale ill-conditioned dynamics problems.

### [Local Policies Enable Zero-Shot Long-Horizon Manipulation]()

Sim2real for robotic manipulation is difficult due to the challenges of simulating complex contacts and generating realistic task distributions. To tackle the latter problem, we introduce ManipGen, which leverages a new class of policies for sim2real transfer: local policies. Locality enables a variety of appealing properties including invariances to absolute robot and object pose, skill ordering, and global scene configuration. We combine these policies with foundation models for vision, language and motion planning and demonstrate SOTA zero-shot performance of our method to Robosuite benchmark tasks in simulation (97%). We transfer our local policies from simulation to reality and observe they can solve unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks with up to 8 stages with significant pose, object and scene configuration variation. ManipGen outperforms SOTA approaches such as SayCan, OpenVLA and LLMTrajGen across 50 real-world manipulation tasks by 36%, 76% and 62% respectively. All code, models and datasets will be released.

### [DART: Dexterous Augmented Reality Teleoperation Platform for Large-Scale Robot Data Collection in Simulation]()

The scarcity of diverse and high-quality data impedes the quest to build a generalist robotic system. Current robotics data collection efforts face many challenges: the need for physical robotic hardware, setting up the environment, frequent resets, and the fatigue for data collectors operating real robots. We introduce DART, a teleoperation platform designed for crowdsourcing that reimagines robotic data collection by leveraging cloud-based simulation and augmented reality (AR) to address many limitations of prior data collection efforts. User studies show that DART enables higher data collection throughput and lower physical fatigue than real-world teleoperation. We also demonstrate that policies trained using DART-collected datasets successfully transfer to reality and are robust to unseen visual disturbances. All data collected through DART is automatically stored in a cloud-hosted database, DexHub, paving the path for an ever-growing data hub for robot learning.

### [TransFusion: A Practical and Effective Transformer-Based Diffusion Model for 3D Human Motion Prediction]()

Predicting human motion plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and effective human-robot close collaboration in intelligent remanufacturing systems of the future. Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse predictions based on observations. The former group fails to address the uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth orbecome unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more practical and effective model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our human motion prediction model.

### [DE-TGN: Uncertainty-Aware Human Motion Forecasting Using Deep Ensembles]()

Ensuring the safety of human workers in a collaborative environment with robots is of utmost importance. Although accurate pose prediction models can help prevent collisions between human workers and robots, they are still susceptible to critical errors. In this study, we propose a novel approach called deep ensembles of temporal graph neural networks (DE-TGN) that not only accurately forecast human motion but also provide a measure of prediction uncertainty. By leveraging deep ensembles and employing stochastic Monte-Carlo dropout sampling, we construct a volumetric field representing a range of potential future human poses based on covariance ellipsoids. To validate our framework, we conducted experiments using three motion capture datasets including Human3.6M, and two human-robot interaction scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art prediction error. Moreover, we discovered that deep ensembles not only enable us to quantify uncertainty but also improve the accuracy of our predictions.

### [A Large-Scale Dataset for Humanoid Robotics Enabling a Novel Data-Driven Fall Prediction]()

In this paper, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising 37.9 hours of sensor data collected from humanoid robots, including 18.3 hours of walking and 2,519 recorded falls. This extensive dataset is a valuable resource for various robotics and machine learning applications. Leveraging this data, we propose RePro-TCN, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) enhanced with two novel extensions: Relaxed Loss Formulation and Progressive Forecasting. Predicting falls is a critical capability in humanoid robotics for implementing countermeasures such as lunging or stopping the walk. Thanks to the new dataset, we train RePro-TCN and demonstrate its superiority over previous approaches under real-world conditions that were previously unattainable.

### [Social-MAE: Social Masked Autoencoder for Multi-Person Motion Representation Learning]()

For seamless robot navigation, it’s vital to thoroughly understand multi-person scenes, which requires moving beyond simple tasks such as detection and tracking. Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial. Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data. The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable representations of motion in human crowded scenes. Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints’ trajectory. After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks. Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding. These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose.

### [Depth-Temporal Attention with Dual Modality Data for Walking Intention Prediction in Close-Proximity Front-Following]()

The role of robot following is crucial for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional methods often rely on maintaining a significant distance between the robot and the human, which limits interaction and responsiveness. In contrast, close-proximity front-following facilitates immediate engagement, enhancing user experience and improving human-robot interaction. Nonetheless, it presents challenges in accurately interpreting human walking intentions due to a restricted observational field. In our paper, we introduce an innovative Depth-Temporal Attention Network that takes lower-limb depth images and robot motor signals as input, to accurately predict human walking intentions. This network leverages a depth attention module to capture essential spatial features and integrates a temporal attention mechanism to analyze movement dynamics. To enhance generalization, we use a domain adversarial module that focuses on shared features across diverse walking data, ensuring consistent performance across users. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive average intention prediction accuracy of 91.09%, significantly surpassing baseline models by 12.59% to 23.66%. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that the depth-attention module substantially improves the model's understanding of depth features, resulting in an 11.44% increase in accuracy. With this high prediction accuracy, smooth front-following is achieved at close-proximity.

### [UPTor: Unified 3D Human Pose Dynamics and Trajectory Prediction for Human-Robot Interaction]()

We introduce a unified approach to forecast the dynamics of human keypoints along with the motion trajectory based on a short sequence of input poses. While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset "DARKO" with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets. Result animations, our dataset, and code will be available at https://nisarganc.github.io/UPTor-page/

### [Category-Level Neural Field for Reconstruction of Partially Observed Objects in Indoor Environment]()

Neural implicit representation has attracting at- tention in 3D reconstruction through various success cases. For further applications such as scene understanding or editing, sev- eral works have shown progress towards object-compositional reconstruction. Despite their superior performance in observed regions, their performance is still limited in reconstructing ob- jects that are partially observed. To better treat this problem, we introduce a category-level neural fields which learns meaningful common 3D information among objects belonging to the same category present in the scene. Our key idea is to subcategorize objects based on their observed shape for better training of category-level model. Then we take advantage of the neural field to conduct the challenging task of registering partially observed objects by selecting and aligning against representa- tive objects selected by ray-based uncertainty. Experiments on both simulation and real-world dataset demonstrate that our method improve reconstruction of unobserved part for several categories.

### [PlanarNeRF: Online Learning of Planar Primitives with Neural Radiance Fields]()

Identifying spatially complete planar primitives from visual data is a crucial task in computer vision. Prior methods are largely restricted to either 2D segment recovery or simplifying 3D structures, even with extensive plane annotations. We present PlanarNeRF, a novel framework capable of detecting dense 3D planes through online learning. Drawing upon the neural field representation, PlanarNeRF brings three major contributions. First, it enhances 3D plane detection with concurrent appearance and geometry knowledge. Second, a lightweight plane fitting module is used to estimate plane parameters. Third, a novel global memory bank structure with an update mechanism is introduced, ensuring consistent cross-frame correspondence. The flexible architecture of PlanarNeRF allows it to function in both 2D-supervised and self-supervised solutions, in each of which it can effectively learn from sparse training signals, significantly improving training efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanarNeRF in various real-world scenarios and remarkable improvement in 3D plane detection over existing works.

### [FreeDriveRF: Monocular RGB Dynamic NeRF without Poses for Autonomous Driving Via Point-Level Dynamic-Static Decoupling]()

Dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving enables vehicles to perceive and interpret complex scene changes more precisely. Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently shown promising capability in scene modeling. However, many existing methods rely heavily on accurate poses inputs and multi-sensor data, leading to increased system complexity. To address this, we propose FreeDriveRF, which reconstructs dynamic driving scenes using only sequential RGB images without requiring poses inputs. We innovatively decouple dynamic and static parts at the early sampling level, avoiding image blurring and artifacts. To overcome the challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss, utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process. Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dynamic scene modeling for autonomous driving.

### [LLGS: Unsupervised Gaussian Splatting for Image Enhancement and Reconstruction in Pure Dark Environment]()

3D Gaussian Splatting has shown remarkable capabilities in novel view rendering tasks and exhibits significant potential for multi-view optimization. However, the original 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks color representation for inputs in lowlight environments. Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multiview stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zeroknowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-theart methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

### [Hash-GS: Anchor-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting with Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding for Efficient Scene Reconstruction]()

Realistic 3D object and scene reconstruction is pivotal in advancing fields such as world model simulation and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we introduce Hash-GS, a storage-efficient method for large-scale scene reconstruction using anchor-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The vanilla 3DGS struggles with high memory demands due to the large number of primitives, especially in complex or extensive scenes. Hash-GS addresses these challenges with a compact representation by leveraging high-dimensional features to parameterize primitive properties, stored in compact hash tables, which reduces memory usage while preserving rendering quality. It also incorporates adaptive anchor management to efficiently control the number of anchors and neural Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce an analytic 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and support Level-of-Detail for optimized rendering across varying intrinsic parameters. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Hash-GS improves storage efficiency while maintaining competitive rendering performance, especially in large-scale scenes.

### [Elite-EvGS: Learning Event-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting by Distilling Event-To-Video Priors]()

Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that output asynchronous and sparse event streams, instead of fixed frames. Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named textbf{Elite-EvGS}. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel textit{warm-up initialization strategy} that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a textit{progressive event supervision strategy} that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes. For demo and more results, please check our project page: https://vlislab22.github.io/elite-evgs/

### [Hysteresis Compensation of Flexible Continuum Manipulator Using RGBD Sensing and Temporal Convolutional Network]()

Flexible continuum manipulators are valued for minimally invasive surgery, offering access to confined spaces through nonlinear paths. However, cable-driven manipulators face control difficulties due to hysteresis from cabling effects such as friction, elongation, and coupling. These effects are difficult to model due to nonlinearity and the difficulties become even more evident when dealing with long and coupled, multi-segmented manipulator. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture these nonlinear and previous states-dependent characteristics of cable actuation. We collect physical joint configurations according to command joint configurations using RGBD sensing and 7 fiducial markers to model the hysteresis of the proposed manipulator. Result on a study comparing the estimation performance of four DNN models show that the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) demonstrates the highest predictive capability. Leveraging trained TCNs, we build a control algorithm to compensate for hysteresis. Tracking tests in task space using unseen trajectories show that the proposed control algorithm reduces the average position and orientation error by 61.39% (from 13.7mm to 5.29 mm) and 64.04% (from 31.17° to 11.21°), respectively. This result implies that the proposed calibrated controller effectively reaches the desired configurations by estimating the hysteresis of the manipulator. Applying this method in real surgical scenarios has the potential to enhance control precision and improve surgical performance.

### [Command Filtered Cartesian Impedance Control for Tendon Driven Continuum Manipulators with Actuator Fault Compensation]()

Continuum robots are well-suited for constrained environments due to their superior flexibility and structural compliance. However, relying solely on passive compliance may lead to damage to both the robot and the surrounding environment. This work proposes a finite-time Cartesian impedance control scheme for tendon-driven continuum manipulators (TDCMs), where a second-order low-pass filter is used to adjust the reference trajectory according to the external robot tip force. The controller is designed using the command filtered backstepping method, and the finite-time stability is established by the designed Lyapunov function. In TDCM systems, the tendons operate antagonistically, and actuators often fail to quickly reach the desired tendon tension, leading to partial failures. To address this, we propose an actuator fault compensation algorithm to enhance system performance and reliability. We conducted trajectory tracking experiments on a multi-segment TDCM prototype, the results demonstrate that the designed Cartesian impedance controller achieves effective compliance control effect and high position control accuracy.

### [A Synergistic Framework for Learning Shape Estimation and Shape-Aware Whole-Body Control Policy for Continuum Robots]()

In this paper, we present a novel synergistic framework for learning shape estimation and a shape-aware whole-body control policy for continuum robots. Our approach leverages the interaction between two Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs) - the Shape-NODE and Control-NODE - to achieve continuous shape estimation and shape-aware control. The Shape-NODE integrates prior knowledge from Cosserat rod theory, allowing it to adapt and account for model mismatches, while the Control-NODE uses this shape information to optimize a whole-body control policy, trained in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. This unified framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the framework’s robust performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end, Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### [On the Benefits of Hysteresis in Tendon Driven Continuum Robots]()

Hysteresis in the tendons driving continuum robots is frequently regarded as a nuisance and a problem that is best avoided. Some prior work seeks to ameliorate the effects of hysteresis through the selection of materials. Others propose models of hysteresis to compensate for their effects. In this work, we present an empirically validated model of hysteresis in tendon-driven continuum robots. We demonstrate that hysteresis contributes to the stability of these robots by mitigating undesirable tensions in robot's backbone. As a result, a model-based approach to hysteresis can be used not just for compensation of a nuisance, but to enhance the utility of continuum robots in safety critical applications such as medical robots.

### [Automating Tension Calibration for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots: A Low-Cost Approach towards Consistent Teleoperation]()

We present a low-cost method to automate tension calibration for tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs), particularly those lacking tension sensing. Our method utilizes Hall effect sensors to localize the robot’s tip with respect to the one-dimensional trajectory it follows under individual tendon actuation. We propose two workflows for robots with and without a static model, making the method generalizable to other tendon-driven soft robots. We demonstrate our method’s ability to repeatably tension the tendons through associated tendon displacements. The calibration approach’s measured repeatability (±0.03 mm) is also benchmarked against manual calibration on a TDCR prototype, and its accuracy in achieving target tensions is assessed ((0.06±0.20) N). We further investigate how tension calibration impacts open-loop tracking accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of our method to enhance motion consistency in open-loop control and teleoperation.

### [A Neural Network-Based Framework for Fast and Smooth Posture Reconstruction of a Soft Continuum Arm]()

A neural network-based framework is developed and experimentally demonstrated for the problem of estimating the shape of a soft continuum arm (SCA) from noisy measurements of the pose at a finite number of locations along the length of the arm. The neural network takes as input these measurements and produces as output a finite-dimensional approximation of the strain, which is further used to reconstruct the infinite-dimensional smooth posture. This problem is important for various soft robotic applications. It is challenging due to the flexible aspects that lead to the infinite-dimensional reconstruction problem for the continuous posture and strains. Because of this, past solutions to this problem are computationally intensive. The proposed fast smooth reconstruction method is shown to be five orders of magnitude faster while having comparable accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two testbeds: a simulated octopus muscular arm and a physical BR2 pneumatic soft manipulator.

### [GraspSAM: When Segment Anything Model Meets Grasp Detection]()

Grasp detection requires flexibility to handle objects of various shapes without relying on prior object knowledge, while also offering intuitive, user-guided control. In this paper, we introduce GraspSAM, an innovative extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) designed for prompt-driven and category-agnostic grasp detection. Unlike previous methods, which are often limited by small-scale training data, GraspSAM leverages SAM’s large-scale training and prompt-based segmentation capabilities to efficiently support both target-object and category-agnostic grasping. By utilizing adapters, learnable token embeddings, and a lightweight modified decoder, GraspSAM requires minimal fine-tuning to integrate object segmentation and grasp prediction into a unified framework. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including Jacquard, Grasp-Anything, and Grasp-Anything++. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraspSAM’s flexibility in handling different types of prompts (such as points, boxes, and language), highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in real-world robotic applications. Robot demonstrations, additional results, and code can be found at https://gistailab.github.io/GraspSAM/.

### [Dexterous Ungrasping Manipulation in Three Dimensions]()

This study focuses on the robotic capability of ungrasping, or releasing, an object in a grasp from the gripper to the robot’s environment. The presented technique enables the delicate release of a grasped object using non-static contacts, allowing for rolling and/or sliding. This dexterous manipulation capability is particularly relevant when ungrasping thin or slender objects, as will be demonstrated with real examples. We initially discuss the establishment of three-dimensional stability during ungrasping manipulation, ensuring robustness. Subsequently, we present a planning and control solution for three-dimensional ungrasping, building upon our previous planar version. A series of experiments across various test scenarios, ranging from precision placement to puzzle tiling, showcase the viability and effectiveness of our approach.

### [RTAGrasp: Learning Task-Oriented Grasping from Human Videos Via Retrieval, Transfer, and Alignment]()

Task-oriented grasping (TOG) is crucial for robots to accomplish manipulation tasks, requiring the determination of TOG positions and directions. Existing methods either rely on costly manual TOG annotations or only extract coarse grasping positions or regions from human demonstrations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce RTAGrasp, a Retrieval, Transfer, and Alignment framework inspired by human grasping strategies. Specifically, our approach first effortlessly constructs a robot memory from human grasping demonstration videos, extracting both TOG position and direction constraints. Then, given a task instruction and a visual observation of the target object, RTAGrasp retrieves the most similar human grasping experience from its memory and leverages semantic matching capabilities of vision foundation models to transfer the TOG constraints to the target object in a training-free manner. Finally, RTAGrasp aligns the transferred TOG constraints with the robot's action for execution. Evaluations on the public TOG benchmark, TaskGrasp dataset, show the competitive performance of RTAGrasp on both seen and unseen object categories compared to existing baseline methods. Real-world experiments further validate its effectiveness on a robotic arm. Our code, appendix, and video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/rtagrasp/home.

### [You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-Stage, Real-Time Category-Level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping]()

This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [Point Cloud Decomposition for Task-Oriented Grasping]()

Accurate localization of graspable regions within a single object point cloud is critical to enable task-based robot grasps. State-of-the-art task-based robot grasp synthesis methods fits over-approximated 3D bounding boxes that fails to isolate graspable regions even if they exist. While deep learning or geometrical shape decomposition methods can offer improved approximations, they lack guarantees for the graspability of segmented regions, require prior knowledge of the object, and/or demand large annotated datasets for fine-tuning. In this paper, we overcome these limitations to introduce ITSI. ITSI is a complete, task-oriented grasp synthesis approach that functions independently of object-specific knowledge. ITSI (Iterative Slicing) effectively segments multiple graspable regions that conform to the constraints of robot grippers thereby enabling compatibility with any object a robot seeks to grasp and any robot gripper size. Our extensive real-world and simulation experiments on diverse object datasets demonstrates how ITSI dramatically increases the number of discoverable robot grasps by up to 44% when compared to the state-of-the-art. We also expand ITSI's capabilities beyond task-based robot grasp synthesis to highlight its performance in human affordance segmentation outperforming fully supervised deep learning methods by 1%.

### [Adaptive Grasping of Moving Objects in Dense Clutter Via Global-To-Local Detection and Static-To-Dynamic Planning]()

Robotic grasping is facing a variety of real-world uncertainties caused by non-static object states, unknown object properties, and cluttered object arrangements. The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform stably across varying conditions. In this study, we extend the idea of using similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered where multiple uncertainties coexist with a single in-hand camera. We achieve this difficult task by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic states. We propose several methods and algorithms to optimize planning efficiency and accuracy. Our system is adaptive to different object types, arrangements and movement speeds without additional training, as proved by our real-world experiments.

### [UASTHN: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Homography Estimation for UAV Satellite-Thermal Geo-Localization]()

Geo-localization is an essential component of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation systems to ensure precise absolute self-localization in outdoor environments. To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents UASTHN, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty. Our research provides profound insights into the broader intersection of localization and uncertainty estimation. The code and models are publicly available.

### [Enhancing Feature Tracking Reliability for Visual Navigation Using Real-Time Safety Filter]()

Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.

### [SuperLoc: The Key to Robust LiDAR-Inertial Localization Lies in Predicting Alignment Risks]()

Map-based LiDAR localization, while widely used in autonomous systems, faces significant challenges in degraded environments due to the lack of distinct geometric features. This paper introduces SuperLoc, a robust LiDAR localization package that addresses key limitations in existing methods. SuperLoc features a novel predictive alignment risk assessment technique, enabling early detection and mitigation of potential failures before optimization. This approach significantly improves performance in challenging scenarios such as corridors, tunnels, and caves. Unlike existing degeneracy mitigation algorithms that rely on post-optimization analysis and heuristic thresholds, SuperLoc evaluates the localizability of raw sensor measurements. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various degraded environments. Our approach achieves a 49.7% increase in accuracy and exhibits the highest robustness. To facilitate further research, we release our implementation along with datasets from eight challenging scenarios.

### [Active Illumination for Visual Ego-Motion Estimation in the Dark]()

Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) systems often struggle in low-light and dark environments due to the lack of robust visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.

### [Intensity Triangle Descriptor Constructed from High-Resolution Spinning LiDAR Intensity Image for Loop Closure Detection]()

LiDAR-based loop closure detection is a crucial part of realizing robust SLAM algorithms for intelligent vehicles with LiDAR sensors. Existing methods often reduce the keypoint dimension to encode the global descriptor, which sacrifices the freedom of loop detection and correction. Based on the 6-DOF rigid transformation property of spatial triangles, we propose an algorithm for extracting and describing 3D keypoints from high-resolution spinning LiDAR intensity images to encode triangle descriptors, termed intensity triangle descriptor (ITD). In comparison to the direct extraction of keypoints from the point cloud, the use of image-derived feature points provides additional photometric texture information and better handles uneven spatial density of the point cloud, which is advantageous in unstructured and geometrically degraded scenes. To enhance the stability of keypoints, the spatial positions of multi-frame image feature points are registered to a keyframe by an odometer for voxel downsampling and non-maximum suppression, with the objective of reducing unstable feature points. For high discrimination, the neighbor image patches of each vertex (keypoint) are aggregated to estimate a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the keypoint signature. An efficient two-stage loop closure detection method is then proposed for ITD, consisting of candidate retrieval based on triangle side lengths and vertex GMMs, followed by geometric verification of matched descriptor pairs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the STheReO, FusionPortable, and our self-collected datasets.

### [IBTC: An Image-Assisting Binary and Triangle Combined Descriptor for Place Recognition by Fusing LiDAR and Camera Measurements]()

In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal descriptor, the image-assisting binary, and triangle combined (iBTC) descriptor, which fuses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and camera measurements for 3D place recognition. The inherent invariance of a triangle to rigid transformations inspires us to design triangle-based descriptors. We first extract distinct 3D key points from both LiDAR and camera measurements and organize them into triplets to form triangles. By utilizing the lengths of the sides of these triangles, we can create triangle descriptors, enabling the rapid retrieval of similar triangles from a database. By encoding the geometric and visual details at the triangle vertices into binary descriptors, we augment the triangle descriptors with richer local information. This enrichment process empowers our descriptors to reject mismatched triangle pairs. Consequently, the remaining matched triangle pairs yield accurate loop closure place indices and relative poses. In our experiments, we conduct a thorough comparison of our proposed method with several SOTA methods across public and self-collected datasets. The results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance in place recognition and overcomes the limitations associated with unimodal methods like BTC, RING++, ORB-DBoW2, and NetVLAD. Additionally, we performed a time cost benchmark experiment and the result indicates that our method’s time consumption is reasonable, compared with baseline methods. A demonstration video is available on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1Q0eR2fWk.

### [Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence]()

We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE.

### [Safe and Efficient Path Planning under Uncertainty Via Deep Collision Probability Fields]()

Estimating collision probabilities between robots and environmental obstacles or other moving agents is crucial to ensure safety during path planning. This is an important building block of modern planning algorithms in many application scenarios such as autonomous driving, where noisy sensors perceive obstacles. While many approaches exist, they either provide too conservative estimates of the collision probabilities or are computationally intensive due to their sampling-based nature. To deal with these issues, we introduce Deep Collision Probability Fields, a neural-based approach for computing collision probabilities of arbitrary objects with arbitrary unimodal uncertainty distributions. Our approach relegates the computationally intensive estimation of collision probabilities via sampling at the training step, allowing forfast neural network inference of the constraints during planning. In extensive experiments, we show that Deep Collision Probability Fields can produce reasonably accurate collision probabilities (up to 10^{-3}) for planning and that our approach can be easily plugged into standard path planning approaches to plan safe paths on 2-D maps containing uncertain static and dynamic obstacles.

### [Safe POMDP Online Planning among Dynamic Agents Via Adaptive Conformal Prediction]()

Online planning for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provides efficient techniques for robot decision-making under uncertainty. However, existing methods fall short of preventing safety violations in dynamic environments. This work presents a novel safe POMDP online planning approach that maximizes expected returns while providing probabilistic safety guarantees amidst environments populated by multiple dynamic agents. Our approach utilizes data-driven trajectory prediction models of dynamic agents and applies Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) to quantify the uncertainties in these predictions. Leveraging the obtained ACP-based trajectory predictions, our approach constructs safety shields on-the-fly to prevent unsafe actions within POMDP online planning. Through experimental evaluation in various dynamic environments using real-world pedestrian trajectory data, the proposed approach has been shown to effectively maintain probabilistic safety guarantees while accommodating up to hundreds of dynamic agents.

### [Rao-Blackwellized POMDP Planning]()

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a structured framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but their application requires efficient belief updates. Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filters (SIRPF), also known as Bootstrap Particle Filters, are commonly used as belief updaters in large approximate POMDP solvers, but they face challenges such as particle deprivation and high computational costs as the system's state dimension grows. To address these issues, this study introduces Rao-Blackwellized POMDP (RB-POMDP) approximate solvers and outlines generic methods to apply Rao-Blackwellization in both belief updates and online planning. We compare the performance of SIRPF and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) in a simulated localization problem where an agent navigates toward a target in a GPS-denied environment using POMCPOW and RB-POMCPOW planners. Our results not only confirm that RBPFs maintain efficient belief approximations over time with fewer particles, but, more surprisingly, RBPFs combined with quadrature-based integration improves planning quality significantly compared to SIRPF-based planning under the same computational limits.

### [Nearest-Neighbourless Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning with Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*)]()

Improving the performance of motion planning algorithms for high-degree-of-freedom robots usually requires reducing the cost or frequency of computationally expensive operations. Traditionally, and especially for asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planners, the most expensive operations are local motion validation and querying the nearest neighbours of a configuration. Recent advances have significantly reduced the cost of motion validation by using single instruction/multiple data (SIMD) parallelism to improve solution times for satisficing motion planning problems. These advances have not yet been applied to asymptotically optimal motion planning. This paper presents Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*), the first fully connected, informed, anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) algorithm. FCIT* exploits the radically reduced cost of edge evaluation via SIMD parallelism to build and search fully connected graphs. This removes the need for nearest-neighbours structures, which are a dominant cost for many sampling-based motion planners, and allows it to find initial solutions faster than state-of-the-art ASAO (VAMP, OMPL) and satisficing (OMPL) algorithms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset while converging towards optimal plans in an anytime manner.

### [Efficient Path Planning in Complex Environments with Trust Region Continuous Belief Tree Search]()

Real-world applications of path planning must contend with complicated constraint and objective functions imposed by the surrounding operational and regulatory environment. Traditional methods such as PRM* and RRT* have asymptotic guarantees, but often struggle in practice with complex black-box objective/constraint functions, especially in compute-limited situations. Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS) addresses these limitations by maintaining local estimates of the objective function in order to sample new nodes from continuous space, often giving high-quality solutions more quickly. However, CBTS requires careful tuning of a control duration parameter, which introduces a tradeoff between compute time and path cost/feasibility. In environments with complex costs and constraints, there may be no single control duration that gives good paths in short compute time. This paper proposes Trust Region CBTS (TR-CBTS), an extension of CBTS with an adaptive control duration parameter inspired by trust region methods. TR-CBTS adjusts control duration based on information from recently sampled candidate nodes, allowing longer control duration where possible to speed up compute time, and shortening control duration when precise navigation in environments with complex, unknown constraint and objective functions. We show TR-CBTS outperforms existing comparable planners for a realistic robotic path planning application in autonomous ship routing.

### [PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-Based Multiagent Trajectory Planner]()

In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5614 times faster than optimization-based approaches.

### [HGS-Planner: Hierarchical Planning Framework for Active Scene Reconstruction Using 3D Gaussian Splatting]()

In complex missions such as search and rescue, robots must make intelligent decisions in unknown environments, relying on their ability to perceive and understand their surroundings. High-quality and real-time reconstruction enhances situational awareness and is crucial for intelligent robotics. Traditional methods often struggle with poor scene representation or are too slow for real-time use. Inspired by the efficacy of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose a hierarchical planning framework for fast and high-fidelity active reconstruction. Our method evaluates completion and quality gain to adaptively guide reconstruction, integrating global and local planning for efficiency. Experiments in simulated and real-world environments show our approach outperforms existing real-time methods.

### [An Active Perception Game for Robust Information Gathering]()

Active perception approaches select future viewpoints by using some estimate of the information gain. An inaccurate estimate can be detrimental in critical situations, e.g., locating a person in distress. However the true information gained can only be calculated post hoc, i.e., after the observation is realized. We present an approach to estimate the discrepancy between the estimated information gain (which is the expectation over putative future observations while neglecting correlations among them) and the true information gain. The key idea is to analyze the mathematical relationship between active perception and the estimation error of the information gain in a game-theoretic setting. Using this, we develop an online estimation approach that achieves sub-linear regret (in the number of time-steps) for the estimation of the true information gain and reduces the sub-optimality of active perception systems. We demonstrate our approach for active perception using a comprehensive set of experiments on: (a) different types of environments, including a quadrotor in a photorealistic simulation, real-world robotic data, and real-world experiments with ground robots exploring indoor and outdoor scenes; (b) different types of robotic perception data; and (c) different map representations. On average, our approach reduces information gain estimation errors by 42%, increases the information gain by 7%, PSNR by 5%, and semantic accuracy (measured as the number of objects that are localized correctly) by 6%. In real-world experiments with a Jackal ground robot, our approach demonstrated complex trajectories to explore occluded regions.

### [Take Your Best Shot: Sampling-Based Planning for Autonomous Photography]()

Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) equipped with high-quality cameras are revolutionizing the field of autonomous photography by delivering efficient and cost-effective methods for capturing dynamic visual content. As AMRs are deployed in increasingly diverse environments, the challenge of consistently producing high-quality photographic content remains. Traditional approaches often involve AMRs following a predetermined path while capturing data-intensive imagery, which can be suboptimal, especially in environments with limited connectivity or physical obstructions. These drawbacks necessitate intelligent decision-making to pinpoint optimal vantage points for image capture. Inspired by Next Best View studies, we propose a novel autonomous photography framework that enhances image quality and minimizes the number of photos needed. This framework incorporates a proposed evaluation metric that leverages ray-tracing and Gaussian process interpolation, enabling the assessment of potential visual information from the target in partially known environments. A derivative-free optimization (DFO) method is then proposed to sample candidate views and identify the optimal viewpoint. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by comparing it with existing methods and further validated through simulations and experiments with various vehicles.

This article presents an appendix to the original NeBula autonomy solution developed by the Team Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots (CoSTAR), participating in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, this article presents extensions to NeBula’s hardware, software, and algorithmic components that focus on increasing the range and scale of the exploration environment. From the algorithmic perspective, we discuss the following extensions to the original NeBula framework: 1) large-scale geometric and semantic environment mapping; 2) an adaptive positioning system; 3) probabilistic traversability analysis and local planning; 4) large-scale partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)-based global motion planning and exploration behavior; 5) large-scale networking and decentralized reasoning; 6) communication-aware mission planning; and 7) multimodal ground–aerial exploration solutions. We demonstrate the application and deployment of the presented systems and solutions in various large-scale underground environments, including limestone mine exploration scenarios as well as deployment in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.

### [InstanceVO: Self-Supervised Semantic Visual Odometry by Using Metric Learning to Incorporate Geometrical Priors in Instance Objects]()

Visual odometry is one of the key technologies for unmanned ground vehicles. To improve the robustness of the systems and enable intelligent tasks, researchers introduced learning-based recognition modules into visual odometry systems, but didn't realize tight coupling between visual odometry systems and recognition modules. This paper proposes a self-supervised semantic visual odometry method, which can complete the tasks of ego-motion estimation, depth prediction, and instance segmentation with a shared encoder. The potential dynamic regions are removed and the image reconstruction loss is rectified by instance detection results. Moreover, the instance-guided triplet loss and cross-task self-attention modules are devised to learn the geometrical relationships among pixels that are implied in instance object priors. The proposed method is validated on KITTI and ComplexUrban datasets. The experimental results show that our method has superiority to baseline models in both pose estimation and depth prediction. We also discuss the efficacy of evaluation metrics for pose estimation, and consider the accumulation errors of trajectories.

### [GET-Zero: Graph Embodiment Transformer for Zero-Shot Embodiment Generalization]()

This paper introduces GET-Zero, a model architecture and training procedure for learning an embodiment-aware control policy that can immediately adapt to new hardware changes without retraining. To do so, we present Graph Embodiment Transformer (GET), a transformer model that leverages the embodiment graph connectivity as a learned structural bias in the attention mechanism. We use behavior cloning to distill demonstration data from embodiment-specific expert policies into an embodiment-aware GET model that conditions on the hardware configuration of the robot to make control decisions. We conduct a case study on a dexterous in-hand object rotation task using different configurations of a four-fingered robot hand with joints removed and with link length extensions. Using the GET model along with a self-modeling loss enables GET-Zero to zero-shot generalize to unseen variation in graph structure and link length, yielding a 20% improvement over baseline methods. All code and qualitative video results are on our project website https://get-zero-paper.github.io.

### [Proprioceptive Object Shape and Size Extraction Via In-Hand-Manipulation with a Variable Friction Robot Gripper]()

Robotic manipulation tasks commonly rely on computer vision or tactile sensing to extract the physical characteristics of an object. However, this additional sensing capability adds complexity and financial cost to a robotic system. Our work investigates the inexpensive alternative of feature extraction via proprioceptive sensing. Our goal is to determine whether proprioceptive data combined with in-hand-manipulation provides sufficient information to enable geometric reconstruction of object profiles. We use a newly designed 3-DOF robotic gripper with variable-friction finger surfaces to perform model-free in-hand-anipulation on a set of test objects comprised of two dimensional convex prisms. We have devised a manipulation sequence based on the rotation and sliding of test objects to allow side-counting with the successful measurement of shapes and sizes with average angle and size errors of 1.64% and 6.76% respectively. In addition, we have outlined potential research directions aimed at resolving inherent limitations of proprioceptive approaches and making our algorithm generalisable to any arbitrary shape.

### [Diffusion-Informed Probabilistic Contact Search for Multi-Finger Manipulation]()

Planning contact-rich interactions for multi-finger manipulation is challenging due to the high-dimensionality and hybrid nature of dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have shown promise, but are sensitive to the quality of training data. Combining learning with classical methods like trajectory optimization and search adds additional structure to the problem and domain knowledge in the form of constraints, which can lead to outperforming the data on which models are trained. We present Diffusion-Informed Probabilistic Contact Search (DIPS), which uses an A* search to plan a sequence of contact modes informed by a diffusion model. We train the diffusion model on a dataset of demonstrations consisting of contact modes and trajectories generated by a trajectory optimizer given those modes. In addition, we use a particle filter-inspired method to reason about variability in diffusion sampling arising from model error, estimating likelihoods of trajectories using a learned discriminator. We show that our method outperforms ablations that do not reason about variability and can plan contact sequences that outperform those found in training data across multiple tasks. We evaluate on simulated tabletop card sliding and screwdriver turning tasks, as well as the screwdriver task in hardware to show that our combined learning and planning approach transfers to the real world.

### [Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects Via Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning]()

Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due to the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an alternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and versatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the hard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to regular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the policy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for any target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data collection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning method with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data. With the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and non-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within 2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data collection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific policies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error being 2.676 mm and 1.902°.

### [From Simple to Complex Skills: The Case of In-Hand Object Reorientation]()

Learning policies in simulation and transferring them to the real world has become a promising approach in dexterous manipulation. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification. In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information, low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the object's pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects, including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose.

### [DROP: Dextereous Reorientation Via Online Planning]()

Achieving human-like dexterity is a longstanding challenge in robotics, in part due to the complexity of planning and control for contact-rich systems. In reinforcement learning (RL), one popular approach has been to use massively-parallelized, domain-randomized simulations to learn a policy offline over a vast array of contact conditions, allowing robust sim-to-real transfer. Inspired by recent advances in real-time parallel simulation, this work considers instead the viability of online planning methods for contact-rich manipulation by studying the well-known in-hand cube reorientation task. We propose a simple architecture that employs a sampling-based predictive controller and vision-based pose estimator to search for contact-rich control actions online. We conduct thorough experiments to assess the real-world performance of our method, architectural design choices, and key factors for robustness, demonstrating that our simple sampled-based approach achieves performance comparable to prior RL-based works.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic 3D Human Motion Forecasting Via Invertible Networks]()

3D human motion forecasting aims to enable autonomous applications. Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions, allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.

### [MonLog: MONotonic-Constrained LOGistic Regressions for Automated Safety Curve Design]()

The increasing integration of robots in close human environments necessitates robust safety measures that can adapt to evolving tasks and conditions. Current standards rely on task-specific safety evaluations that are often inflexible, requiring repeated assessments whenever task parameters change. This work proposes MonLog, a data-driven, probabilistic method to automatically derive safety curves (SCs) from recent injury protection data sets. By leveraging non-linear modeling techniques, our approach addresses the limitations of conventional linear SCs, which often result in overly conservative speed restrictions. We present a comprehensive test routine to validate our method, highlighting improvements in both compliance with safety constraints and operational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed approach not only enhances safety but also optimizes robotic performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### [Passivity Filters for Bilateral Teleoperation with Variable Impedance Control]()

In robotic teleoperation, it is crucial to be able to dynamically adjust interactions with the environment. Drawing inspiration from human behavior during interactions, Variable Impedance Control (VIC) has been widely adopted to enhance robotic flexibility and adaptability. However, maintaining the passivity of such control systems remains a critical safety concern. This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for passive variable impedance control in bilateral teleoperation, combining the advantages of Passivity Filters (PFs), Time-Domain Passivity (TDP) control, and Passive-Set-Position-Modulation (PSPM). The method solves an optimization problem aimed at dissipating the energy that could lead to a lack of passivity. The proposed method is assessed through experiments, illustrating its ability to keep the teleoperation system passive and safe under a variable impedance profile.

### [Robots That Learn to Safely Influence Via Prediction-Informed Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games]()

Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently: autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a robot's ability to influence can also compromise the physical safety of nearby people if naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE (Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional (39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate during task execution.

### [Multi-Layered Safety of Redundant Robot Manipulators Via Task-Oriented Planning and Control]()

Ensuring safety is crucial to promote the application of robot manipulators in open workspaces. Factors such as sensor errors or unpredictable collisions make the environment full of uncertainties. In this work, we investigate these potential safety challenges on redundant robot manipulators, and propose a task-oriented planning and control framework to achieve multi-layered safety while maintaining efficient task execution. Our approach consists of two main parts: a task-oriented trajectory planner based on multiple-shooting model predictive control (MPC) method, and a torque controller that allows safe and efficient collision reaction using only proprioceptive data. Through extensive simulations and real-hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively handle uncertain static or dynamic obstacles, and perform disturbance resistance in manipulation tasks when unforeseen contacts occur.

### [A Multi-Task Energy-Aware Impedance Controller for Enhanced Safety in Physical Human-Robot Interaction]()

In physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), ensuring human safety in all tasks conducted by the robot is crucial. Traditional compliance control strategies, such as admittance and impedance control, often lead to unpredictable robot behavior due to incidents like contact loss or unexpected external forces, which can cause significant harm to humans. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a multi-task energy-aware impedance controller for kinematically redundant robots. This controller extends the energy-aware impedance control strategy, which ensures the passivity and safety of a single task using a virtual global energy tank, to kinematically redundant robots performing multiple tasks. The proposed controller effectively regulates the power flow of all tasks performed by the robot through a single global energy tank, ensuring the safety and passivity of the tasks.Experimental results in a shared environment, where external forces are simultaneously applied to the end-effector and the third joint of the Franka Emika Panda, showed that the robot's energy and power, as well as the power of all tasks, consistently remained within predefined thresholds. Additionally, when comparing the proposed controllers with controller that do not consider null space projection in the power regulation stage and controller that do not regulate the robot's power, our approach effectively managed the robot's energy and power and the power of all tasks, ensuring passivity and enhanced safety.

### [A Parameter-Efficient Tuning Framework for Language-Guided Object Grounding and Robot Grasping]()

The language-guided robot grasping task requires a robot agent to integrate multimodal information from both visual and linguistic inputs to predict actions for target-driven grasping. While recent approaches utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their extensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local deployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based multimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three language-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA). Our approach introduces two key innovations: a bi-directional vision-language adapter that aligns multimodal inputs for pixel-level language understanding and a depth fusion branch that incorporates geometric cues to facilitate robot grasping predictions. Experiment results demonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with existing CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA tasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on simple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending complex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present in the workspace.

### [Cascaded Diffusion Models for Neural Motion Planning]()

Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving textit{local} planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (approx 5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.

### [Reinforcement Learning with Lie Group Orientations for Robotics]()

Handling orientations of robots and objects is a crucial aspect of many applications. Yet, ever so often, there is a lack of mathematical correctness when dealing with orientations, especially in learning pipelines involving, for example, artificial neural networks. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning with orientations and propose a simple modification of the network's input and output that adheres to the Lie group structure of orientations. As a result, we obtain a practically efficient implementation that is directly usable with existing learning libraries and achieves significantly better performance than other common orientation representations. We briefly introduce Lie theory specifically for orientations in robotics to motivate and outline our approach. Subsequently, a thorough empirical evaluation of different combinations of orientation representations for states and actions demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach in different scenarios, including: direct orientation control, end effector orientation control, and pick-and-place tasks.

### [DexTouch: Learning to Seek and Manipulate Objects with Tactile Dexterity]()

The sense of touch is an essential ability for skillfully performing a variety of tasks, providing the capacity to search and manipulate objects without relying on visual information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-finger robot system designed to manipulate objects using the sense of touch, without relying on vision. For tasks that mimic daily life, the robot uses its sense of touch to manipulate randomly placed objects in dark. The objective of this study is to enable robots to perform manipulation without vision by using tactile sensation to compensate for the information gap caused by the absence of vision, given the presence of prior information. Training the policy through reinforcement learning in simulation and transferring the trained policy to the real environment,we demonstrate that manipulationwithout visual input can be applied to robots without vision. In addition, the experiments showcase the importance of tactile sensing in tasks performed without vision. Our project page is available at https://lee-kangwon.github.io/dextouch/

### [Catch It! Learning to Catch in Flight with Mobile Dexterous Hands]()

Catching objects in flight (i.e., thrown objects) is a common daily skill for humans, yet it presents a significant challenge for robots. This task requires a robot with agile and accurate motion, a large spatial workspace, and the ability to interact with diverse objects. In this paper, we build a mobile manipulator composed of a mobile base, a 6-DoF arm, and a 12-DoF dexterous hand to tackle such a challenging task. We propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework to efficiently train a whole-body-control catching policy for this high-DoF system in simulation. The objects' throwing configurations, shapes, and sizes are randomized during training to enhance policy adaptivity to various trajectories and object characteristics in flight. The results show that our trained policy catches diverse objects with randomly thrown trajectories, at a high success rate of about 80% in simulation, with a significant improvement over the baselines. The policy trained in simulation can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, which achieves catching sandbags in various shapes, randomly thrown by humans.

### [Adaptive Complexity Model Predictive Control]()

This work introduces a formulation of model predictive control (MPC) which adaptively reasons about the complexity of the model while maintaining feasibility and stability guarantees. Existing approaches often handle computational complexity by shortening prediction horizons or simplifying models, both of which can result in instability. Inspired by related approaches in behavioral economics, motion planning, and biomechanics, our method solves MPC problems with a simple model for dynamics and constraints over regions of the horizon where such a model is feasible and a complex model where it is not. The approach leverages an interleaving of planning and execution to iteratively identify these regions, which can be safely simplified if they satisfy an exact template/anchor relationship. We show that this method does not compromise the stability and feasibility properties of the system, and measure performance in simulation experiments on a quadrupedal robot executing agile behaviors over terrains of interest. We find that this adaptive method enables more agile motion (55% increase in top speed) and expands the range of executable tasks compared to fixed-complexity implementations.

### [Benchmarking Different QP Formulations and Solvers for Dynamic Quadrupedal Walking]()

Quadratic Programs (QPs) are widely used in the control of walking robots, especially in Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Whole-Body Control (WBC). In both cases, the controller design requires the formulation of a QP and the selection of a suitable QP solver, both requiring considerable time and expertise. While computational performance benchmarks exist for QP solvers, studies comparing optimal combinations of computational hardware (HW), QP formulation, and solver performance are lacking. In this work, we compare dense and sparse QP formulations, and multiple solving methods on different HW architectures, focusing on their computational efficiency in dynamic walking of four-legged robots using MPC. We introduce the Solve Frequency per Watt (SFPW) as a performance measure to enable a cross-hardware comparison of the efficiency of QP solvers. We also benchmark different QP solvers for WBC that we use for trajectory stabilization in quadrupedal walking. As a result, this paper recommends a starting point for practitioners on the selection of QP formulations and solvers for different HW architectures in walking robots and indicates which problems should be devoted the greater technical effort.

### [Indoor and Outdoor Multi-Terrain Stair-Climbing Robot Design]()

This paper introduces an Autonomous Mobile Robot (IOMT) designed for indoor and outdoor multi-terrain environments. The robot features a four-wheel independent drive and steering system (4WID-4WIS), allowing it to maintain high maneuverability on smooth surfaces. Additionally, based on reducing the control complexity, the IOMT addresses the challenges associated with stair climbing by providing stable pitch control, which effectively reduces the impact of stairs on the robot’s posture like pitch angle. The design also incorporates a special mechanism which reducing energy consumption through its worm gear system with self-locking characteristics, and combining steering with shock absorption to simplify both the mechanism complexity. This paper not only proposes a stair climbing strategy for the IOMT configuration but also explores the impact of various design parameters on the robot’s pitch angle, ultimately validating the feasibility and development potential of the design for multi-terrain mobility.

### [WaLTER: A Wheel and Leg Tumbling Expedition Robot]()

For effective operation in challenging outdoor environments, mobile unmanned robots face stiff and competing demands including payload capacity, driving speed, range, as well as the ability to traverse rough terrain. To address these issues we introduce the hybrid wheel-leg quadrupedal robot WaLTER. WaLTER utilizes a unique combination of continuously rotating distal leg joints, actuated wheels, and a roll body DOF to efficiently drive on flat ground and effectively tumble over stairs and difficult, broken terrain. We developed intuitive teleoperation scheme and a employed deep reinforcement learning as proof of concept control techniques for the novel morphology. To test its capabilities, we constructed a multi-body simulation in MuJoCo and a 2.1-kg physical prototype for experimentation on traversability and energy economy. Our testing demonstrated the ability to traverse rougher terrain negotiation relative to larger-wheeled counterparts and reliable stair-climbing while maintaining a 4km range on a 24.4 Wh battery (COT: 1.21).

### [Deformable Multibody Modeling for Model Predictive Control in Legged Locomotion with Embodied Compliance]()

The paper presents a method to stabilize dynamic gait for a legged robot with embodied compliance. Our approach introduces a unified description for rigid and compliant bodies to approximate their deformation and a formulation for deformable multibody systems. We develop the centroidal composite predictive deformed inertia (CCPDI) tensor of a deformable multibody system and show how to integrate it with the standard-of-practice model predictive controller (MPC). Simulation shows that the resultant control framework can stabilize trot stepping on a quadrupedal robot with both rigid and compliant spines under the same MPC configurations. Compared to standard MPC, the developed CCPDI-enabled MPC distributes the ground reactive forces closer to the heuristics for body balance, and it is thus more likely to stabilize the gaits of the compliant robot. A parametric study shows that our method preserves some robustness within a suitable envelope of key parameter values.

### [Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing]()

Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.

### [Large Language Models As Natural Selector for Embodied Soft Robot Design]()

Designing soft robots is a complex and iterative process that demands cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, mechanics, and control, often relying on intuition and extensive experimentation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to learn and apply embodied design principles—crucial for creating functional robotic systems—remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. We further demonstrate the practical utility of LLMs for robot design initialization. Our code and benchmark will be available to encourage the community to foster this exciting research direction.

### [Toward Embedded LLM-Guided Navigation and Object Detection for Aerial Robots]()

This work presents a novel framework that integrates natural language understanding with autonomous quadrotor navigation and object detection, aiming toward fully embedded, language-driven autonomy. Our long-term objective is to develop efficient and lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) deployable on edge platforms such as the ModalAI Seeker drone. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a pre-trained LLaMA model on a custom dataset composed of natural language commands for exploration and object localization. The proposed system adopts a hierarchical architecture: the LLM interprets high-level language instructions and translates them into task-level goals, which are then executed via onboard modules including visual-inertial odometry (VIO)-based control, path planning, and real-time object detection. To evaluate the framework, we design a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed using the ModalAI Seeker platform, enabling closed-loop validation in realistic scenarios. In our current setup, LLM inference runs on an offboard workstation equipped with an RTX 4090 GPU, while the drone autonomously handles the perception and control stack.This poster demonstrates a proof-of-concept toward scalable, natural language-based human-robot interaction in real-world environments.

### [Deep Learning Model Enables Prediction of Future Physiological States During Perturbed Locomotion]()

Falling is the leading cause of injury related death in older adults. Exoskeletons have the potential to augment balance to reduce fall rate, however, classical control strategies are not well suited for transient movements. Recently, a deep learning-based task-agnostic controller based on the user’s physiological state was shown to decrease metabolic cost across cyclic and non-cyclic tasks, showing this controller’s ability to generalize. However, the effectiveness of this approach for perturbation recovery has not been investigated. We anticipate that the timing of joint moment-driven exoskeleton assistance will differ for approaches that aim to augment balance. Metabolic cost-reducing approaches apply joint moment assistance that is delayed relative to the user’s joint moment, while faster-than-human assistance has proven beneficial for balance augmentation. The aim of this study is to optimize a deep learning model that predicts future joint moments, enabling faster-than-human control. We trained a series of temporal convolutional networks that used wearable IMUs (pelvis, torso, and bilateral dorsal foot, shank, thighs) to predict joint moments. We trained models that forecasted joint moments 0ms (estimation at current time), 40ms, 80ms, and 120ms into the future. We found that model R2 were above 0.8 for most forecasts, a threshold previously shown to allow for highly controllable exoskeletons. This controller shows potential to assist perturbed locomotion

### [FireantV3 Geometry and Locomotion Simplifies Localization in Self-Assembled Structures]()

Accurate localization plays a key role in swarm robotics, especially for algorithms towards modular and self-assembling robotic (MSR) systems, where knowing the shape of the self-assembled structure is often important. However, most methods for achieving localization in MSR systems rely on known offsets of robots within a lattice, and thus are not useful for free-form MSR systems. Work towards localizing in free-form systems has thus far required complex sensor arrays and extensive global coordination. In this work, we introduce a 3D localization approach for FireAntV3 robots that relies solely on local communication between robots. The robots rely on contact-based sensing using vibration to identify neighboring robots and communicate information. In the simulation-based investigation we present here, the first robot serves as an origin reference that robots localize off of as they move about the structure while executing the ReactiveBuild algorithm. The ability to localize contacts between the three spheres of the FireAntV3 robots and the discrete nature of robot locomotion provides ample information for robots to use in a gradient descent localization algorithm. With the presented method we find that the average absolute localization error across a 100 robot structure with no larger than two dock radius, demonstrating the utility of the presented approach.

### [Let's Make a Splan: Risk-Aware Trajectory Optimization in a Normalized Gaussian Splat]()

Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have recently transformed computer vision by enabling photo-realistic representations of complex scenes. However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator. A project page is available at https://roahmlab.github.io/splanning.

### [Analyzing the Limitations of Imitation Learning for Autonomous Surgical Robot Environments]()

As the field of supervised machine learning continues to evolve, imitation learning (IL) emerges as a promising alternative to reinforcement learning (RL) for training autonomous surgical robotic agents. In particular, Transformer-based models such as the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) show potential to robustly clone expert demonstrations that require fine-grained manipulation while bypassing the need for bridging the simulation-to-reality gap experienced in training RL policies. This study systematically investigates the limitations and challenges associated with using ACT-based IL for learning surgically relevant tasks on a simulated and real da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Through a series of controlled experiments using simulated and real dVRK setups, this work evaluates the sensitivity of ACT models to environmental and architectural factors such as lighting, demonstration quality, and chunk size hyperparameter choices. Baseline accuracies of manipulation tasks are presented, along with experiments assessing model robustness under distractors and visual inconsistencies. The findings highlight the critical importance of dataset quality and lighting consistency in achieving successful behaviour cloning. While IL proves viable for certain structured tasks under controlled conditions, the study outlines clear limitations and identifies future directions to improve generalization and robustness of learned policies for real-world surgical deployment.

### [Structured Noise for Better State-Conditioned Diffusion ​ in Robotic Motion Planning​]()

In diffusion-based motion planning, the standard use of zero-mean isotropic Gaussian noise may overlook an opportunity to encode task-relevant structure into the generative process. We explore a simple yet effective modification: replacing the standard noise with a non-standard Gaussian distribution—specifically, a Gaussian mixture—whose mode-specific mean and covariance encode desirable properties of the trajectory, such as smoothness and state conditioning. We begin by deriving a forward diffusion formulation using general, non-standard Gaussian noise. We then derive corresponding reverse denoising formulations, both for neural-network-based and model-based diffusion models. Finally, we propose a specific design for the mean and covariance structure—realized through the Gaussian mixture components—to encode trajectory priors.When applied to robot motion planning with both types of diffusion models, our structured noise formulation improves the quality of the generated trajectories compared to the baselines using standard Gaussian noise.

### [Task-Dependent Grasp Metric with Object and Manipulator Dynamics]()

Grasp evaluation is a key aspect of many grasp planning algorithms. This paper introduces a novel optimization framework as a second-order cone program (SOCP) for evaluating a grasp's ability to perform the task. We formalize the notion of a manipulation task as a constant screw motion (or a sequence of constant screw motions) to be applied to the object after grasping. Our proposed task-dependent grasp metric evaluates a grasp's ability to generate force/moment to impart the desired constant screw motion. A key distinguishing feature of our grasp metric is its ability to incorporate the manipulator and object dynamics. It also considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the object-robot and the object-environment contact. Since our proposed quality measure is an SOCP, it can be solved optimally using interior point methods. We present simulation results for the task of pivoting, showing the effectiveness of our approach.

### [STITCHER: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Motion Primitive Search]()

Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible, collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).

### [STATE-NAV: Stability-Aware Traversability Estimation for Bipedal Navigation Over Rough Terrain]()

Bipedal robots have advantages in human-centered environments but face greater failure risk compared to more stable morphologies such as wheeled or quadrupedal robots. While learning-based traversability has been widely explored for these platforms, bipedal traversability has largely been addressed using heuristic methods, with limited consideration for instability on rough terrain. In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and safe navigation framework tailored to bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments. We train our transformer-based neural network to predict bipedal locomotion instability in a risk-sensitive manner, enabling safer locomotion. Based on the predicted instability, we define traversability as stability-aware command velocity—the fastest velocity that can keep instability below a user-defined limit. This velocity-based traversability is intergrated into a hierarchical planner, combining RRT* for finding time-efficient global path planning and MPC for the safe execution. We validate our method in MuJoCo simulation, demonstrating improved safety and navigation performance, with enhanced robustness across varying terrains compared to traditional baselines.

### [Congestion Mitigation for Foraging Robot Swarms Using Trajectory Analysis and Adaptive Spiral Path Strategies]()

As foraging robot swarms grow in size, congestion and inter-robot collisions become critical challenges, especially in high-traffic areas like the resource collection zone where robots drop off collected resources. This work aims to mitigate congestion through trajectory analysis and adaptive spiral path strategies. The focus was to enhance resource collection efficiency while reducing inter-robot collisions. A data-driven method was developed using 112 simulated robot trajectories, which were analyzed to extract key movement features. These features fed into a logistic regression model that detects congestion with approximately 93% accuracy, enabling real-time behavior adjustments. Initial results demonstrate substantial improvements through the use of adaptive spiral paths, like square and circular spirals, where robots enter these paths when congestion is detected. Resource delivery rates increased by over 120%, and collision time decreased by 21%, validating the method’s effectiveness. This research underscores the potential of dynamic behavior modification to improve scalability and coordination in swarm robotics.

### [Vision-Language Action Models for Autonomous Liver Ultrasound: A Comparative Study of π0 and Transformer-Based Policies]()

Building on advancements in Vision Language Models, researchers have adapted these into Vision Language Action (VLA) models to achieve state-of-the-art results on various robotic manipulation benchmarks. We present the application of the recently released π0 model pretrained on 10,000 hours of robotic data and fine-tune it to perform a cursory survey of the liver. As a baseline, we compare against trained Action Chunking Transformers (ACT). Both methods were trained on 175 ultrasound sweeps representing approximately an hour of data acquired on a tissue mimicking phantom. The methods were then evaluated based on their ability to achieve targeted views during initial contact as well as during the middle and end of the scan. The π0 policy had a higher success rate in acquiring each of these three views. The most challenging target was the initial contact where π0 was successful 47% of the time, compared to only 7% with ACT. The success rate for π0 and ACT was 67% vs 33% and 60% vs 33% for the middle and end scan views respectively. These preliminary results show the potential value of foundational VLA models in autonomous ultrasound acquisitions, an area characterized by many highly complex tasks and where obtaining large numbers of expert demonstrations is difficult. While imitation learning has been applied to robotic ultrasound acquisitions before, to our knowledge, this work represents the first use of VLA in robotic ultrasound.

### [Learning Precise Robot Motion from Demonstration with Constraint-Aware Refinement]()

We present a modular system for generating precise robot motion from human demonstrations with constraint-aware refinement. Targeting flexible, precision assembly tasks in small-to-medium factories, our system addresses key challenges in motion planning, data collection, and execution reliability. Demonstrations are captured in real time using a portable teaching interface equipped with GoPro camera, HTC Vive tracking and encoder-based gripper sensing, supporting physical, simulated, and real-robot teleoperation modes. Motion generation follows a two-step approach: (1) learning an initial trajectory using GMM/GMR or a diffusion policy, and (2) refining it via constrained nonlinear optimization that ensures goal accuracy and adherence to robot limits. Compared to GMM/GMR, diffusion better captures multi-modal behavior and generalizes to unseen conditions. The refinement stage significantly improves precision and constraint satisfaction. Experiments show GMM/GMR method learned unimodal behavior only, and failed on distant test cases (from demonstration). The optimization-based refinement improved success rate but didn’t guarantee success for all test cases. The diffusion model, however, learned multimodal behavior, and the refinement ensured success in all test cases, highlighting the system’s effectiveness for generalizable, high-precision robotic tasks.

### [Understanding Human Fall from Standing Via Whole-Body Musculoskeletal Simulation]()

Understanding human balancing and falling is crucial for advancing the design of assistive robots and human-like bipedal robots. This study uses a high-dimensional musculoskeletal model with a comprehensive set of skeletal muscles to simulate the transition from standing to falling. We investigate the intrinsic temporal dynamics, motor responses, and the distribution of related metrics across the human body during loss of balance. Through large-scale simulations, we identify a central stability region in front of the feet where center-of-mass trajectories converge, and demonstrate that backward and lateral leaning are associated with increased fall risk. Under fall-prone conditions, such as muscle weakness and neural control latency, we observe shorter fall durations and more consistent fall patterns. Contact analysis reveals frequent collisions at the pelvis, thigh, and head, consistent with clinical observations of hip and head injuries. These findings contribute to a more quantitative understanding of human balancing and falling, and provide insights for the design of bio-inspired control strategies and fall prevention systems.

### [Spin Swimmer: A Fast, Efficient and Agile Fish-Like Robot]()

Underwater roboticists have long aimed to replicate the remarkable swimming capabilities of fish, combining speed, efficiency, and agility. To achieve this engineers and robotocists have focused their efforts on the design of soft or articulated multi-body tails that can oscillate or undulate at frequencies and amplitudes similar to those of the fish they seek to mimic. Such kinematic approaches do not account for the complex interaction of the efficiency of actuation, dynamic response of flexible appendages, and hydrodynamic forces. This work presents a fundamentally novel means of mechanical actuation: a fast spinning unbalanced rotor internal to the body of the robot, that transfers a periodic axial force to an otherwise passive flexible tail.	The net result is that the tail acts as a parametric oscillator that undergoes a 2:1 subharmonic resonance. High tail-beat frequencies are achieved with minimal input power due to this parametric resonance. The resulting robot has the lowest cost of transport amongst free swimming robots while also being fast, extremely agile and gyroscopically roll and pitch stable. The results demonstrate the importance of exploiting parametric resonances in designing efficient fish-like robots.

### [Multi-Sensor Wearable Systems for Proactive Fall Risk Assessment]()

This study presents an AI-based wearable system for proactive fall risk prediction in older adults. The system integrates IMUs and pressure sensors at key anatomical locations to continuously monitor gait patterns. Using temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and LSTM neural networks, the system analyzes spatiotemporal features to predict fall risk. Cross-dataset validation demonstrated 91% mean accuracy (±3%) with an AUC of 0.92, while a pilot study with 20 older adults showed 88% accuracy. The TCN model achieved 89% sensitivity and 93% specificity, with a 30% reduction in false alarms compared to single-sensor systems. This technology enables early detection of fall risk indicators weeks or months before incidents occur, allowing for timely interventions that can improve health outcomes and extend independence for older adults, ultimately reducing healthcare costs associated with fall-related injuries.

### [Myoelectric Spatiotemporal Fusion for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction]()

The application of gesture recognition in human-robot interaction (HRI) demands high levels of robustness and accuracy, while controlling model computational speed and memory usage. Currently, deep learning-based methods for muscle activity feature extraction fail to effectively capture spatiotemporal information from electromyography(EMG) signals, potentially leading to the curse of dimensionality. This paper introduces a novel temporal and cross-channel convolutional neural network (TCCNN) algorithm to process EMG signals and enhance the accuracy and robustness of gesture recognition. TCCNN utilizes a circular concatenation and cross-channel learning approach to extract EMG data correlations between muscle fibers and their adjacent fibers. By integrating parallel and serial processing methods to obtain fused spatiotemporal features, the proposed algorithm improves feature extraction capabilities. In offline experiments containing 17 gestures with 10 subjects, TCCNN achieved a gesture recognition accuracy of 95.21% and significantly outperformed baseline models in recall rates. Online tests further confirmed the system's low latency and natural interaction quality, demonstrating its suitability for real-world HRI applications.

### [Integration of Vision, Language, and Video-Based Learning for Robotic Tasks]()

This research presents a novel framework for integrating vision, language, and video-based learning to enhance robotic task execution in dynamic environments. Current robotics systems struggle with generalizing task execution across different scenarios due to limitations in multimodal learning capabilities. Our approach addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive architecture that enables robots to learn task representations from diverse input modalities autonomously. The proposed framework consists of three primary components: (1) a Vision-Language Model incorporating object detection, semantic segmentation, and visual question answering for scene understanding; (2) a Video Understanding Module extracting action sequences, object interactions, and workflows from demonstrations; and (3) a Task Representation Framework synthesizing multimodal inputs into unified representations for planning. Large Language Models provide reasoning capabilities to generate adaptive task plans, while reinforcement learning optimizes execution based on simulation and real-world feedback.Our experimental methodology includes system validation using the Reachy humanoid robot with camera and microphone inputs and human-robot interaction studies to evaluate adaptation to user feedback. Implemented using PyTorch, OpenCV, and ROS2, with models trained, the system will be evaluated in both Isaac SIM environments and real-world scenarios.

### [Gaussian Mixture Koopman Kalman Filter: Application to a Closed Koopman System]()

This work extends the Koopman Kalman Filter (KKF), a method that leverages Koopman operator theory to represent nonlinear dynamical systems in a lifted space with linear evolution. By modeling the extended state as a joint Gaussian distribution, KKF enables the use of classical linear filtering tools for nonlinear estimation. Building on this foundation, we explore richer probabilistic representations within the same Koopman-based framework. In particular, we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model variant (GMMKKF), where the extended state is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians. Each component evolves under globally linear models, enabling efficient inference in systems with significant nonlinearity. Compared to traditional approaches like the Extended Kalman Filter—which relies on local linearizations and unimodal Gaussian beliefs—our method captures multimodal uncertainty for nonlinear evolving systems, while retaining computational tractability. This filtering perspective offers a principled and scalable approach to nonlinear state estimation.

### [Infrastructure Inspection with Robots and 3D Reconstruction Methods: A Comparative Study of Computer Vision Algorithms]()

This study evaluates the feasibility of using 3D reconstruction methods based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM), such as 3D Meshing and 3D Gaussian Splatting, as complementary tools for surface inspection in industrial and civil infrastructure settings. Our focus is on detecting small-scale and fine defects (e.g. cracks, scuffs, edge chips) with high accuracy. Our approach consists of taking several pictures of an object using a single RGB camera mounted on an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot. Then, we benchmarked the defect representation accuracy of the 3D reconstruction methods through a set of feature detection methods based on Computer Vision (CV), covering both Classical CV (e.g. Canny edge detection, contour detection, etc.) as well as Modern CV (e.g. Class-Activation Map (CAM) based on CNNs).

### [Flow Matching Architecture for Navigation]()

This work explores a multimodal approach for generating instantaneous, collision-free trajectories for robotic navigation in novel environments. By utilizing RGB and sparse point cloud data, we aim to enhance environmental awareness and navigation performance. Our focus is on developing a model that maintains a robust performance across unseen settings integrating both Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Transformer-based bottleneck models. Initial results demonstrate the potential of fusing RGB and point cloud modalities for an effective navigation. The model is initially validated in the PushT simulation environment, lowering the number of parameters of existing baselines in typical Diffusion Policies. However, the absence of a Joint multi-modal encoder for native fusion of raw modalities presents a key limitation. Future work will address this by integrating such a component and incorporating online reinforcement learning to enable real-time trajectory correction. We plan to validate our approach through deployment on a modified Shuttle Personnel Carrier EG6088K, equipped with a Velodyne HDL-32 and Multisense S21 camera, in a dynamic outdoor environment.

### [Generalized Gimbal Construction: Algorithmic Design of Kinematic Chains with No Self-Collision in Any Configuration]()

We present a linear-time design algorithm mapping any sequence of axes of motion to a kinematic chain design implementing those axes, arranged such that no configurations have self-collision. Specifically, the algorithm is responsible for placing each joint in a specific pose on its axis of motion and finding link shapes connecting them. The core idea generalizes the structure of gimbals to deal with axes of motion that do not all intersect at a point: the algorithm maintains a bounding sphere about everything generated so far such that the sphere centers on the previous axis of motion, then routes outside this sphere to place and connect to the next joint. The algorithm is enabled by abstracting mechanism thickness as a bounding radius and thus link shapes as tubes defined by their centerline paths. Since a tube cannot bend faster than its own radius, turning the link design problem into a Dubins planning problem. Proof of the algorithm provides justification for using this tubular abstraction in computational design of linkages, showing that restricting the design space in this way makes it tractable to explore but still fully kinematically expressive. The algorithm is also useful as an initialization to be further optimized for compactness or other properties. We have a preliminary approach to sequentially re-arrange joints (preserving their axes of motion) and link waypoints to minimize chain length while maintaining self-collision avoidance in the neutral configuration.

### [Towards Mobile Robotic Optical Coherence Tomography for Practical Clinical Imaging]()

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an indispensable technology in ophthalmology for diagnosing and managing eye disease and requires patients who can sit upright and participate in imaging. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a mobile and motion-tolerant robotic OCT system that is capable of versatile use in both outpatient and inpatient clinical environments and is suitable for imaging in diverse clinical configurations. Our system includes a robot arm and a vertical lift, and is equipped with real-time nested MPPI motion planning algorithms for face and pupil movement tracking and obstacle collision avoidance during the imaging process. To enhance motion tolerance, we implement the model-free autoregressive filter-based active cancellation for eye movement. Motion cancellation aiming offsets are derived from filter predictions instead of relying on the last observed eye position. We validate the system’s workspace, dynamic tracking, and obstacle avoidance capabilities and then evaluate the effectiveness of predictive cancellation using a retinal eye phantom on a motorized stage to simulate jerk nystagmus. Predictive scan aiming stabilized repeated B-scans and retained contrast within retinal structures, which correspond to higher mean brightness, while residual motion is observed during traditional scan aiming. The combination of these results enables us to move toward clinical deployment in the near future.

### [RKHS Gaussian Splatting SLAM]()

Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have enabled visually appealing and computationally efficient scene representations for robotics applications. However, while these approaches deliver high visual fidelity, they often fall short in preserving the geometric accuracy required for robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), particularly in tasks such as manipulation and autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce RKHS GS SLAM, a novel RGBD SLAM system that leverages a 3D-GS-based non-correspondence registration algorithm, augmented with a robust loop closure module and global pose optimization framework. Unlike conventional point cloud registration methods, our approach integrates covariance and feature information inherent to the 3D-GS representation, thereby preserving both visual and geometric properties even when employing a sparser mapping strategy. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets reveal that our sparse 3D-GS mapping retains most of the performance of dense mappings while reducing the number of Gaussians by 80%. Furthermore, our registration algorithm demonstrates improved tracking accuracy when compared to traditional point cloud registration and rendering-based pose optimization techniques. These results highlight the potential of 3D-GS for efficient and precise SLAM in complex robotic applications.

### [Learning PID Gains for Planar Tracking of Bio-Inspired Swimming Robots Using Simplified Models]()

The rising demand for autonomous systems capable of operating in complex marine environments has led to growing interest in underwater and bio-inspired fish-like robots, with applications in environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and offshore inspection. However, accurately modeling and controlling these robots remains a major challenge due to nonlinear fluid-structure interactions, high degrees of freedom, and the unsteady nature of underwater dynamics. To address these complexities, reduced-order models that capture the essential system dynamics offer a promising balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time control. While kinematic models have been widely used in fish-like robots, dynamic models remain relatively scarce, particularly in the context of control.In this work, we develop a reduced-order dynamic model based on a modified Chaplygin Sleigh tailored to an underactuated, internally actuated fish-like robot driven by a reaction wheel. This model serves as the basis for a control framework in which we use data-driven methods and reinforcement learning to tune control gains in order to track a planar trajectory in an efficient and optimal manner. The approach is then validated through implementation and testing on the robotic platform.

### [Imitation Balancing Control Using Human Balancing Skills for a Wheeled Inverted Pendulum Robot with a Fan]()

Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP) robots offer agile mobility but suffer from unstable, underactuated dynamics. To address this, we are developing a Wheeled Inverted Pendulum with a Fan (WIPF), which uses bidirectional fan thrust to achieve full actuation. This study proposes an imitation balancing controller that leverages human balancing skills. A human-machine interface (HMI) synchronizes the human and robot by sending reference trajectories from the human to the robot and providing force feedback based on their state differences. During teleoperation, external disturbances are applied to the robot, and the user responds by balancing it in real time. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) was trained to imitate the human-generated reference trajectory. The proposed controller outperformed traditional Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in both simulations and experiments. Future work will extend to locomotion control and more dynamic movements beyond balancing.

### [Universal Control Barrier Functions for Agile, but Safe, Multi-Robot Control in Dynamic, Cluttered Environments]()

Robots operating in complex human environments must balance two often conflicting objectives: agility and safety. Traditional safety guarantees, while effective at preventing collisions and unsafe behaviors, tend to restrict agile movement and can result in deadlocks in crowded, multi-agent scenarios. This poster introduces Universal Control Barrier Functions (UCBFs), a new class of control-theoretic tools designed to simultaneously ensure safety and prevent deadlocks by introducing Liveness Sets—a novel extension of traditional safety sets. The work demonstrates how UCBFs generalize classical Control Barrier Functions to provide both safety (set invariance) and liveness (ensuring progress), allowing for safe yet fluid motion in real-world dynamic environments. Preliminary simulations and hardware results on quadrupeds and other robots show that UCBFs enable agile behavior without compromising on safety. The framework is further extended to accommodate challenges such as limited actuation, lidar-only perception, decentralized multi-agent coordination, and neural approximations of control. These results underscore the versatility of UCBFs as a foundational control primitive for next-generation robotic systems deployed in cluttered, human-centric spaces.

### [Autonomous Robotic Assistant for Knee Replacement Surgery]()

The emergence of computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aims to reduce post-operative complications by improving surgical accuracy. Leveraging implant geometry and patient-specific bone shape, modern technology enables more precise bone preparation. However, current systems rely on infrared-based tracking for registration, which is invasive, cumbersome, and introduces additional hardware into the sterile field. These systems also impose strict line-of-sight constraints, obstructing critical areas within the surgical field and limiting surgeon mobility. In contrast, our work proposes a vision-based robotic alternative capable of performing accurate registration and autonomously drilling pilot holes for surgical pin placement, without reliance on external tracking hardware. This system represents a step toward fully self-contained surgical robots that simplify operating room setup, reduce intra-operative errors, and improve the accessibility of robotic assistance in orthopedic procedures.

### [AURA: Painted Heart Beats]()

In this work we present AURA, a framework for synergetic human-artist painting. We developed a robot arm that collaboratively paints with a human artist. The robot has an awareness of the artist's heartbeat through the EmotiBit sensor, which provides the arousal levels of the painter. Given the heartbeat detected, the robot decides to increase proximity to the artist's workspace or retract. If a higher heartbeat is detected, which is associated with increased arousal in human artists, the robot will move away from that area of the canvas. If the artist's heart rate is detected as neutral, indicating the human artist's baseline state, the robot will continue its painting actions across the entire canvas. We also demonstrate and propose alternative robot-artist interactions using natural language and physical touch. This work combines the biometrics of a human artist to inform fluent artistic interactions.

### [Time-Correlated Model Predictive Path Integral: Smooth Action Generation for Sampling-Based Control]()

In this paper, we introduce time-correlated model predictive path integral (TC-MPPI), a novel approach to mitigate action noise in sampling-based control methods. Unlike conventional smoothing techniques that rely on post-processing or additional state variables, TC-MPPI directly incorporates temporal correlation of actions into stochastic optimal control, effectively enforcing quadratic costs on action derivatives. This reformulation enables us to generate smooth action sequences without extra modifications, using a time-correlated and conditional Gaussian sampling distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on various robotic platforms, including a pendulum, cart-pole, 2D bicopter, 3D quadcopter, and autonomous vehicle. Simulation videos are available at https://youtu.be/nWfJ2MAV2JI.

### [Gradient-Based Trajectory Optimization with Parallelized Differentiable Traffic Simulation]()

We present a parallelized differentiable traffic simulator based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), a car-following framework that incorporates driver behavior as key variables. Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SonSang/diffidm.

### [Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs]()

Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume, but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer and more efficient autonomous systems.

### [Efficient Trajectory Generation Based on Traversable Planes in 3D Complex Architectural Spaces]()

With the increasing integration of robots into human life, their role in architectural spaces where people spend most of their time has become more prominent. While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.

### [Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking against Adversarial Opponents]()

In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.

### [Learning Time-Optimal Online Replanning for Distributed Model Predictive Contouring Control of Quadrotors]()

Achieving time-optimal flight in real time for multi-drone systems presents significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid responses or aggressive maneuvers. This paper introduces a novel framework that bridges the gap between time-optimal polynomial trajectory generation and optimal control, facilitating efficient online replanning (100 Hz onboard) for multiple quadrotors. Specifically, the proposed method leverages a neural network to learn optimal time allocations for polynomial trajectories, which are then integrated with Model Predictive Contouring Control to fully exploit the dynamics of quadrotors. We further extend this approach to multi-drone systems, enabling collaborative high-speed flight with reciprocal collision avoidance. We benchmark the time-optimal performance and computational efficiency of our method in a drone racing scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in agile cooperative flight within more constrained simulation and real-world environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves agile waypoint traverse at a speed of up to 19 m/s in simulation and up to 9 m/s in two-drone real-world scenario.

### [Predictive Control with Indirect Adaptive Laws for Payload Transportation by Quadrupedal Robots]()

This paper formally develops a novel hierarchical planning and control framework for robust payload transportation by quadrupedal robots, integrating a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a gradient-descent-based adaptive updating law. At the framework's high level, an indirect adaptive law estimates the unknown parameters of the reduced-order (template) locomotion model under varying payloads. These estimated parameters feed into an MPC algorithm for real-time trajectory planning, incorporating a convex stability criterion within the MPC constraints to ensure the stability of the template model's estimation error. The optimal reduced-order trajectories generated by the high-level adaptive MPC (AMPC) are then passed to a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (WBC) for tracking. Extensive numerical investigations validate the framework's capabilities, showcasing the robot's proficiency in transporting unmodeled, unknown static payloads up to 109% in experiments on flat terrains and 91% on rough experimental terrains. The robot also successfully manages dynamic payloads with 73% of its mass on rough terrains. Performance comparisons with a normal MPC and an L1-MPC indicate a significant improvement. Furthermore, comprehensive hardware experiments conducted in indoor and outdoor environments confirm the method’s efficacy on rough terrains despite uncertainties such as payload variations, push disturbances, and obstacles.

### [M3DSS: A Multi-Platform, Multi-Sensor, and Multi-Scenario Dataset for SLAM System]()

This paper proposed M3DSS, a multi-platform, multi-sensor, and multi-scenario dataset for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Fifty-five sequences were collected from multiple platforms, including a handheld equipment, an unmanned ground vehicle, a quadruped robot, a car, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Sensors used in M3DSS included two pairs of stereo event cameras with resolutions of 640×480 and 346×260, one infrared camera, four RGB cameras, two visual-inertial sensors, four mechanical and one solid-state LiDARs, three inertial measurement units, two global navigation satellite and inertial navigation systems with real-time kinematic signals. 21 various sensors were used on 5 different platforms under various challenging scenarios, including extreme illumination, aggressive motion, low-texture, high-speed driving scenarios, etc. To the best of our knowledge, M3DSS offered the richest event-based sensory information for SLAM up to date. We comprehensively evaluated state-of-the-art SLAM approaches and identified their limitations on M3DSS. Details could be found at https://neufs-ma.github.io/M3DSS.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Visual-Inertial SLAM with Volumetric Occupancy Mapping]()

We propose visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping that tightly couples sparse reprojection errors, inertial measurement unit pre-integrals, and relative pose factors with dense volumetric occupancy mapping. Hereby depth predictions from a deep neural network are fused in a fully probabilistic manner. Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.

### [Real-Time 3D Reconstruction Via Camera-LIDAR (2D) Fusion for Mobile Robots: A Gaussian Splatting Approach]()

We present a novel 3D reconstruction-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) approach for robots that leverage multimodal sensory input data, including a camera and a 2D lidar. By integrating these inputs with the gaussian splatting technique, our method significantly enhances performance over traditional SLAM approaches. Traditional SLAM techniques often struggle with the limitations of monocular vision and fail to accurately map and locate objects in dynamic and cluttered environments. Purely relying on camera to localize the robot and map creation is challenging in the presence of dynamic obstacles in the scene. To address this, we proposed a multimodal sensor fusion based 3D reconstruction. Our approach employs lidar-based localization to achieve precise positioning of both the camera and the robot, while utilizing the gaussian splatting technique for robust environmental mapping and 3D reconstruction. This approach is robust to dynamic obstacles in the scene. We have conducted extensive experiments in various real-world and simulated environments, demonstrating that our method not only outperforms traditional monocular SLAM approaches but also achieves higher accuracy in terms of localization and constructed map. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in 3D reconstruction for mobile robots, achieving reduced computational load, higher FPS and enhanced scaling accuracy

### [DVN-SLAM: Dynamic Visual Neural SLAM Based on Local-Global Encoding]()

Recent research on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on implicit representation has shown promising results in indoor environments. However, some challenges remain: the limited scene representation capability of implicit encoding, the uncertainty in the rendering process from implicit representations, and the disruption of consistency by dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic visual SLAM system based on local-global fusion neural implicit representation, named DVN-SLAM. To improve the scene representation capability, we introduce a local-global fusion neural implicit representation that enables the construction of an implicit map while considering both global structure and local details. To tackle uncertainties arising from the rendering process, we design an information concentration loss for optimization, aiming to concentrate scene information on object surfaces. The proposed DVN-SLAM achieves competitive performance in localization and mapping across multiple datasets. More importantly, DVN-SLAM demonstrates robustness without semantic and optical flow prior in dynamic scenes, which sets it apart from other NeRF-based methods.

### [Dy3DGS-SLAM: Monocular 3DGS-SLAM System for Dynamic Environments]()

The current SLAM methods based on NeRF or 3DGS have shown impressive results in reconstructing ideal static 3D scenes. However, they perform poorly in tracking and reconstruction when facing more challenging dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes involving dynamic elements. Although some NeRF-based SLAM methods have attempted to address these dynamic challenges, they rely on RGB-D inputs, and there is a lack of methods that work with pure RGB input. To address these challenges, we introduce Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. For tracking, our method first acquires dynamic object masks through an optical flow estimation system, then combines them with a monocular depth estimation system to obtain merged masks and recover scale. This allows us to remove dynamic objects from non-predefined scenes, enabling dense frame-to-frame mapping. For rendering, we prune the Gaussians generated by pixels with dynamic masks, while applying a scale regularizer to avoid Gaussian artifacts. We impose additional photometric, geometric, and uncertainty losses on the proxy depth to improve rendering accuracy. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) tracking and rendering results in dynamic environments, while also being competitive with or outperforming RGB-D methods.

### [SGBA: Semantic Gaussian Mixture Model-Based LiDAR Bundle Adjustment]()

LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) is an effective approach to reduce the drifts in pose estimation from the front-end. Existing works on LiDAR BA usually rely on predefined geometric features for landmark representation. This reliance restricts generalizability, as the system will inevitably deteriorate in environments where these specific features are absent. To address this issue, we propose SGBA, a LiDAR BAscheme that models the environment as a semantic Gaussian mixture model(GMM) without predefined feature types. This approach encodes both geometric and semantic information, offering a comprehensive and general representation adaptable to various environments. Additionally,to limit computational complexity while ensuring generalizability, we propose an adaptive semantic selection framework that selects the most informative semantic clusters for optimization by evaluating the condition number of the cost function. Lastly, we introduce a probabilistic feature association scheme that considers the entire probability density of assignments, which can manage uncertainties in measurement and initial pose estimation. We have conducted various experiments and the results demonstrate that SGBA can achieve accurate and robust pose refinement even in challenging scenarios with low-quality initial pose estimation and limited geometric features. We plan to open source the work for the benefit of the community @ https://github.com/Ji1Xinyu/SGBA.

### [GeoRecon: Geometric Coherence for Online 3D Scene Reconstruction from Monocular Video]()

Online 3D scene reconstruction from monocular video aims to incrementally recover 3D mesh from monocular RGB videos.It enables robots to accomplish tasks involving interactions with the environment.Due to the high memory consumption of 3D data,almost all existing methods adopt the coarse-to-fine architecture,in which the voxel is progressively sparsified and split across levels.However,these methods overlook alignment between different levels,resulting in poor geometric properties of reconstructed scene.Furthermore,the whole framework relies on voxel features for supervision, lacking effective supervision of the image geometric features extracted by the feature extraction network.These geometric features are essential for further 3D scene reconstruction. To tackle the above problems,we propose GeoRecon,which achieves geometric coherent reconstruction through keyframe 2D representation self-regression and cross-level 3D voxel fea- ture alignment.Specifically,for 2D image space,to alleviate the lack of supervision in 2D feature extraction,an image recon- struction self-supervision regression constraint is introduced on the input 2D keyframes to ensure that the extracted features can learn accurate geometric features and further voxel features. For 3D voxel features space,to achieve consistent alignment between different levels,the high-level voxel features are used to constrain low-level voxel features,and achieve alignment from coarse (i.e.,low-level)voxel features to fine (i.e.,high-level)voxel features.With the design of these two components,the proposed method effectively reconstructs the geometric structures of the scene.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [AstroLoc2: Fast Sequential Depth-Enhanced Localization for Free-Flying Robots]()

We present AstroLoc2, a monocular and time-of-flight (ToF) visual-inertial graph-based localizer used by the Astrobee free-flying robots on the International Space Station (ISS). AstroLoc2 sequentially performs odometry and absolute localization in a single process to decouple map noise from velocity and IMU bias estimation and run efficiently on resource constrained platforms. It improves monocular visual-inertial odometry robustness by adding ToF correspondence factors and uses adaptive map-matching to increase image registration reliability in dynamic environments while preserving fast matching in static ones. We evaluate the performance of AstroLoc2 on a public dataset of 10 ISS activities and show that it improves localization accuracy by 16% and success rates by 5.5% while maintaining a faster runtime than leading methods. AstroLoc2 has enabled the Astrobee robots to perform higher precision maneuvers in changing environments on the ISS. It can be configured for other limited computation platforms and we release the source code to the public.

### [Mixing Data-Driven and Geometric Models for Satellite Docking Port State Estimation Using an RGB or Event Camera]()

In-orbit automated servicing is a promising path towards lowering the cost of satellite operations and reducing the amount of orbital debris. For this purpose, we present a pipeline for automated satellite docking port detection and state estimation using monocular vision data from standard RGB sensing or an event camera. Rather than taking snapshots of the environment, an event camera has independent pixels that asynchronously respond to light changes, offering advantages such as high dynamic range, low power consumption and latency. This work focuses on satellite-agnostic operations (only a geometric knowledge of the actual port is required) using the recently released Lockheed Martin Mission Augmentation Port (LM-MAP) as the target. By leveraging shallow data-driven techniques to preprocess the incoming data to highlight the LM-MAP's reflective navigational aids and then using basic geometric models for state estimation, we present a lightweight and data-efficient pipeline that can be used independently with either RGB or event cameras. We demonstrate the soundness of the pipeline and perform a quantitative comparison of the two modalities based on data collected with a photometrically accurate test bench that includes a robotic arm to simulate the target satellite's uncontrolled motion. The data has been made publicly available: https://uts-ri.github.io/rgb_event_docking_port/

### [A Visual Servo System for Robotic On-Orbit Servicing Based on 3D Perception of Non-Cooperative Satellite]()

The 3D perception of satellites, including both their shape and pose, is a key foundation for robotic on-orbit servicing. However, the demanding space environment—such as intense and dim illumination—presents significant challenges. Previous non-cooperative methods focus on specific geometric features like solar panel brackets or docking rings, overlooking the satellite's overall shape and increasing the risk of collisions during grasping. Additionally, satellites are often weakly textured, limiting the accuracy of 3D perception. To address these issues, we propose, for the first time, a 3D perception-based visual servo system of non-cooperative satellites. This system combines reconstruction and tracking to enhance shape perception and pose estimation accuracy in orbital conditions. Specifically, we employ an alternating iterative strategy to simultaneously reconstruct and track the satellite and introduce a novel constraint to fuse different cues under extreme conditions. Further, we develop a simulation environment platform, a dual-arm microgravity grasping system, and an online monitoring module to enhance system capabilities for on-orbit servicing. Synthetic and real-world datasets from the simulation environment are also created for experimental validation. Results show that each module of our system achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [A Control Strategy for an Orbital Manipulator Equipped with an External Actuator at the End-Effector]()

This paper exploits the robotic capabilities of an orbital manipulator equipped with an actuation module at its end-effector to perform close-proximity robotic operations. The proposed control strategy enables repositioning the system’s center-of-mass by reconfiguring the manipulator configuration and using the end-effector-mounted thrusting mechanism to achieve displacement. The key advantage of the proposed method is that the plume impingement due to thruster firing of the servicer satellite in close-proximity operations towards the client is mitigated. This is achieved by regulating the internal motion of the manipulator such that the thrust firing does not occur near the space asset. The effectiveness of the controller is verified through a multibody dynamic simulation of an orbital manipulator.

### [Robotic Space Simulator: Controls Implementation for Auxiliary Axes and Zero-G Dynamics]()

The Robotic Space Simulator was developed as a physical simulation for in-space manipulation tasks. It incorporates external inputs to its dynamics simulation via force/torque sensors mounted to the 2 6-DoF Stewart platforms which compose its primary structure. Each platform is augmented with an additional degree of freedom in the form of an auxiliary axis - one in translation and one in rotation. Previous work has not effectively included the additional workspace provided by these auxiliary axes. Additionally, it limited the use of external force/torque inputs to the case of platform translation only because the external forces/torques due to platform motion and gravitational force were not removed from the sensor inputs prior to inclusion in the dynamic simulation. In this work, we address each of these limitations. We develop and test two methods of auxiliary axis control: Cartesian Workspace and Joint Cost-Function, and find that both methods are an improvement over the existing system. Additionally we develop and test a method for calculating the mass properties of hardware mounted to the force/torque sensors and a dynamics compensation method for this hardware. Using this technique we are able to effectively compensate for gravitational force in different platform orientations, and achieve zero-g behavior of the system.

### [Dynamics, Simulation & Control of Orbital Modules for On-Orbit Assembly]()

In the context of in-orbit assembly, modular building blocks offer the advantage of distributed launches. After the orbit injection, the overall motion control requires the individual modules to approach each other while regulating their relative shape and total formation. This kind of formation control has already been addressed for rigid body modules. However, in practical cases, each module might be a multibody (with rotors) system. To address the control problem for such a fleet of fixed-inertia multibody modules, we propose a novel dynamics formulation that is inertia-decoupled, singularity-free, and invariant of their absolute poses. We extend the passive decomposition theory for deriving new representative systems corresponding to the total momentum (locked) and relative shape variations. We exploit the dynamics to design two distinct control laws with complementary mission benefits to regulate the locked and relative motions. We also leverage the proposed formulation to design a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) framework, in which the facility reproduced the relative motions while total momentum was propagated in software. Furthermore, the proposed HIL framework and the motion control are experimentally validated.

This article presents the system architecture and the orbital demonstration results of the Int-Ball2, a free-flying camera robot developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The purpose of the Int-Ball2 project is to assist astronauts and reduce their workload in the International Space Station (ISS). This robot is an upgrade from the first Int-Ball, enhancing the propulsion subsystem for greater maneuverability and adding a new docking station (DS) for autonomous battery recharging. This study performed comprehensive ground tests for autonomous maneuvering and docking, employing a combination of a fully software-based simulator,a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator, and a planar air-bearing facility. After a successful launch to the ISS, the Int-Ball2 demonstrated its ability to work in microgravity without relying on astronaut support. The results obtained from ground and orbital tests underscored the effectiveness of our system design and ground verification approach. Further, we present key technologies essential for the Int-Ball2's successful implementation on board the ISS. We expect the insights from this project to be invaluable to future missions involving free-flying robots in microgravity.

### [Harnessing Flagella Dynamics for Enhanced Robot Locomotion at Low Reynolds Number]()

Navigating environments with low Reynolds numbers (Re), where viscous forces dominate, presents unique challenges, such as the need for non-reciprocal motion dynamics. Microorganisms like algae and bacteria, with their specialized structures such as asymmetrical and flexible cilia and flagella, inspire efficient propulsion in such media. However, the mechanism for enhancing the propulsion speed of these microorganisms remains not fully understood. This study introduces a quadriflagellated, algae-inspired, cable-driven robot that mirrors these biological locomotion mechanisms. A single DC motor actuates four multi-segmented flagella, modulating their stiffness throughout the propulsion cycle. We focus on enhancing propulsion speed, hypothesizing that strategic flexibility alterations in flagella—increased during the backward stroke and decreased during the forward stroke—significantly improve propulsion speed. Our experimental results confirm this, showing a marked improvement in propulsion speed, achieving a rate of 0.7+-0.11 cm/cycle. Additionally, we explore the impact of flagella length and number on propulsion, providing valuable insights for biomedical and microfluidic research applications.

### [Development of Multi-Joint Biohybrid Soft Robot by Using Skeletal Muscle Tissue]()

Various forms of biohybrid robots have been developed; however, creating robots with multiple degrees of freedom remains a challenging task. In this paper, we developed a multi-joint biohybrid robot by using skeletal muscle tissue. To achieve this, we first developed a modular bio-actuator actuated by skeletal muscle tissues. The objective of this study was to enhance the contraction force of the actuator and establish optimal experimental conditions for creating high-performance robots. By applying continuous electrical stimulation for five days during culture of bio-actuator, we were able to increase the contraction force by more than threefold. Additionally, we determined the appropriate electric field based on the electrode distance, which enabled us to establish an optimal experimental setup. We also confirmed that connecting the actuators in series can significantly increase the moving distance. Connecting two actuators in series resulted in a total movement distance equivalent to the sum of the distances of each actuator. This finding suggests the potential to create robots with a larger operational workspace. Using these actuators, we first constructed a manipulator with a rotational joint. This research is expected to contribute not only to the development of various robots utilizing bio-actuators but also to advancements in biology technology.

### [A Novel Underwater Robot with Carangiform Locomotion Achieved Via Single Degree of Actuation and Magnetically Transmitted Traveling Wave]()

The phenomenon of the “traveling wave,” commonly observed in various organisms, involves a wave that propagates along the body, serving as a locomotion mechanism. Particularly, in aquatic environments, organisms such as fish and cetaceans utilize traveling waves to propel themselves through water, minimizing fluid drag and maximizing movement efficiency. Inspired by nature, robotics has extensively explored replicating such locomotion strategies. This work presents a fish robot with an innovative magnetic transmission system. The mechanism transforms the unidirectional rotation of a single motor into an oscillatory, phase-shifted movement across the modules of the kinematic chain, generating a traveling wave along the body. The robot’s design and functionality are detailed, highlighting advancements in bio-inspired robotics for underwater applications, such as efficient and non-invasive monitoring and exploration of marine ecosystems. The fish robot achieved a swimming speed of approximately 2 body lengths per second (BL/s) with a tail-beat frequency of 3.24 Hz and a minimum Cost of Transport (CoT) of 5.33 J/(kg·m). Biomimetic robotics can play a key role in sustainable aquafarming, biodiversity conservation, and animal-robot interaction research, offering the potential to minimize ecosystem disruption and advance marine science.

### [AquaMILR: Mechanical Intelligence Simplifies Control of Undulatory Robots in Cluttered Fluid Environments]()

While undulatory swimming of elongate limbless robots has been extensively studied in open hydrodynamic environments, less research has been focused on limbless locomotion in complex, cluttered aquatic environments. Motivated by the concept of mechanical intelligence, where controls for obstacle navigation can be offloaded to passive body mechanics in terrestrial limbless locomotion, we hypothesize that principles of mechanical intelligence can be extended to cluttered hydrodynamic regimes. To test this, we developed an untethered limbless robot capable of undulatory swimming on water surfaces, utilizing a bilateral cable-driven mechanism inspired by organismal muscle actuation morphology to achieve programmable anisotropic body compliance. We demonstrated through robophysical experiments that, similar to terrestrial locomotion, an appropriate level of body compliance can facilitate emergent swim through complex hydrodynamic environments under pure open-loop control. Moreover, we found that swimming performance depends on undulation frequency, with effective locomotion achieved only within a specific frequency range. This contrasts with highly damped terrestrial regimes, where inertial effects can often be neglected. Further, to enhance performance and address the challenges posed by nondeterministic obstacle distributions, we incorporated computational intelligence by developing a real-time body compliance tuning controller based on cable tension feedback. This controller improves the robot's robustness and overall speed in heterogeneous hydrodynamic environments.

### [Ambient Flow Perception of Freely Swimming Robotic Fish Using an Artificial Lateral Line System]()

Robotic fish hold significant promise as efficient underwater systems, yet their inability to accurately perceive ambient flow hinders their deployment in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the natural lateral line system(LLS), a flowresponsive organ in fish that plays a crucial role in behaviors such as rheotaxis, this paper introduces the first Artificial Lateral Line System (ALLS)-based ambient flow classifier for robotic fish that allows robotic fish to perceive flow fields while swimming freely. To be specific, using just 5 pressure sensors and 3.5 minutes of swimming data, we trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, achieving a classification accuracy of 81.25% across 8 flow speed categories, ranging from 0.08 m/s to 0.18 m/s. A key innovation of this work is the formulation of ambient flow perception as a classification task, which not only enables the robotic fish to extract meaningful information but also enhances the robustness and generalizability of the perception framework. Extensive experiments further identify critical factors such as affecting the effectiveness of the ambient flow classifier, offering valuable insights for future development.

### [Leader-Follower Formation Enabled by Pressure Sensing in Free-Swimming Undulatory Robotic Fish]()

Fish use their lateral lines to sense flows and pressure gradients, enabling them to detect nearby objects and organisms. Towards replicating this capability, we demonstrated successful leader-follower formation swimming using flow pressure sensing in our undulatory robotic fish (µBot/MUBot). The follower µBot is equipped at its head with bilateral pressure sensors to detect signals excited by both its own and the leader's movements. First, using experiments with static formations between an undulating leader and a stationary follower, we determined the formation that resulted in strong pressure variations measured by the follower. This formation was then selected as the desired formation in free swimming for obtaining an expert policy. Next, a long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that maps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler angles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was trained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). The results show that with merely two bilateral pressure sensors and less than one hour of training data, the follower effectively tracked the leader within distances of up to 200 mm (= 1 body length) while swimming at speeds of 155 mm/s (= 0.8 body lengths/s). This work highlights the potential of fish-inspired robots to effectively navigate fluid environments and achieve formation swimming through the use of flow pressure feedback.

### [Analysis of Kinematics and Propulsion of a Self-Sensing Multi-DoF Undulating Soft Robotic Fish]()

In this paper we explore kinematics ranging from anguilliform to thunniform achieved in a self-sensing multi-degree-of-freedom soft robotic fish and analyze the effect of them on the swimming. First, we examine the characteristics of the bending actuators of the robotic fish. Then, we express the kinematics of the fish as a propagating wave parameterized by three bending amplitudes and a wavelength, which are determined by the flow rates and phase shift of the pumps. We capture various motion patterns generated by different actuator inputs and directly measure the thrust generated by each pattern. We observe that the robotic swimmer can reproduce two different modes of propulsion, that are embodied by two distinct morphological patterns in nature: anguilliform and thunniform. When neither of modes are activated, propulsion is zero or even negative. Finally, we estimate the stationary swimming speed by towing the undulating fish, which satisfies the slip condition (with the speed of the body wave matching the swimming velocity). The analysis of a wide range of kinematic patterns in this study, including two extreme cases of anguilliform and thunniform modes, will provide insights for comprehensive understanding the mechanics of efficient swimming.

### [Model Predictive Parkour Control of a Monoped Hopper in Dynamically Changing Environments]()

A great advantage of legged robots is their ability to operate on particularly difficult and obstructed terrain, which demands dynamic, robust, and precise movements. The study of obstacle courses provides invaluable insights into the challenges legged robots face, offering a controlled environment to assess and enhance their capabilities. Traversing it with a one-legged hopper introduces intricate challenges, such as planning over contacts and dealing with flight phases, which necessitates a sophisticated controller. A novel model predictive parkour controller is introduced, that finds an optimal path through a real-time changing obstacle course with mixed integer motion planning. The execution of this optimized path is then achieved through a state machine employing a PD control scheme with feedforward torques, ensuring robust and accurate performance.

### [Humanoid Walking Stabilization Via Model Predictive Control with Step Adjustment Based on the 3D Divergent Component of Motion]()

In this paper, as an approach to stabilize humanoid walking where the height of CoM varies, a Novel Model Predictive Control framework based on three dimensional Divergent Component of Motion (3D-DCM) is proposed. To ensure the feasible utilization of contact forces for maintaining humanoid balance, constraints on the control inputs, Virtual Repellent Point (VRP) and footstep adjustment, and their correlation are analytically formulated into a quadratic form, resulting a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming. Additionally, to enable the humanoid robot to withstand disturbances over a broader range of strides or safely navigates various terrains without encountering knee stretch, the distance between the CoM and the foot is constrained in the 3D-CoM trajectory planner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and real-robot experiments in scenarios involving external disturbances and step down motions.

### [MPC-QP-Based Control Framework for Compliant Behavior of Humanoid Robots in Physical Collaboration with Humans]()

We present a control framework specifically for physical human-humanoid collaboration involving the transportation and manipulation of heavy objects. Using this framework, the humanoid can exhibit desired levels of compliance with the object to be co-transported. This desired compliance is achieved through an admittance model. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem, based on a novel Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP) model, generates footstep patterns that facilitate this desired compliant behavior while keeping the robot stable. Subsequently, we have an object-informed low-level quadratic program (QP) that sends control input to realize the high-level plans on the robot. The stiffness parameters of the I-LIP are modulated in real time for better compliance tracking performance of the robot. We verify all the results through simulation on the humanoid platform, the Digit, showing the prowess of the framework in collaboratively transporting heavy objects with a human.

### [Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path Integral Control]()

This paper presents a system for enabling real-time synthesis of whole-body locomotion and manipulation policies for real-world legged robots. Motivated by recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator on a multi-core CPU to achieve fast sampling over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly effective real-world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains, climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of whole-body sampling-based MPC on real-world legged robot hardware.

### [Wallbounce: Push Wall to Navigate with Contact-Implicit MPC]()

In this work, we introduce a framework that enables highly maneuverable locomotion using non-periodic contacts. This task is challenging for traditional optimization and planning methods to handle due to difficulties in specifying contact mode sequences in real-time. To address this, we use a bi-level contact-implicit planner and hybrid model predictive controller to draft and execute a motion plan. We investigate how this method allows us to plan arm contact events on the shmoobot, a smaller ballbot, which uses an inverse mouse-ball drive to achieve dynamic balancing with a low number of actuators. Through multiple experiments we show how the arms allow for acceleration, deceleration and dynamic obstacle avoidance that are not achievable with the mouse-ball drive alone. This demonstrates how a holistic approach to locomotion can increase the control authority of unique robot morpohologies without additional hardware by leveraging robot arms that are typically used only for manipulation.

### [Reduced-Order Model Guided Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control for Humanoid Locomotion]()

Humanoid robots have great potential for real-world applications due to their ability to operate in environments built for humans, but their deployment is hindered by the challenge of controlling their underlying high-dimensional nonlinear hybrid dynamics. While reduced-order models like the Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum (HLIP) are simple and computationally efficient, they lose whole-body expressiveness. Meanwhile, recent advances in Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control (CI-MPC) enable robots to plan through multiple hybrid contact modes, but remain vulnerable to local minima and require significant tuning. We propose a control framework that combines the strengths of HLIP and CI-MPC. The reduced-order model generates a nominal gait, while CI-MPC manages the whole-body dynamics and modifies the contact schedule as needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulation with a novel 24 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot: Achilles. Our proposed framework achieves rough terrain walking, disturbance recovery, robustness under model and state uncertainty, and allows the robot to interact with obstacles in the environment, all while running online in real-time at 50 Hz.

### [CAFE-MPC: A Cascaded-Fidelity Model Predictive Control Framework with Tuning-Free Whole-Body Control]()

This work introduces an optimization-based locomotion control framework for on-the-fly synthesis of complex dynamic maneuvers. At the core of the proposed framework is a cascaded-fidelity model predictive controller (CAFE-MPC). CAFE-MPC strategically relaxes the planning problem along the prediction horizon (i.e., with descending model fidelity, increasingly coarse time steps, and relaxed constraints) for computational and performance gains. This problem is numerically solved with an efficient customized multiple-shooting iLQR (MS-iLQR) solver. The action-value function from CAFE-MPC is then used as the basis for a new value-function-based whole-body control (VWBC) technique that avoids additional tuning for the WBC. We show that CAFE-MPC if configured appropriately, advances the performance of whole-body MPC without necessarily increasing computational cost. Further, we show the superior performance of the proposed VWBC over the Ricatti feedback controller in terms of constraint handling. The proposed framework enables accomplishing for the first time gymnastic-style running barrel roll on the MIT Mini Cheetah.

### [Accurate Robotic Pushing Manipulation through Online Model Estimation under Uncertain Object Properties]()

Robotic pushing is a fundamental non-prehensile manipulation skill essential for handling objects that are difficult to grasp. This letter proposes a highly accurate robotic pushing framework that utilizes an online estimated model to push objects along a given nominal trajectory, despite uncertain object properties such as friction coefficients, mass distribution, and the position of the center of friction (CoF). The core concept involves estimating an optimal pushing motion model capable of representing observed local motions. A generalized form of the conventional analytical model, coupled with a moving-window Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), serves as the online estimated model. It captures the local behavior of the pushed objects and is integrated with a model predictive control-based pushing strategy to achieve precise pushing performance. In experiments, the proposed robotic pushing framework demonstrated superior accuracy in tracking the given nominal trajectory compared to the conventional analytical model and data-driven model approaches, even when the motion model was perturbed. Additionally, the practicality of the proposed framework was showcased through a demonstration involving an autonomous robot collecting dishes, illustrating its applicability in various real-world applications.

### [Exploring the Domain-Invariant Flow Representation in Vision-Based Tactile Sensors for Omni-Hardness Perception]()

Vision-based tactile sensors have recently gained prominence due to their superior resolution and ability to capture multi-dimensional contact information. However, even when sensors share the same sensing principle, variations in production factors can lead to differences in the color patterns of tactile signals. Unlike common vision tasks, vision-based tactile perception depends on tracking light variation in colorful signals, making it more susceptible to lighting conditions and thus more prone to domain gaps. In this paper, we propose an Omni-hardness perception framework that enables adaptation across various vision-based tactile sensors. Firstly, in-depth analyses of the factors influencing the generalization of hardness perception are presented. Furthermore, the light balance module and the force scale module are coupled to regulate network learning of generalized representations. Experimental results across multiple sensors demonstrate the transferability of learned representations. Additionally, downstream tasks in natural object perception, tumor detection, and grasping stability prediction, are proposed to evaluate the potential applications. The framework’s performance shows promise for advancing general tactile sensing and embodied tactile perception.

### [Focused Blind Switching Manipulation Based on Constrained and Regional Touch States of Multi-Fingered Hand Using Deep Learning]()

To achieve a desired grasping posture (including object position and orientation), multi-finger motions need to be conducted according to the the current touch state. Specifically, when subtle changes happen during correcting the object state, not only proprioception but also tactile information from the entire hand can be beneficial. However, switching motions with high-DOFs of multiple fingers and abundant tactile information is still challenging. In this study, we propose a loss function with constraints of touch states and an attention mechanism for focusing on important modalities depending on the touch states. The policy model is AE-LSTM which consists of Autoencoder (AE) which compresses abundant tactile information and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which switches the motion depending on the touch states. Motion for cap-opening was chosen as a target task which consists of subtasks of sliding an object and opening its cap. As a result, the proposed method achieved the best success rates with a variety of objects for real time cap-opening manipulation. Furthermore, we could confirm that the proposed model acquired the features of each subtask and attention on specific modalities.

### [A Magnetic-Actuated Vision-Based Whisker Array for Contact Perception and Grasping]()

Tactile sensing and the manipulation of delicate objects are critical challenges in robotics. This study presents a vision-based magnetic-actuated whisker array sensor that integrates these functions. The sensor features eight whiskers arranged circularly, supported by an elastomer membrane and actuated by electromagnets and permanent magnets. A camera tracks whisker movements, enabling high-resolution tactile feedback. The sensor's performance was evaluated through object classification and grasping experiments. In the classification experiment, the sensor approached objects from four directions and accurately identified five distinct objects with a classification accuracy of 99.17% using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model. In the grasping experiment, the sensor tested configurations of eight, four, and two whiskers, achieving the highest success rate of 87% with eight whiskers. These results highlight the sensor's potential for precise tactile sensing and reliable manipulation.

### [GAPartManip: A Large-Scale Part-Centric Dataset for Material-Agnostic Articulated Object Manipulation]()

Effectively manipulating articulated objects in household scenarios is a crucial step toward achieving general embodied artificial intelligence. Mainstream research in 3D vision has primarily focused on manipulation through depth perception and pose detection. However, in real-world environments, these methods often face challenges due to imperfect depth perception, such as with transparent lids and reflective handles. Moreover, they generally lack the diversity in part-based interactions required for flexible and adaptable manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduced a large-scale part-centric dataset for articulated object manipulation that features both photo-realistic material randomizations and detailed annotations of part-oriented, scene-level actionable interaction poses. We evaluated the effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both simulation and real-world scenarios. More information and demos can be found at: https://pku-epic.github.io/GAPartManip/.

### [High-Precision Object Pose Estimation Using Visual-Tactile Information for Dynamic Interactions in Robotic Grasping]()

In various robotic applications, understanding accurate object poses for robots is essential for high-precision tasks such as factory assembly or daily insertions. Tactile sensing, which compensates for visual information, offers rich texture-based or force-based data for object pose estimation. However, previous methods for pose estimation typically overlook dynamic situations, such as slippage of grasped objects or movement of contacted objects during interactions with the environment, thus increasing the complexity of pose estimation. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method that utilizes visual and tactile sensing to estimate object poses through particle filtering. We leverage visual information to track the pose of the contacted object in real-time and estimate the pose changes of the grasped object using displacement data obtained from tactile sensors. Our experimental evaluation on 13 objects with diverse geometric shapes demonstrated the ability to estimate high-precision poses, which revealed the robot's powerful ability to cope with dynamic scenes for compelled motion of objects, proving our framework's adaptability in practical scenarios with uncertainty.

### [Object-Aware Impedance Control for Human-Robot Collaborative Task with Online Object Parameter Estimation (I)]()

Physical human-robot interactions (pHRIs) can improve robot autonomy and reduce physical demands on humans. In this paper, we consider a collaborative task with a considerably long object and no prior knowledge of the object's parameters. An integrated control framework with an online object parameter estimator and a Cartesian object-aware impedance controller is proposed to realize complicated scenarios. During the transportation task, the object parameters are estimated online while a robot and human keep lifting an object. The perturbation motion is incorporated into the null space of the desired trajectory to enhance the estimator precision. An object-aware impedance controller is designed by incorporating the real-time estimation results to effectively transmit the intended human motion to the robot through the object. Experimental demonstrations of collaborative tasks, including object transportation and assembly, are implemented to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed controller was also compared to a conventional impedance controller through subjective testing and found to be more sensitive, requiring less human effort.

### [SARO: Space-Aware Robot System for Terrain Crossing Via Vision-Language Model]()

The application of vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved impressive success in various robotics tasks. However, there are few explorations for foundation models used in quadruped robot navigation through terrains in 3D environments. We introduce SARO (Space-Aware Robot System for Terrain Crossing), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning module, a closed-loop sub-task execution module, and a low-level control policy. It enables the robot to navigate across 3D terrains and reach the goal position. For high-level reasoning and execution, we propose a novel algorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task decomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level locomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method to effectively train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous experiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate across several 3D terrains, and its generalization ability ensures the applications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains. Appendix and Videos can be found in project page: https://saro-vlm.github.io/

### [Lab2Car: A Versatile Wrapper for Deploying Experimental Planners in Complex Real-World Environments]()

Human-level autonomous driving is an ever-elusive goal, with planning and decision making -- the cognitive functions that determine driving behavior -- posing the greatest challenge. Despite a proliferation of promising approaches, progress is stifled by the difficulty of deploying experimental planners in naturalistic settings. In this work, we propose Lab2Car, an optimization-based wrapper that can take a trajectory sketch from an arbitrary motion planner and convert it to a safe, comfortable, dynamically feasible trajectory that the car can follow. This allows motion planners that do not provide such guarantees to be safely tested and optimized in real-world environments. We demonstrate the versatility of Lab2Car by using it to deploy a machine learning (ML) planner and a classical planner on self-driving cars in Las Vegas. The resulting systems handle challenging scenarios, such as cut-ins, overtaking, and yielding, in complex urban environments like casino pick-up/drop-off areas. Our work paves the way for quickly deploying and evaluating candidate motion planners in realistic settings, ensuring rapid iteration and accelerating progress towards human-level autonomy.

### [One Map to Find Them All: Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Mapping for Zero-Shot Multi-Object Navigation]()

The capability to efficiently search for objects in complex environments is fundamental for many real-world robot applications. Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search. We further propose a probabilistic-semantic map update that mitigates common sources of errors in semantic feature extraction and leverage this semantic uncertainty for informed multi-object exploration. We evaluate our method on a set of object navigation tasks in both simulation as well as with a real robot, running in real-time on a Jetson Orin AGX. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both on single and multi-object navigation tasks. Additional videos, code and the multi-object navigation benchmark will be available on https://finnbsch.github.io/OneMap.

### [Exploring Adversarial Obstacle Attacks in Search-Based Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots]()

Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary’s goal is to delay the robot’s timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm’s robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.

### [Topological Mapping for Traversability-Aware Long-Range Navigation in Off-Road Terrain]()

Autonomous robots navigating in off-road terrain like forests open new opportunities for automation. While off-road navigation has been studied, existing work often relies on clearly delineated pathways. We present a method allowing for long-range planning, exploration and low-level control in unknown off-trail forest terrain, using vision and GPS only. We represent outdoor terrain with a topological map, which is a set of panoramic snapshots connected with edges containing traversability information. A novel traversability analysis method is demonstrated, predicting the existence of a safe path towards a target in an image. Navigating between nodes is done using goal-conditioned behavior cloning, leveraging the power of a pretrained vision transformer. An exploration planner is presented, efficiently covering an unknown off-road area with unknown traversability using a frontiers-based approach. The approach is successfully deployed to autonomously explore two 400 m² forest sites unseen during training, in difficult conditions for navigation.

### [GPU-Enabled Parallel Trajectory Optimization Framework for Safe Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles]()

This paper presents a GPU-enabled parallel trajectory optimization framework for model predictive control (MPC) in complex urban environments. It fuses the advantages of sampling-based MPC, which can cope with nonconvex costmaps through random sampling of trajectories, with the advantages of gradient-based MPC, which can generate smooth trajectories. In addition, we leverage a generalized safety-embedded MPC problem definition with a discrete barrier state (DBaS). The proposed framework has three steps: 1) a costmap builder to generate the barrier function map, 2) a seed trajectory generator to choose randomly generated trajectories to send to the optimizers, and 3) a batch trajectory optimizer to optimize each of the seed trajectories and select the best trajectory. Experiments with real-time simulations compare the effectiveness of the proposed framework, sampling-based MPC, and gradient-based MPC, which optimizes a single trajectory. The experiments also compare the application of two different control sequence sampling schemes to the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework performs gradient-based optimization but can plan a better trajectory even in complex environments by providing various initial guesses. We also show that the proposed framework can perform more accurate control actions than sampling-based MPC.

### [A Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Vehicles with Semantic Graph Optimization]()

Planning a safe and feasible trajectory for autonomous vehicles in real-time by fully utilizing perceptual information in complex urban environments is challenging. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory planning method based on graph optimization. It efficiently extracts the multi-modal information of the perception module by constructing a semantic spatio-temporal map through separation processing of static and dynamic obstacles, and then quickly generates feasible trajectories via sparse graph optimization based on a semantic spatio-temporal hypergraph. Extensive experiments have proven that the proposed method can effectively handle complex urban public road scenarios and perform in real time. We will also release our codes to accommodate benchmarking for the research community

### [Sailing through Point Clouds: Safe Navigation Using Point Cloud Based Control Barrier Functions]()

The capability to navigate safely in an unstructured environment is crucial when deploying robotic systems in real-world scenarios. Recently, control barrier function (CBF) based approaches have been highly effective in synthesizing safety-critical controllers. In this work, we propose a novel CBF-based local planner comprised of two components: Vessel and Mariner. The Vessel is a novel scaling factor based CBF formulation that synthesizes CBFs using only point cloud data. The Mariner is a CBF-based preview control framework that is used to mitigate getting stuck in spurious equilibria during navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we first compare the proposed point cloud based CBF formulation with other point cloud based CBF formulations. Then, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach and its integration with global planners using experimental studies on the Unitree B1 and Unitree Go2 quadruped robots in various environments.

### [Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety]()

Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe set constraint recede along the horizon. In this paper we push that idea further. We suggest to exploit parallel computation for solving several MPC problems at the same time. Each problem instantiate the safe set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

### [Dual-AEB: Synergizing Rule-Based and Multimodal Large Language Models for Effective Emergency Braking]()

Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems are a crucial component in ensuring the safety of passengers in autonomous vehicles. Conventional AEB systems primarily rely on closed-set perception modules to recognize traffic conditions and assess collision risks. To enhance the adaptability of AEB systems in open scenarios, we propose Dual-AEB, a system combines an advanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) for comprehensive scene understanding and a conventional rule-based rapid AEB to ensure quick response times. To the best of our knowledge, Dual-AEB is the first method to incorporate MLLMs within AEB systems. Through extensive experimentation, we have validated the effectiveness of our method.

### [Estimating Control Barriers from Offline Data]()

Learning-based methods for constructing control barrier functions (CBFs) are gaining popularity, for enforcing safety in practical robot control under complex dynamics and uncertainty that are hard to model. A major limitation of existing methods is their reliance on extensive sampling over the state space, making it hard to construct CBFs on real robots. In this work we introduce methods for learning neural CBFs through a fixed, sparsely-labeled dataset collected prior to training either the CBFs or the controllers. We propose novel annotation techniques based on out-of-distribution analysis to effectively propagate the information from the limited labeled data to the unlabeled data. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on real-world platforms. With limited amount of offline data, the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance for dynamic obstacle avoidance, with statistically safer and less conservative maneuvers compared to existing methods.

### [Real-Time Safe Bipedal Robot Navigation Using Linear Discrete Control Barrier Functions]()

Safe navigation in real-time is an essential task for humanoid robots in real-world deployment. Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF constraints. We validate our proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate in a clustered environment in real-time.

### [FuzzRisk: Online Collision Risk Estimation for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Depth-Aware Object Detection Via Fuzzy Inference]()

This paper presents a novel monitoring framework that infers the level of collision risk for autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on their object detection performance. The framework takes two sets of predictions from different algorithms and associates their inconsistencies with the collision risk via fuzzy inference. The first set of predictions is obtained by retrieving safety-critical 2.5D objects from a depth map, and the second set comes from the ordinary AV's 3D object detector. We experimentally validate that, based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a depth discrepancy measure, the inconsistencies between the two sets of predictions strongly correlate to the error of the 3D object detector against ground truths. This correlation allows us to construct a fuzzy inference system and map the inconsistency measures to an AV collision risk indicator. In particular, we optimize the fuzzy inference system towards an existing offline metric that matches AV collision rates well. Lastly, we validate our monitor's capability to produce relevant risk estimates with the large-scale nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it can safeguard an AV in closed-loop simulations.

### [Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems Via CBF-Inspired Risk Measurement]()

Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock --- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.

### [SEAL: A Sample-Efficient Adjustment-Learning Method for Table Tennis Robot Serve]()

Table tennis robots have significantly advanced in performance owing to the rapid progress in deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies. However, these advancements often require a large number of training samples. Besides, research focused on the robot serve task remains relatively limited. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a sample-efficient adjustment-learning (SEAL) method for the serve task inspired by human experience in table tennis, which can inherently augment the available training samples without the need for additional sample collection. The adjustment learning does not require complex network structures but demonstrates superior performances. The models trained by adjustment learning have good generalization and robustness, that can adapt to different serve styles and reduce system transfer errors very efficiently. In addition, the random interpolation method during dataset generation stage is introduced, and the effectiveness of simultaneous learning in both joint space and Cartesian space is also demonstrated. For specific serve task, an accuracy of less than 30 mm to any designated position at the first shot is achieved.

### [Inference Based Multi-Object Reactive Search in a Partially Known Environment with Temporal Logic Specifications]()

Efficiently searching for multiple objects in a partially known environment, where only the names and locations of landmarks are available, presents significant challenges. Existing search algorithms in the literature fail to fully utilize prior knowledge to improve search efficiency, and exhibit significantly diminished efficiency when extended to multi- object search. To address these limitations, we propose an inference-based multi-object reactive search framework. This framework utilizes the COMET inference model to reason about co-occurrence values between the target objects and known landmarks, thereby enhancing search efficiency. These co-occurrence values are integrated into a reactive temporal logic motion planning strategy, which allows the robot search for multiple objects with temporal logic constraints specified by LTL and adapt dynamically if the inferred reasoning differs from the actual object arrangement encountered during the search. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed motion planning algorithm. Results demonstrate that the integration of commonsense reasoning with reactive temporal logic planning significantly improves multi-object search efficiency.

### [Planning with Adaptive World Models for Autonomous Driving]()

Motion planning is crucial for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.

### [Subassembly to Full Assembly: Effective Assembly Sequence Planning through Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning]()

This paper proposes an assembly sequence planning framework, named Subassembly to Assembly (S2A). The framework is designed to enable a robotic manipulator to assemble multiple parts in a prespecified structure by leveraging object manipulation actions. The primary technical challenge lies in the exponentially increasing complexity of identifying a feasible assembly sequence as the number of parts grows. To address this, we introduce a graph-based reinforcement learning approach, where a graph attention network is trained using a delayed reward assignment strategy. In this strategy, rewards are assigned only when an assembly action contributes to the successful completion of the assembly task. We validate the framework's performance through physics-based simulations, comparing it against various baselines to emphasize the significance of the proposed reward assignment approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of deploying our framework in a real-world robotic assembly scenario.

### [Fuel-Optimal Operational Speed Planning for Autonomous Trucking on Highways]()

The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, particularly in autonomous trucking on highways, shows great value for enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in the logistics industry. In this work, we define the full-trip speed planning problem for autonomous trucks under delivery time and fuel consumption constraints, referred to as the Operational Speed Planning (OSP) problem. To support and accelerate research on the OSP problem, we have developed a comprehensive dataset using a fleet of over 400 trucks. The dataset contains rich, diverse information covering more than 22 million kilometers of real-world highway driving data. In addition to this static dataset, we have developed a closed-loop simulator that allows for the interactive evaluation of OSP solutions, enabling researchers to test speed planning strategies in a realistic environment. Furthermore, we provide an OSP baseline method based on dynamic programming to optimize speed planning, balancing the delivery time requirements and fuel consumption. Our extensive experiments demonstrate both the accuracy of the simulation and the effectiveness of the OSP baseline in planning optimal speeds, proving its capability to meet time constraints while improving fuel efficiency. The dataset, simulator, and baseline will be made publicly available to foster further research and innovation in this area.

### [Verifiably Following Complex Robot Instructions with Foundation Models]()

When instructing robots, users want to flexibly express constraints, refer to arbitrary landmarks, and verify robot behavior, while robots must disambiguate instructions into specifications and ground instruction referents in the real world. To address this problem, we propose Language Instruction grounding for Motion Planning (LIMP), an approach that enables robots to verifiably follow complex, open-ended instructions in real-world environments without prebuilt semantic maps. LIMP constructs a symbolic instruction representation that reveals the robot’s alignment with an instructor’s intended motives and affords the synthesis of correct-by-construction robot behaviors. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of LIMP on 150 instructions across five real-world environments, demonstrating its versatility and ease of deployment in diverse, unstructured domains. LIMP performs comparably to state-of-the-art baselines on standard open-vocabulary tasks and additionally achieves a 79% success rate on complex spatiotemporal instructions, significantly outperforming baselines that only reach 38%.

### [A Hierarchical Approach for Joint Task Allocation and Path Planning]()

This paper addresses the joint task allocation and path planning problem, whereby a fleet of vehicles must be optimally assigned to service multiple given tasks while their planned paths must be collision-free. Such a problem composed of two tightly coupled optimization problems has a high complexity with the number of tasks and the number of vehicles, thus optimal solvers do not scale to large size instances. Therefore, we propose a novel method to solve this problem, HTAPPS, which introduces a hierarchical resolution framework. Our proposed approach decomposes a given instance into three levels of abstractions and associated amount of details that progressively filter the search space. This allows us to reduce the computational effort required when performing task allocation and multi-agent path planning jointly. We perform simulations on automated warehouse scenarios, and compare our approach to baseline solvers. The obtained results show that our proposed approach is able to solve large size instances within a limited time.

### [Multi S-Graphs: An Efficient Distributed Semantic-Relational Collaborative SLAM]()

Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (CSLAM) is critical to enable multiple robots to operate in complex environments. Most CSLAM techniques rely on raw sensor measurement or low-level features such as keyframe descriptors, which can lead to wrong loop closures dueto the lack of deep understanding of the environment. Moreover, the exchange of these measurements and low-level features among the robots requires the transmission of a significant amount of data, which limitsthe scalability of the system. To overcome these limitations, we present Multi S-Graphs, a decentralized CSLAM system that utilizes high-level semantic-relational information embedded in the four-layeredhierarchical and optimizable situational graphs for cooperative map generation and localization in structured environments while minimizing the information exchanged between the robots. To support this, we present a novel room-based descriptor which, along with its connected walls, is used to perform inter-robot loop closures, addressing the challenges of multi-robot kidnapped problem initialization. Multiple experiments in simulated and real environments validate the improvement in accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach while reducing the amount of data exchanged between robots compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

### [Language-Conditioned Offline RL for Multi-Robot Navigation]()

We present a method for synthesizing navigation policies for multi-robot teams that interpret and follow natural language instructions. We condition these policies on embeddings from pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), and train them via offline reinforcement learning with as little as 20 minutes of randomly-collected real-world data. Experiments on a team of five real robots show that these policies generalize well to unseen commands, indicating an understanding of the LLM latent space. Our method requires no simulators or environment models, and produces low-latency control policies that can be deployed directly to real robots without finetuning. We provide videos of our experiments at https://sites.google.com/view/llm-marl.

### [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Coordinated Payload Transport in Biped-Wheeled Robots]()

Coordinated payload transport via a fleet of modular wheeled mobile robots offers flexibility for handling larger loads in indoor and outdoor environments. Biped-wheeled robots have recently emerged as a viable architecture for an independent/stand-alone wheeled mobile robot. In this work, we explore the use of two biped-wheeled robots that can leverage their mobility and maneuvarability for enhanced spatial pose control and stabilization for various payload transport tasks. However, coordinated control of multiple articulated wheeled robots for path tracking of a payload presents significant (and potentially competing) challenges, including kinematic redundancy, stability concerns, relative motion between the payload and robots, and precise motion control to achieve effective coordination. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework to develop the motion-plans for the system. In particular, this approach generates the ego robot's body twist and the follower robot's relative twist with respect to the ego robot. By formulating the action space of the follower robot as a relative twist, our approach facilitates pairwise interactions between robots. Furthermore, we use only relative pose information and the errors as states for the DRL controller, thereby making it agnostic to initial conditions and avoiding explicit dependency on absolute pose. We validate our approach through simulations conducted in Isaac Sim and on hardware using Diablo biped-wheeled robots with zero-shot transfer, demonstrating effective payload path tracking across varying parameters.

### [Reinforcement Learning within the Classical Robotics Stack: A Case Study in Robot Soccer]()

Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.

### [Residual Descent Differential Dynamic Game (RD3G) -- a Fast Newton Solver for Constrained General Sum Games]()

We present Residual Descent Differential Dynamic Game (RD3G), a Newton-based solver for constrained multi- agent game-control problems. The proposed solver seeks a local Nash equilibrium for games where agents are coupled through their rewards and state constraints. By maintaining a dynamic set of active constraints, combined with a barrier function on satisfied constraints and a backtracking line search, the proposed method is able to satisfy state constraints while keeping the dimension of the Newton descent direction problem to a minimum. We compare the proposed method against state- of-the-art techniques and showcase the computational benefits of the RD3G algorithm on several example problems. The RD3G is up to 4X faster and has 2X higher convergence rate than existing approaches in higher dimensional games.

### [MARLadona - towards Cooperative Team Play Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning]()

Robot soccer, in its full complexity, poses an unsolved research challenge. Current solutions heavily rely on engineered heuristic strategies, which lack robustness and adaptability. Deep reinforcement learning has gained significant traction in various complex robotics tasks such as locomotion, manipulation, and competitive games (e.g., AlphaZero, OpenAI Five), making it a promising solution to the robot soccer problem. This paper introduces MARLadona. A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) training pipeline capable of producing agents with sophisticated team play behavior, bridging the shortcomings of heuristic methods. Furthermore, we created an open-source multi-agent soccer environment. Utilizing our MARL framework and a modified a global entity encoder (GEE) as our core architecture, our approach achieves a 66.8 % win rate against HELIOS agent, which employs a state-of-the-art heuristic strategy. In addition, we provided an in-depth analysis of the policy behavior and interpreted the agent’s intention using the critic network.

### [Multi-Agent Inverse Q-Learning from Demonstrations]()

When reward functions are hand-designed, deep reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from reward misspecification, causing them to learn suboptimal policies. In the single-agent case, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) techniques attempt to address this issue by inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. However, in multi-agent problems, misalignment between the learned and true objectives is exacerbated due to increased environment non-stationarity and variance that scale with multiple agents. As such, in multi-agent general-sum games, multi-agent IRL algorithms have difficulty balancing cooperative and competitive objectives. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Agent Marginal Q-Learning from Demonstrations (MAMQL), a novel sample-efficient framework for multi-agent IRL. For each agent, MAMQL learns a critic marginalized over the other agents' policies, allowing for a well-motivated use of Boltzmann policies in the multi-agent context. We identify a connection between optimal marginalized critics and single-agent soft-Q IRL, allowing us to apply a direct, simple optimization criterion from the single-agent domain. Across our experiments on three different simulated domains, MAMQL significantly outperforms previous multi-agent methods in average reward, sample efficiency, and reward recovery by often more than 2-5x. We make our code available at https://sites.google.com/view/mamql .

### [LoGS: Visual Localization for Mobile Robots with Gaussian Splatting]()

Visual localization involves estimating a query im-age’s 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) camera pose, which is a funda-mental component in various computer vision and robotic tasks. This paper presents LoGS, a vision-based localization pipeline utilizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) technique as scene representation. This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map. Experimental results on four large-scale datasets demonstrate the proposed approach’s SoTA accuracy in estimating camera poses and robustness under challenging few-shot conditions.

### [Unified Human Localization and Trajectory Prediction with Monocular Vision]()

Conventional human trajectory prediction models rely on clean curated data, requiring specialized equipment or manual labeling, which is often impractical for robotic applications. The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird’s Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

### [HGSLoc: 3DGS-Based Heuristic Camera Pose Refinement]()

Visual localization refers to the process of determining camera poses and orientation within a known scene representation. This task is often complicated by factors such as changes in illumination and variations in viewing angles. In this paper, we propose HGSLoc, a novel lightweight plug-and-play pose optimization framework, which integrates 3D reconstruction with a heuristic refinement strategy to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, we introduce an explicit geometric map for 3D representation and high-fidelity rendering, allowing the generation of high-quality synthesized views to support accurate visual localization. Our method demonstrates higher localization accuracy compared to NeRF-based neural rendering localization approaches. We introduce a heuristic refinement strategy, its efficient optimization capability can quickly locate the target node, while we set the step-level optimization step to enhance the pose accuracy in the scenarios with small errors. With carefully designed heuristic functions, it offers efficient optimization capabilities, enabling rapid error reduction in rough localization estimations. Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies. The optimization framework proposed in this paper introduces novel approaches to visual localization by integrating the advantages of 3D reconstruction and the heuristic refinement strategy, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including 7Scenes and Deep Blending dataset. The implementation of our method has been released at https://github.com/anchang699/HGSLoc.

### [Depth Estimation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting Siamese Defocus]()

Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.

### [GSFusion: Online RGB-D Mapping Where Gaussian Splatting Meets TSDF Fusion]()

Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/goldoak/GSFusion.

### [San Francisco World: Leveraging Structural Regularities of Slope for 3-DoF Visual Compass]()

We propose the San Francisco world (SFW) model, a novel structural model inspired by San Francisco's hilly terrain, enabling 3D inter-floor navigation in urban areas rather than being limited to 2D intra-floor navigation of various robotics platforms. Our SFW consists of a single vertical dominant direction (VDD), two horizontal dominant directions (HDDs), and four sloping dominant directions (SDDs) sharing a common inclination angle. Although SFW is a more general model than the Manhattan world (MW), it is a more compact model than the mixture of Manhattan world (MMW). Leveraging the structural regularities of SFW, such as uniform inclination angle and geometric patterns of the four SDDs, we design an efficient and robust DD/vanishing point estimation method by aggregating sloping line normals on the Gaussian sphere. We further utilize the structural patterns of SFW for the 3-DoF visual compass, the rotational motion tracking from a single line and plane, which corresponds to the theoretical minimal sampling for 3-DoF rotation estimation. Our method demonstrates enhanced adaptability in more challenging inter-floor scenes in urban areas and the highest rotational tracking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We release the first dataset of sequential RGB-D images captured in San Francisco world (SFW) and open source codes at: https://SanFranciscoWorld.github.io/.

### [Monocular 360 Depth Estimation Via Spherical Fully-Connected CRFs]()

Monocular 360 depth estimation poses significant challenges due to the inherent distortion of the equirectangular projection (ERP). This distortion separates adjacent spherical points after their projection onto the ERP plane, especially in the polar regions, resulting in insufficient spherical relationships. To address this issue, recent methods calculate spherical neighbors within the tangent domain. However, since the tangent patch and the sphere share only one common point, spherical relationships are established only among neighbors around this common point. In this paper, we propose Spherical Fully-Connected CRFs (SF-CRFs). We start by evenly partitioning an ERP image into regular windows, where windows at the equator have broader spherical neighbors than those at the poles. To enhance spherical relationships, our SF-CRFs feature two key components. Firstly, to include sufficient spherical neighbors, we introduce a Spherical Window Transform (SWT) module. This module replicates the equator window’s spherical relationships across all other windows, leveraging the rotational invariance of the sphere. Remarkably, the transformation process is efficient, transforming all windows in a 512x1024 ERP image in just 0.038 seconds on a CPU. Secondly, we introduce a Planar-Spherical Interaction (PSI) module to calculate the SF-CRFs, which facilitates the relationships between regular and transformed windows. By integrating SF-CRFs blocks into a decoder, we propose CRF360D, a novel 360 depth estimation framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets. Our CRF360D is compatible with different perspective image-trained backbones, serving as the encoder.

### [Bidirectional Energy Flow Modulation for Passive Admittance Control]()

Admittance control is a control scheme to enable physical interactions of a robot, but it easily induces instability when the robot contacts a rigid surface. In this study, passivity analysis was conducted on a robotic system with admittance control. The results showed that coupled stability with the environment can be ensured when the velocity error between the proxy and the real robot is eliminated. Thus, an adaptive structure modification method is proposed to suppress the possible source of instability. In addition, the energy tank method is combined with the proposed method to ensure system passivity. As a proof of concept, three robot experiments were performed, and the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the conventional admittance control and impedance control (with friction compensation). The comparison showed that the proposed method could make the system passive while it realized the desired dynamics during the interaction.

### [A Minimum-Jerk Approach to Handle Singularities in Virtual Fixtures]()

Implementing virtual fixtures in guiding tasks constrains the movement of the robot's end effector to specific curves within its workspace. However, incorporating guiding frameworks may encounter discontinuities when optimizing the reference target position to the nearest point relative to the current robot position. This article aims to give a geometric interpretation of such discontinuities, with specific reference to the commonly adopted Gauss-Newton algorithm. The effect of such discontinuities, defined as Euclidean Distance Singularities, is experimentally proved.We then propose a solution that is based on a linear quadratic tracking problem with minimum jerk command, then compare and validate the performances of the proposed framework in two different human-robot interaction scenarios.

### [Continuous Wrist Control on the Hannes Prosthesis: A Vision-Based Shared Autonomy Framework]()

Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

### [Integrating Learning-Based Manipulation and Physics-Based Locomotion for Whole-Body Badminton Robot Control]()

Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce Hamlet, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed “IL+RL” training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks e.g., agile catching, table tennis. A video demonstrating our system can be viewed at https://youtu.be/8-ixKAD18Mk.

### [Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems]()

Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.

### [Quadratic Programming-Based Reference Spreading Control for Dual-Arm Robotic Manipulation with Planned Simultaneous Impacts]()

With the aim of further enabling the exploitation of intentional impacts in robotic manipulation, a control framework is presented that directly tackles the challenges posed by tracking control of robotic manipulators that are tasked to perform nominally simultaneous impacts. This framework is an extension of the reference spreading (RS) control framework, in which overlapping anteand post-impact references that are consistent with impact dynamics are defined. In this work, such a reference is constructed starting from a teleoperation-based approach. By using the corresponding ante- and post-impact control modes in the scope of a quadratic programming control approach, peaking of the velocity error and control inputs due to impacts is avoided while maintaining high tracking performance. With the inclusion of a novel interim mode, we aim to also avoid input peaks and steps when uncertainty in the environment causes a series of unplanned single impacts to occur rather than the planned simultaneous impact. This work in particular presents for the first time an experimental evaluation of RS control on a robotic setup, showcasing its robustness against uncertainty in the environment compared to three baseline control approaches.

### [HARMONIOUS - Human-Like Reactive Motion Control and Multimodal Perception for Humanoid Robots]()

For safe and effective operation of humanoid robots in human-populated environments, the problem of commanding a large number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) while simultaneously considering dynamic obstacles and human proximity has still not been solved. We present a new reactive motion controller that commands two arms of a humanoid robot and three torso joints (17 DoF in total). We formulate a quadratic program that seeks joint velocity commands respecting multiple constraints while minimizing the magnitude of the velocities. We introduce a new unified treatment of obstacles that dynamically maps visual and proximity (pre-collision) and tactile (post-collision) obstacles as additional constraints to the motion controller, in a distributed fashion over the surface of the upper body of the iCub robot (with 2000 pressure-sensitive receptors). This results in a bio-inspired controller that: (i) gives rise to a robot with whole-body visuo-tactile awareness, resembling peripersonal space representations, and (ii) produces human-like minimum jerk movement profiles. The controller was extensively experimentally validated, including a physical human-robot interaction scenario.

### [FedDet: Data Poisoning Attack Detection for Federated Skeleton-Based Action Recognition]()

Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) models often centralize skeleton data, increasing significant privacy concerns. To address this, decentralized training models for SAR have been advanced, particularly using federated learning (FL), a research area of considerable value with wide-ranging applications, including human-robot interaction, camera-enabled devices, and security surveillance. However, FL-based SAR faces the challenge of substantial accuracy degradation due to data poisoning attacks; thus, it requires the identification of malicious clients. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting data poisoning attacks in federated SAR, called FedDet. The method involves creating prototypes of perspective transform and exchanging these matrices between the clients and server to identify the malicious client. Additionally, a prototype-guided attack detector is developed, incorporating spatiotemporal matching to analyze the correlation between prototype skeleton data. Experimental results on FL frameworks and SAR models demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/alsgur0720/federated-detection.

### [ROS2WASM: Bringing the Robot Operating System to the Web]()

The Robot Operating System (ROS) has become the de facto standard middleware in robotics, widely adopted across domains ranging from education to industrial applications. The RoboStack distribution, a conda-based packaging system for ROS, has extended ROS's accessibility by facilitating installation across all major operating systems and architectures, integrating seamlessly with scientific tools such as PyTorch and Open3D. This paper presents ROS2WASM, a novel integration of RoboStack with WebAssembly, enabling the execution of ROS 2 and its associated software directly within web browsers, without requiring local installations. ROS2WASM significantly enhances the reproducibility and shareability of research, lowers barriers to robotics education, and leverages WebAssembly's robust security framework to protect against malicious code. We detail our methodology for cross-compiling ROS 2 packages into WebAssembly, the development of a specialized middleware for ROS 2 communication within browsers, and the implementation of www.ros2wasm.dev, a web platform enabling users to interact with ROS 2 environments. Additionally, we extend support to the Robotics Toolbox for Python and adapt its Swift simulator for browser compatibility. Our work paves the way for unprecedented accessibility in robotics, offering scalable, secure, and reproducible environments that have the potential to transform educational and research paradigms.

### [Prepared for the Worst: Resilience Analysis of the ICP Algorithm Via Learning-Based Worst-Case Adversarial Attacks]()

This paper presents a novel method for assessing the resilience of the ICP algorithm via learning-based, worst-case attacks on lidar point clouds. For safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, ensuring the resilience of algorithms before deployments is crucial. The ICP algorithm is the standard for lidar-based localization, but its accuracy can be greatly affected by corrupted measurements from various sources, including occlusions, adverse weather, or mechanical sensor issues. Unfortunately, the complex and iterative nature of ICP makes assessing its resilience to corruption challenging. While there have been efforts to create challenging datasets and develop simulations to evaluate the resilience of ICP, our method focuses on finding the maximum possible ICP error that can arise from corrupted measurements at a location. We demonstrate that our perturbation-based adversarial attacks can be used pre-deployment to identify locations on a map where ICP is particularly vulnerable to corruptions in the measurements. With such information, autonomous robots can take safer paths when deployed, to mitigate against their measurements being corrupted. The proposed attack outperforms baselines more than 88% of the time across a wide range of scenarios.

### [SLAMSpoof: Practical LiDAR Spoofing Attacks on Localization Systems Guided by Scan Matching Vulnerability Analysis]()

Accurate localization is essential for enabling modern full self-driving services. These services heavily rely on map-based traffic information to reduce uncertainties in recognizing lane shapes, traffic light locations, and traffic signs. Achieving this level of reliance on map information requires centimeter-level localization accuracy, which is currently only achievable with LiDAR sensors. However, LiDAR is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks that emit malicious lasers against LiDAR to overwrite its measurements. Once localization is compromised, the attack could lead the victim off roads or make them ignore traffic lights. Motivated by these serious safety implications, we design SLAMSpoof, the first practical LiDAR spoofing attack on localization systems for self-driving to assess the actual attack significance on autonomous vehicles. SLAMSpoof can effectively find the effective attack location based on our scan matching vulnerability score (SMVS), a point-wise metric representing the potential vulnerability to spoofing attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the attack, we conduct real-world experiments on ground vehicles and confirm its high capability in real-world scenarios, inducing position errors of ≥4.2 meters (more than typical lane width) for all 3 popular LiDAR-based localization algorithms. We finally discuss the potential countermeasures of this attack. Code is available at https://github.com/Keio-CSG/slamspoof

### [Gradient-Based Adversarial Attacks on Deep LiDAR Odometry]()

Adversarial attacks have been recently investigated in LiDAR perception problems for autonomous driving, where a small perturbation to the source inputs can result in incorrect predictions. However, most prior studies focus on attacks on single-frame perception modules, lacking explorations of attacks on consecutive-frame tasks, i.e. the LiDAR odometry. In this paper, we propose a gradient optimization-based adversarial attack towards deep LiDAR odometry networks. To generate point clouds consistent with real-world scenarios, we constrain adversarial points within the range of a small object, e.g. a traffic cone, and render new points to simulate real LiDAR measurements. By incorporating such adversarial points in consecutive frames, we demonstrate a significant decrease in pose estimation accuracy of current popular LiDAR odometry networks. In addition, we also evaluate traditional geometric odometry approaches and report their robustness over adversarial points. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method and the vulnerability of deep LiDAR odometry methods against adversarial points.

### [Enhancing 3D Robotic Vision Robustness by Minimizing Adversarial Mutual Information through a Curriculum Training Approach]()

Adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries through small, carefully crafted perturbations that lead to significant mispredictions. In 3D vision, the high dimensionality and sparsity of data greatly expand the attack surface, making 3D vision particularly vulnerable for safety-critical robotics. To enhance 3D vision's adversarial robustness, we propose a training objective that simultaneously minimizes prediction loss and mutual information (MI) under adversarial perturbations to contain the upper bound of misprediction errors. This approach simplifies handling adversarial examples compared to conventional methods, which require explicit searching and training on adversarial samples. However, minimizing prediction loss conflicts with minimizing MI, leading to reduced robustness and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we integrate curriculum advisors in the training setup that gradually introduce adversarial objectives to balance training and prevent models from being overwhelmed by difficult cases early in the process. The advisors also enhance robustness by encouraging training on diverse MI examples through entropy regularizers. We evaluated our method on ModelNet40 and KITTI using PointNet, DGCNN, SECOND, and PointTransformers, achieving 2--5% accuracy gains on ModelNet40 and a 5--10% mAP improvement in object detection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nstrndrbi/Mine-N-Learn.

### [PaTS-Wheel: A Passively-Transformable Single-Part Wheel for Mobile Robot Navigation on Unstructured Terrain]()

Most mobile robots use wheels that perform well on even and structured ground, like in factories and warehouses. However, they face challenges traversing unstructured terrain such as stepped obstacles. This paper presents the design and testing of the PaTS-Wheel: a Passively-Transformable Single-part Wheel that can transform to render hooks when presented with obstacles. The passive rendering of this useful morphological feature is guided purely by the geometry of the obstacle. The energy consumption and vibrational profile of the PaTS-Wheel on flat ground is comparable to a standard wheel of the same size. In addition, our novel wheel design (with a diameter of 120 mm) was tested traversing different terrains with stepped obstacles of incremental heights. The PaTS-Wheel achieved 100 % success rate at traversing stepped obstacles 83 mm high (~ 70 % its diameter), higher than the results obtained for an equivalent wheel at 30 mm (~ 25 % its diameter) and an equivalent wheg at 73 mm (~ 61% its diameter). This achieves the design objectives of combining the energy efficiency and ride smoothness of wheels with the obstacle traversal capabilities of legged robots, all without requiring any sensors, actuators, or controllers.

### [Balloon Pin-Array Gripper: Two-Step Shape Adaptation Mechanism for Stable Grasping against Object Misalignment]()

This study introduces a balloon pin-array gripper combining shape adaptability to various objects, stable holding by multipoint contact, and isotropic grasping performance. This is particularly useful when the shape or position of the objects cannot be accurately determined because of sensor limitations. This gripper has multiple pins whose tips are covered by flexible balloons. The gripper can adapt to the shapes of objects in two steps: axial sliding of the pins and radial inflation of the balloons. This study focuses on the effect of the layout of pins on grasping and proposes a simulation model to quantify the characteristics of each layout. Simulations showed that the concentric layout enables stable grasping by ensuring many pins contact the object, regardless of misalignment. Experiments using a prototype gripper demonstrated a trend consistent with the simulation results, proving the validity of the simulation model.

### [Adaptive Perching and Grasping by Aerial Robot with Light-Weight and High Grip-Force Tendon-Driven Three-Fingered Hand Using Single Actuator]()

Aerial robots, especially multirotor type, have been utilized in various scenarios such as inspection, surveillance, and logistics. The most critical issue for multirotor type is the limited flight time due to the large power consumption for hovering against gravity. Inspired by nature, various research focus on the perching and grasping ability by deploying a gripper on the multirotor to grasp arboreal environments for saving energy; however, most the mechanical design for gripper restricts the approach path, which significantly limits the performance of perching and grasping. Besides, it is also challenging to design a light gripper that also offers sufficiently large grip force to hang itself. Therefore, in this work, we develop a single-actuator hand for aerial robot that enables adaptive grasping of various objects, and thus can perch from various approach directions. First, we present the design of the lightweight three-fingered hand with a pair of special two-dimensional differential plates that enables the adaptive grasping with a single actuator. In addition, we develop a unique control method for the over-actuated aerial robot equipped with this hand to perform both adaptive pendulum-like perching and detachment. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the prototype hand via load-bearing test and various object grasping tests, along with the inflight perching experiments.

### [CAFEs: Cable-Driven Collaborative Floating End-Effectors for Agriculture Applications]()

CAFEs (Collaborative Agricultural Floating End-effectors) is a new robot design and control approach to automating large-scale agricultural tasks. Based upon a cable driven robot architecture, by sharing the same roller-driven cable set with modular robotic arms, a fast-switching clamping mechanism allows each CAFE to clamp onto or release from the moving cables, enabling both independent and synchronized movement across the workspace. The methods developed to enable this system include the mechanical design, precise position control and a dynamic model for the spring-mass liked system, ensuring accurate and stable movement of the robotic arms. The system's scalability is further explored by studying the tension and sag in the cables to maintain performance as more robotic arms are deployed. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in tasks including pick-and-place showing its potential to contribute to agricultural automation.

### [A Robotic Finger with a 4-Bar Linkage-Based Compact and Continuously Variable Active Transmission]()

This paper presents a practical design implementation of 4-bar linkage-based compact and continuously variable active transmission (CCVAT) specifically tailored for the form factor of a robotic finger. The proposed CCVAT aims to solve the two major limitations of conventional linkage-based continuously variable transmission: increased inertia and complexities associated with miniaturization. To counter these limitations, our design incorporates a custom flexible shaft within the joint of the robotic finger, enhancing its adaptability and operational efficiency. In addition, we proposed a cascaded control architecture, combining a disturbance-observer-based low-level controller and a mid-level controller responsible for managing both the transmission ratio and flexion angle of the system. Finally, the feasibility of the prototype was evaluated by conducting several experiments.

### [A Dexterous and Compliant (DexCo) Hand Based on Soft Hydraulic Actuation for Human Inspired Fine In-Hand Manipulation]()

Human beings possess a remarkable skill for fine in-hand manipulation, utilizing both intra-finger interactions (in-finger) and finger-environment interactions across a wide range of daily tasks. These tasks range from skilled activities like screwing light bulbs, picking and sorting pills, and in-hand rotation, to more complex tasks such as opening plastic bags, cluttered bin picking, and counting cards. Despite its prevalence in human activities, replicating these fine motor skills in robotics remains a substantial challenge. This study tackles the challenge of fine in-hand manipulation by introducing the dexterous and compliant (DexCo) hand system. The DexCo hand mimics human dexterity, replicating the intricate interaction between the thumb, index, and middle fingers, with a contractable palm. The key to maneuverable fine in-hand manipulation lies in its innovative soft hydraulic actuation, which strikes a balance between control complexity, dexterity, compliance, and motion accuracy within a compact structure, enhancing the overall performance of the system. The model of soft hydraulic actuation, based on hydrostatic force analysis, reveals the compliance of hand joints, whic

### [A Minimally Designed Audio-Animatronic Robot]()

Animatronic robots that simulate lively and realistic motions of creatures can be excellent robotic platforms for social interaction with people. In particular, a robot head is a very important part to express various emotions and generate human-friendly and aesthetic impressions. This article presents Ray, a new type of audio-animatronic robot head. All mechanical structure of the robot is built in one step by 3D printing and has multiple layers expressing the overall shape of a human head and important features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. This simple, lightweight structure and the separate tendon-based actuation system underneath allow for smooth, fast motions of the robot. We also develop an audio-driven motion generation module that automatically synthesizes natural and rhythmic motions of the head and mouth. The developed robot platform is used for various applications for example as a talking robot, robot singer, and robot MC. We expect this research opens up a new paradigm and application possibilities for minimally designed audio-animatronic robots.

### [High Speed Robotic Table Tennis Swinging Using Lightweight Hardware with Model Predictive Control]()

We present a robotic table tennis platform that achieves a variety of hit styles and ball-spins with high precision, power, and consistency. This is enabled by a custom lightweight, high-torque, low rotor inertia, five degree-of-freedom arm capable of high acceleration. To generate swing trajectories, we formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) that constrains the state of the paddle at the time of the strike. The terminal position is given by a predicted ball trajectory, and the terminal orientation and velocity of the paddle are chosen to match various possible styles of hits: loops (topspin), drives (flat), and chops (backspin). Finally, we construct a fixed-horizon model predictive controller (MPC) around this OCP to allow the hardware to quickly react to changes in the predicted ball trajectory. We validate on hardware that the system is capable of hitting balls with an average exit velocity of 11 m/s at an 88% success rate across the three swing types.

### [Learning Quiet Walking for a Small Home Robot]()

As home robotics gains traction, robots are increasingly integrated into households, offering companionship and assistance. Quadruped robots, particularly those resembling dogs, have emerged as popular alternatives for traditional pets. However, user feedback highlights concerns about the noise these robots generate during walking at home, particularly the loud footstep impact sound. To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to minimize the foot contact velocity highly related to the footstep sound. Our framework incorporates three key elements: learning varying PD gains to actively dampen and stiffen each joint, utilizing foot contact sensors, and employing curriculum learning to gradually enforce penalties on foot contact velocity. Experiments demonstrate that our learned policy achieves superior quietness compared to a RL baseline and the carefully handcrafted Sony commercial controller baselines. Furthermore, the trade-off between robustness and quietness is shown. This research contributes to developing quieter and more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments.

Robot manipulation researchers reference human performance as a goal for their work, however, human data is seldom present in robotics benchmarks. We introduce a real-world benchmark targeting manipulation skills for performing electrical circuit inspection with a multimeter using an Internet-connected electronic task board. We present timing study results and an exemplary robot solution across six different tasks from the Robothon Grand Challenge at the automatica conference in 2023. Contributions from 16 robot teams were collected using task boards we manufactured and distributed as part of the 30-day international competition as an initial performance database. Our work systematically highlights the skill gap between the winning robot solution and the best human performance from a group of 30 subjects. Our goal is to chronicle progress over time in robot manipulation skills and provide a standardized, physical benchmark across the global community. Videos of the team submissions, the exemplary robot solution, as well as the project reproduction code are provided in the included repository.

### [RaccoonBot: An Autonomous Wire-Traversing Solar-Tracking Robot for Persistent Environmental Monitoring]()

Environmental monitoring is used to characterize the health and relationship between organisms and their environments. In forest ecosystems, robots can serve as platforms to acquire such data, even in hard-to-reach places where wire-traversing platforms are particularly promising due to their efficient displacement. This paper presents the RaccoonBot, which is a novel autonomous wire-traversing robot for persistent environmental monitoring, featuring a fail-safe mechanical design with a self-locking mechanism in case of electrical shortage. The robot also features energy-aware mobility through a novel Solar tracking algorithm, that allows the robot to find a position on the wire to have direct contact with solar power to increase the energy harvested. Experimental results validate the electro-mechanical features of the RaccoonBot, showing that it is able to handle wire perturbations, different inclinations, and achieving energy autonomy.

### [Fast and Accurate Relative Motion Tracking for Dual Industrial Robots]()

Industrial robotic applications such as spraying, welding, and additive manufacturing frequently require fast, accurate, and uniform motion along a 3D spatial curve. To increase process throughput, some manufacturers propose a dual-arm setup to overcome the speed limitation of a single robot. Industrial robot motion is programmed through waypoints connected by motion primitives (Cartesian linear and circular paths and linear joint paths at constant Cartesian speed). The actual robot motion is affected by the blending between these motion primitives and the pose of the robot (an outstretched/near-singularity pose tends to have larger path-tracking errors). Choosing the waypoints and the speed along each motion segment to achieve the performance requirement is challenging. At present, there is no automated solution, and laborious manual tuning by robot experts is needed to approach the desired performance. In this letter, we present a systematic three-step approach to designing and programming a dual-arm system to optimize system performance. The first step is to select the relative placement between the two robots based on the specified relative motion path. The second step is to select the relative waypoints and the motion primitives. The final step is to update the waypoints iteratively based on the actual measured relative motion. Waypoint iteration is first executed in simulation and then completed using the actual robots. For performance assessment, we use the mean path speed subject to the relative position and orientation constraints and the path speed uniformity constraint. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on two systems, a physical testbed of two ABB robots and a simulation testbed of two FANUC robots, for two challenging test curves.

### [Inflatable-Structure-Based Working-Channel Securing Mechanism for Soft Growing Robots]()

Soft growing robots are being used in various fields owing to their distinct advantages. However, their ability to manipulate tools in different applications is still challenging. In this paper, we propose an inflatable-structure-based working- channel securing mechanism for soft growing robots. The pro- posed mechanism provides a solution for securing a stable and accessible working channel with pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure, while maintaining the unique advantages of soft growing robots. The proposed soft growing robot can freely transfer materials and tools through its interior channel; therefore, it can adapt and replace equipment based on specific work requirements. This capability enhances the versatility and efficiency of the robot in various applications. Prototyping and experimental validation were conducted to show the performance and capabilities of the robot. The results of the experiments demonstrated that the soft growing robot effectively secured the working channel, enabling the transfer of materials and tools without interference from the inflation pressure. The accessibility of the secured channel was validated through slide-plate and pipe-pulling experiments. The demonstration of the growing mechanism confirmed the ability of the robot to secure a working channel during its growth, whereas the steering demonstration showcased its inherent steering function.

### [Tendon Locking for Antagonistic Configuration and Stiffness-Control in Soft Robots]()

Some applications, such as surgical interventions, require that potential soft robots have the capability to alter their shape and enhance their force output on demand. This paper presents an antagonistic stiffening mechanism combining pneumatic actuation with tendon locking to achieve configuration- and stiffness control. Elongation of a soft pneumatic section, resulting from air actuation, is opposed by constraining the length of integrated tendons. These tendons can be locked in length by pneumatically activated levers at the base of each segment. Hence, tendon locking will not affect the configuration of other segments of a multi-segment manipulator. Our concept achieves a stiffness increase of up to 201.7% and a larger, more uniform radial workspace compared to the widely used pneumatic actuation concept while maintaining the low technical effort required for actuation. We also demonstrate how our actuation concept enables independent control of stiffness levels for individual segments of a multi-segment manipulator and their MR compatibility.

### [Large-Expansion Bi-Layer Auxetics Create Compliant Cellular Motion]()

There is significant interest in creating compliant modular robots that can change their volume. Inspired by how biological cells move, these systems can potentially combine the resilience of modular robotics with the increased environmental interactions of soft robotics. However, current versions have limited speed, expansion, and portability. In this paper, we address these concerns through AuxSwarm, a compliant system composed of auxetic-based robotic voxels. These voxels control their volume through a scissor-like bi-layer auxetic design, growing up to 1.57 times their original size in 0.2 seconds. This combination of speed and expansion is unique across modular soft robots, enabling dynamic locomotion capabilities. We characterize the voxels and demonstrate the versatility of this approach through case studies of 2D bending and 3D cube flipping. AuxSwarm provides a first step towards addressable voxel-based smart materials, while simultaneously addressing the robustness and actuation challenges faced by soft robots

This paper presents the key principles of eViper-2D -- a thin large-area soft robotics platform -- as a new development of the previous extendable Vibrating Intelligent Piezo-Electric Robot (eViper) platform. We first introduce the mechanical, electrical, and control framework of eViper-2D, and then develop systematic and scalable methods to study the impact of diverse actuation patterns on robotic motion dynamics and energy efficiency. By integrating power electronics, communication circuits, piezoelectric actuators, and batteries onboard, the eViper-2D platform enables rapid design iteration and quick evaluation of different control strategies for the multi-actuator soft robot. The platform supports data-driven modeling via automated data acquisition. We show that eViper-2D can provide rich insights into optimizing actuation patterns to achieve agile motion and minimal cost of transport (COT).

### [Bio-Inspired Soft Magnetic Swimming Robot for Flexible Motions]()

Bio-inspired soft robots have gained significant attention for their flexible design and adaptability to various environments, making them suitable for exploration and task execution in confined or hazardous areas. However, the deformation and motion of soft magnetic robots rely on both their structural design and magnetization, which complicates the guided movement and balance maintenance for aquatic environments. In this work, inspired by the flat and symmetrical body of rays, we design a soft magnetic fish-shaped robot capable of flexible motions and trajectory swimming on the water surface. This robot features the muscle made of magnetic elastomer, which connects with the acrylic skeleton and silicone film fins with a soft body. In the external magnetic field, the robot achieves hovering by flapping its fins, driven by the magnetically actuated deformation of its magnetic muscle. Besides, the robot's axial magnetization enables the rapid steering guided by a horizontal field. In experiments, the soft magnetic robot was tasked with performing a looping figure-eight trajectory movement on the water surface, guided by the field gradient generated by a dense planar electromagnetic coils' array. When moving, the onboard circuit board of the robot collected its inertial and temperature information, and sent these data to the host computer via Bluetooth in real-time for motion monitoring. Received data demonstrated that our robot performed the specified afloat swimming trajectory, exhibiting a good stability on its yaw angle during the continuous motion. The soft magnetic swimming robot shows its integrated functionalities in untethered actuation, on-robot sensing, and wireless communication, indicating a significant prospect on applications in inspection and cleaning within narrow pipelines and enclosed mechanical interior spaces.

### [Magnetic Programming of Soft Materials Using Digitally Processed Laser Heating]()

Spatial programming of magnetic soft materials holds immense potential for wide ranging applications in soft robotics, minimally invasive medicine, and haptic interfaces. Despite tremendous and rapid progress in encoding spatially resolved magnetization directions over soft structures, the currently available approaches employ sequential encoding, resulting in slow and tedious processes with limited throughput. In this paper, we present a rapid and parallel magnetic programming strategy based on digitally processed laser heating. Heating above the Curie temperature of the magnetic microparticles embedded within the soft material allows their facile magnetization in desired directions via small external magnetic fields. To achieve parallel and rapid magnetic programming, we developed an integrated digital laser processing and magnetic field generation system, facilitating generation of desired shapes and patterns at high-resolution. Performance of the pattern generation and magnetic soft material are experimentally evaluated. Employing the described magnetic programming framework, shape-morphing of magnetic soft structures with varying magnetic profiles are shown. The proposed approach establishes a rapid and facile encoding procedure with high-throughput magnetic programming potential.

### [Proprioceptive State Estimation for Amphibious Tactile Sensing]()

This paper presents a novel vision-based proprioception approach for a soft robotic finger that can estimate and reconstruct tactile interactions in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The key to this system lies in the finger's unique metamaterial structure, which facilitates omni-directional passive adaptation during grasping, protecting delicate objects across diverse scenarios. A compact in-finger camera captures high-framerate images of the finger's deformation during contact, extracting crucial tactile data in real time. We present a volumetric discretized model of the soft finger and use the geometry constraints captured by the camera to find the optimal estimation of the deformed shape. The approach is benchmarked using a motion capture system with sparse markers and a haptic device with dense measurements. Both results show state-of-the-art accuracies, with a median error of 1.96 mm for overall body deformation, corresponding to 2.1% of the finger's length. More importantly, the state estimation is robust in both on-land and underwater environments, as we demonstrate its usage for underwater object shape sensing. This combination of passive adaptation and real-time tactile sensing paves the way for amphibious robotic grasping applications. All codes are shared on GitHub: https://github.com/ancorasir/PropSE.

### [Fast Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control]()

We present a general approach for controlling robotic systems that make and break contact with their environments. Contact-implicit model predictive control (CI-MPC) generalizes linear MPC to contact-rich settings by utilizing a bi-level planning formulation with lower-level contact dynamics formulated as time-varying linear complementarity problems (LCPs) computed using strategic Taylor approximations about a reference trajectory. These dynamics enable the upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point solver for these LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for the tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot. We also show that the controller is robust to model mismatch and can respond to disturbances by discovering and exploiting new contact modes across a variety of robotic systems in simulation, including a pushbot, planar hopper, planar quadruped, and planar biped.

### [Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation]()

Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes. We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms. This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods. Given the digital assets, we propose a manipulable Real2Sim pipeline that standardizes coordinate systems and scales, ensuring the seamless integration of multiple components. In addition to reconstructing the robotic arm, the surrounding static background and objects can be holistically reconstructed, enabling seamless interactions between the robotic arm and its environment. We also provide datasets covering various robotic manipulation tasks and robotic arm mesh reconstructions. These datasets include real-world motion captured in digital assets, ensuring precise representation of mass and friction, which are crucial for robotic manipulation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in realistic rendering and mesh reconstruction quality for robotic applications.

### [One-Shot Manipulation Strategy Learning by Making Contact Analogies]()

We present a novel approach, MAGIC (manipulation analogies for generalizable intelligent contacts), for one-shot learning of manipulation strategies with fast and extensive generalization to novel objects. By leveraging a reference action trajectory, MAGIC effectively identifies similar contact points and sequences of actions on novel objects to replicate a demonstrated strategy, such as using different hooks to retrieve distant objects of different shapes and sizes. Our method is based on a two-stage contact-point matching process that combines global shape matching using pretrained neural features with local curvature analysis to ensure precise and physically plausible contact points. We experiment with three tasks including scooping, hanging, and hooking objects. MAGIC demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, achieving significant improvements in runtime speed and generalization to different object categories.

### [Incremental Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Prehensile Object Manipulation Using Parallelizable Physics Simulators]()

Few-shot adaptation is an important capability for intelligent robots that perform tasks in open-world settings such as everyday environments or flexible production. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for non-prehensile manipulation which incrementally adapts a physics-based dynamics model for model-predictive control (MPC). The model prediction is aligned with a few examples of robot-object interactions collected with the MPC. This is achieved by using a parallelizable rigid-body physics simulation as dynamic world model and sampling-based optimization of the model parameters. In turn, the optimized dynamics model can be used for MPC using efficient sampling-based optimization. We evaluate our few-shot adaptation approach in object pushing experiments in simulation and with a real robot.

### [Efficient Gradient-Based Inference for Manipulation Planning in Contact Factor Graphs]()

This paper presents a framework designed to tackle a range of planning problems arise in manipulation, which typically involve complex geometric-physical reasoning related to contact and dynamic constraints. We introduce the Contact Factor Graph (CFG) to graphically model these diverse factors, enabling us to perform inference on the graphs to approximate the distribution and sample appropriate solutions. We propose a novel approach that can incorporate various phenomena of contact manipulation as differentiable factors, and develop an efficient inference algorithm for CFG that leverages this differentiability along with the conditional probabilities arising from the structured nature of contact. Our results demonstrate the capability of our framework in generating viable samples and approximating posterior distributions for various manipulation scenarios.

### [Polyhedral Collision Detection Via Vertex Enumeration]()

Collision detection is a critical functionality for robotics. The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases.

### [Flying Calligrapher: Contact-Aware Motion and Force Planning and Control for Aerial Manipulation]()

Aerial manipulation has gained interest in completing high-altitude tasks that are challenging for human workers, such as contact inspection and defect detection, etc. Previous research has focused on maintaining static contact points or forces. This letter addresses a more general and dynamic task: simultaneously tracking time-varying contact force in the surface normal direction and motion trajectories on tangential surfaces. We propose a pipeline that includes a contact-aware trajectory planner to generate dynamically feasible trajectories, and a hybrid motion-force controller to track such trajectories. We demonstrate the approach in an aerial calligraphy task using a novel sponge pen design as the end-effector, whose stroke width is positively related to the contact force. Additionally, we develop a touchscreen interface for flexible user input. Experiments show our method can effectively draw diverse letters, achieving an IoU of 0.59 and an end-effector position (force) tracking RMSE of 2.9 cm (0.7 N).

### [Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound Approach for Fetoscope Tracking by Fusing Optical and 2D Ultrasound Data]()

2D ultrasound (US) guidance is an essential tool in fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) to treat twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). During the procedure, the sonographer and endoscopic surgeon manage different image modalities each with its own field of view. Tacit collaboration is needed between them to visualize the right information and ensure the smooth operation of the procedure. Robotic approaches could simplify this interaction but would require robust localization tools to cope with the complex fetoscopic motion patterns. This study proposes a method for robotic ultrasound (rUS) fetoscope tracking, fusing optical tracking system (OTS) and 2D US imaging. The Kalman filter is defined to guarantee robust online registration and enhance fetoscope tracking. Real-time detection of the fetoscope tip is achieved using the You Only Look Once (YOLO v7) algorithm. Additionally, a US image-based searching strategy is proposed for situations where the optical camera is obstructed. Hybrid position-force control is employed to manipulate the US probe safely against the pregnant abdomen. Validation on a silicone phantom demonstrates accurate tracking results with a mean error below 2.59 mm and tip visibility exceeding 90% is found in most experiments. The proposed system could potentially reduce surgeon workload and training costs for FLP surgery.

### [Guiding the Last Centimeter: Novel Anatomy-Aware Probe Servoing for Standardized Imaging Plane Navigation in Robotic Lung Ultrasound (I)]()

Navigating the ultrasound (US) probe to the standardized imaging plane (SIP) for image acquisition is a critical but operator-dependent task in conventional freehand diagnostic US. Robotic US systems (RUSS) offer the potential to enhance imaging consistency by leveraging real-time US image feedback to optimize the probe pose, thereby reducing reliance on operator expertise. However, determining the proper approach to extracting generalizable features from the US images for probe pose adjustment remains challenging. In this work, we propose a SIP navigation framework for RUSS, exemplified in the context of robotic lung ultrasound (LUS). This framework facilitates automatic probe adjustment when in proximity to the SIP. This is achieved by explicitly extracting multiple anatomical features presented in real-time LUS images and performing non-patient-specific template matching to generate probe motion towards the SIP using image-based visual servoing (IBVS). The framework is further integrated with the active-sensing end-effector (A-SEE), a customized robot end-effector that leverages patient external body geometry to maintain optimal probe alignment with the contact surface, thus preserving US signal quality throughout the navigation. The proposed approach ensures procedural interpretability and inter-patient adaptability. Validation is conducted through anatomy-mimicking phantom and in-vivo evaluations involving five human subjects.

### [Automatic Robotic-Assisted Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy Scanning System]()

Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) is a well-established optical technique for tissue composition assessment which has been validated for tumour detection to ensure the complete removal of cancerous tissue. While point-wise assessment has many potential applications, incorporating automated large-area scanning would enable holistic tissue sampling with higher consistency. We propose a robotic system to facilitate autonomous DRS scanning with hybrid visual servoing control. A specially designed height compensation module enables precise contact condition control. The evaluation results show that the system can accurately execute the scanning command and acquire consistent DRS spectra with comparable results to the manual collection, which is the current gold standard protocol. Integrating the proposed system into surgery lays the groundwork for autonomous intra-operative DRS tissue assessment with high reliability and repeatability. This could reduce the need for manual scanning by the surgeon while ensuring complete tumor removal in clinical practice.

### [Robust and Accurate Multi-View 2D/3D Image Registration with Differentiable X-Ray Rendering and Dual Cross-View Constraints]()

Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns the preoperative model and the intraoperative image of the same anatomy, plays an important role in enabling successful interventional navigation. To alleviate the challenge of limited field of view associated with single intraoperative image, more than one intraoperative images can be leveraged and the multi-view 2D/3D registration is thus needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the combined loss function consisting of the differences between the predicted and ground-truth poses, and dissimilarities (e.g., normalized crosscorrelation) between the simulated and observed intraoperative images. More importantly, the additional cross-view training loss terms are formulated for both pose and image loss, to explicitly consider the cross-view constraints. In the second stage, the test-time optimization is conducted to refine the estimated poses in the coarse stage. Our method leverages the mutual constraints of multi-frame view projection poses to enhance the robustness of the multi-view 2D/3D registration approach. The proposed framework achieves an mTRE of 0.79±2.17 mm on six datasets from DeepFluoro, further advancing beyond the state-of-the-art registration algorithms on this dataset.

### [Robust Robotic Breast Ultrasound Scanning and Real-Time Lesion Localization]()

The inherent flexibility and real-time deformation of breast tissue pose significant challenges for achieving full coverage and accurate lesion localization in autonomous breast ultrasound scanning. This paper introduces a robust finite state machine-based framework that mimics the decision-making process of an experienced physician, dynamically transitioning between global breast scan and fine lesion scan. An autonomous radial and anti-radial global scan pattern ensures comprehensive breast coverage. To avoid lesion misidentification caused by soft tissue movement, a real-time lesion fine scan method is proposed for lesion detection and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system in full coverage tests achieves 7 identified lesions out of 7 existing lesions and maintains a robust localization accuracy of 3.23 mm across phantoms with varying stiffnesses.

### [Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning for Radio Tracer Localisation in Robotic-Assisted Radioguided Surgery]()

Radioguided surgery, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, relies on the precise localization of radioactive targets by non-imaging gamma/beta detectors. Manual radioactive target detection based on visual display or audible indication of gamma level is highly dependent on the ability of the surgeon to track and interpret the spatial information. This paper presents a learning-based method to realize the autonomous radiotracer detection in robot-assisted surgeries by navigating the probe to the radioactive target. We proposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide initial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently navigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments demonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared to conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80% success rate in radiotracer detection. This method has the potential to enhance consistency, reduce operator dependency, and improve procedural accuracy in radioguided surgeries.

### [Improving Probe Localization for Freehand 3D Ultrasound Using Lightweight Cameras]()

Ultrasound (US) probe localization relative to the examined subject is essential for freehand 3D US imaging, which offers significant clinical value due to its affordability and unrestricted field of view. However, existing methods often rely on expensive tracking systems or bulky probes, while recent US image-based deep learning methods suffer from accumulated errors during probe maneuvering. To address these challenges, this study proposes a versatile, cost-effective probe pose localization method for freehand 3D US imaging, utilizing two lightweight cameras. To eliminate accumulated errors during US scans, we introduce PoseNet, which directly predicts the probe's 6D pose relative to a preset world coordinate system based on camera observations. We first jointly train pose and camera image encoders based on pairs of 6D pose and camera observations densely sampled in simulation. This will encourage each pair of probe pose and its corresponding camera observation to share the same representation in latent space. To ensure the two encoders handle unseen images and poses effectively, we incorporate a triplet loss that enforces smaller differences in latent features between nearby poses compared to distant ones. Then, the pose decoder uses the latent representation of the camera images to predict the probe's 6D pose. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, in the real world, we use the trained image encoder and pose decoder for initial predictions, followed by an additional MLP layer to refine the estimated pose, improving accuracy. The results obtained from an arm phantom demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which notably surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving average positional and rotational errors of 2.03 mm and 0.37 deg, respectively.

### [Robot-Based Automatic Charging for Electric Vehicles Using Incremental Learning and Biomimetic Control]()

With the growing popularity of electric vehicles, the demand for robot-based unmanned automatic charging has become both urgent and challenging. Two key challenges need to be addressed: how to efficiently locate the charging port, and how to compliantly insert the connector into the port. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method based on the broad learning system to address the visual positioning error of the charging port. This method allows the robot to transfer and generalize the search skills learned in simulation to real-world scenarios. As a result, the robot can rapidly locate the charging port in real world environments without the need for complex contact state modeling, time-consuming data collection, or model retraining. Subsequently, a biomimetic admittance controller is designed to enable the robot to adapt its compliant behavior online during the plugging process. Finally, experiments are performed on a UR robot to verify the effectiveness of our method.

### [CC-STAR: An Estimation for Contact State Transition Using Reconstruction-Based Anomaly Detection for Peg-In-Hole Assembly]()

For successful peg-in-hole assembly, predefined sub-tasks should be executed sequentially according to the current contact state. Therefore, recognizing contact state transitions is essential in order to determine whether to continue the current task or proceed to the next. In that context, learning-based solutions have shown outstanding results. However, these methods heavily rely on balanced datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the short duration of certain contact states and rare failure cases. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for estimating contact state transitions using anomaly detection through input data reconstruction. The proposed framework operates in a semi-supervised manner, eliminating the need for balanced datasets during training. For input data reconstruction, a convolutional neural network is combined with a variational autoencoder to process various sensor measurements as a multivariate time series. Unlike traditional binary anomaly detection, the proposed anomaly detector scores reconstruction errors and leverages domain knowledge to identify various contact state transitions in the peg-in-hole assembly. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through experiments using a torque-controlled dual manipulator system.

### [Blox-Net: Generative Design-For-Robot-Assembly Using VLM Supervision, Physics Simulation, and a Robot with Reset]()

Generative AI systems have shown impressive capabilities in creating text, code, and images. Inspired by the importance of research in industrial Design for Assembly, we introduce a novel problem: Generative Design-for-Robot- Assembly (GDfRA). The task is to generate an assembly based on a natural language prompt (e.g., “giraffe”) and an image of available physical components, such as 3D-printed blocks. The output is an assembly, a spatial arrangement of these components, accompanied by instructions for a robot to build it. The output geometry must 1) resemble the requested object and 2) be reliably assembled by a 6 DoF robot arm with a suction gripper. We then present Blox-Net, a GDfRA system that com- bines generative vision language models with well-established methods in computer vision, simulation, perturbation analysis, motion planning, and physical robot experimentation to solve a class of GDfRA problems without human supervision. Blox-Net achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 63.5% in the semantic accuracy of its designed assemblies. Six designs, after Blox-Net’s automated pertubation redesign, were reliably assembled by a robot, achieving near-perfect success across 10 consecutive assembly iterations with human intervention only during reset prior to assembly. The entire pipeline from the textual word to reliable physical assembly is performed without human intervention.

### [Geometry and Force-Informed Robotic Assembly with Small Relative Initial Deviations for Circular Electrical Connectors]()

Circular electrical connectors (CECs) have a wide range of applications in scenarios that require reliable connections. However, sockets are often located in narrow scenes with random spatial orientations, complex lighting conditions, and obstructions from cables, making it difficult to accurately locate them through cameras. Besides, due to the complex geometric structure of CECs and the presence of electrode protection slots, the existing research on the assembly of cylindrical or polygonal pegs and holes may not be applicable to the assembly of such components. To this end, this article proposes a novel robotic assembly strategy for CECs with small relative initial deviations, whose core is to design a search trajectory and heuristic force strategy to perceive force/pose (F/P) discontinuity characteristics under different geometric constraints. This assembly strategy is independent of the CEC's size and is not affected by the socket's spatial orientation. The experiments with two different sizes of CECs on a robot equipped with a 6-dimensional force/torque (F/T) sensor are conducted, and the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed assembly strategy for CECs are demonstrated.

### [MatchMaker: Automated Asset Generation for Robotic Assembly]()

Robotic assembly remains a significant challenge due to complexities in visual perception, functional grasping, contact-rich manipulation, and performing high-precision tasks. Simulation-based learning and sim-to-real transfer have led to recent success in solving assembly tasks in the presence of object pose variation, perception noise, and control error; however, the development of a generalist (i.e., multi-task) agent for a broad range of assembly tasks has been limited by the need to manually curate assembly assets, which greatly constrains the number and diversity of assembly problems that can be used for policy learning. Inspired by recent success of using Generative AI to scale up robot learning, we propose MatchMaker, a pipeline to automatically generate diverse, simulation-compatible assembly asset pairs to facilitate learning assembly skills. Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a simulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and automatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free pair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input , and generate a geometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode contact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance parameter to generate realistic parts.

### [CNSv2: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo]()

Visual servo based on traditional image matching methods often requires accurate keypoint correspondence for high precision control. However, keypoint detection or matching tends to fail in challenging scenarios with inconsistent illuminations or textureless objects, resulting significant performance degradation. Previous approaches, including our proposed Correspondence encoded Neural image Servo policy (CNS), attempted to alleviate these issues by integrating neural control strategies. While CNS shows certain improvement against error correspondence over conventional image-based controllers, it could not fully resolve the limitations arising from poor keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, we continue to address this problem and propose a new solution: Probabilistic Correspondence Encoded Neural Image Servo (CNSv2). CNSv2 leverages probabilistic feature matching to improve robustness in challenging scenarios. By redesigning the architecture to condition on multimodal feature matching, CNSv2 achieves high precision, improved robustness across diverse scenes and runs in real-time. We validate CNSv2 with simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of detector-based methods in visual servo tasks.

### [Supervised Representation Learning towards Generalizable Assembly State Recognition]()

Assembly state recognition facilitates the execution of assembly procedures, offering feedback to enhance efficiency and minimize errors. However, recognizing assembly states poses challenges in scalability, since parts are frequently updated, and the robustness to execution errors remains underexplored. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an approach based on representation learning and the novel intermediate-state informed loss function modification (ISIL). ISIL leverages unlabeled transitions between states and demonstrates significant improvements in clustering and classification performance for all tested architectures and losses. Despite being trained exclusively on images without execution errors, thorough analysis on error states demonstrates that our approach accurately distinguishes between correct states and states with various types of execution errors. The integration of the proposed algorithm can offer meaningful assistance to workers and mitigate unexpected losses due to procedural mishaps in industrial settings. The code and data are publicly available.

### [Panoptic Segmentation with Partial Annotations for Agricultural Robots]()

A detailed analysis of agricultural fields is key toward reducing the use of agrochemicals to achieve a more sustainable crop production. To this end, agricultural robots equipped with vision-based systems offer the potential to detect individual plants in the field automatically. This capability enables targeted management actions in the field, effectively reducing the amount of agrochemicals. A primary target of such vision systems is to perform a panoptic segmentation, combining the task of semantic and instance segmentation. Recent methods use neural networks for this task, which typically have to be trained on densely annotated images containing the required ground truth information for each pixel. Gathering these dense annotations is generally daunting and requires domain experts' knowledge in the agricultural domain. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively reduce the annotation bottleneck and yet achieve high performance using partial annotations. These partial annotations contain ground truth information only for a subset of pixels per image and are thus much faster to obtain than dense annotations. We propose a novel set of losses that exploit measures from vector fields used in physics, i.e., divergence and curl, to effectively supervise predictions without ground truth annotations. The experimental evaluation shows that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods targeting to reduce the amount of annotations.

### [Robotic 3D Flower Pose Estimation for Small-Scale Urban Farms]()

The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image, 2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous results. All code will be made available at https://github.com/harshmuriki/flowerPose.git.

### [Fault Management System for the Safety of Perception Systems in Highly Automated Agricultural Machines]()

Safe and reliable environmental perception is crucial for the highly automated or even autonomous operation of agriculture machines. However, developing such a system is challenging due to imperfect perception sensors. This article proposes a fault management system (FMS) for detecting, diagnosing, and mitigating risks that compromise the safety and reliability of perception systems. This article aims to develop an improved image quality safety model (IQSM) for the FMS to detect and diagnose the causes of performance insufficiencies in object detection. The IQSM exhibits remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of about 98%, demonstrating its ability to effectively identify performance insufficiencies under pre-defined hazardous scenarios.

### [Learning to Prune Branches in Modern Tree-Fruit Orchards]()

Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer, achieving a sim30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle planner.

### [Towards Safe and Efficient Through-The-Canopy Autonomous Fruit Counting with UAVs]()

We present an autonomous aerial system for safe and efficient through-the-canopy fruit counting. Aerial robot applications in large-scale orchards face significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning flight paths based on orchard layouts, canopy density, and plant variability. Through-the-canopy navigation is crucial for minimizing occlusion by leaves and branches but is more challenging due to the complex and dense environment compared to traditional over-the-canopy flights. Our system addresses these challenges by integrating: i) a high-fidelity simulation framework for global path planning, ii) a low-cost autonomy stack for canopy-level navigation and data collection, and iii) a robust workflow for fruit detection and counting using RGB images. We validate our approach through fruit counting with canopy-level aerial images and by demonstrating the autonomous navigation capabilities of our experimental vehicle.

### [Language-Guided Object Search in Agricultural Environments]()

Creating robots that can assist in farms and gardens can help reduce the mental and physical workload experienced by farm workers. We tackle the problem of object search in a farm environment, providing a method that allows a robot to semantically reason about the location of an unseen target object among a set of previously seen objects in the environment using a Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed a current state-of-the-art baseline and our ablations. Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84%, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80%, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.

### [Robotic Grape Inspection and Selective Harvesting in Vineyards]()

Driven by the increasing food demand and the need for higher-quality cultivation, precision agriculture grows steadily during the last decade. It involves the application of mobile robots and intelligent robotic technologies in various agricultural field tasks, concerning a variety of crop types. Aiming at compensating for the lack of selective robotic harvesting solutions regarding the high-value crop of grapes, the EU-funded project BACCHUS develops an intelligent mobile robotic system, comprising two independent and cooperative robots: one for the grape inspection and collection of valuable data regarding their maturity level, and one for the bimanual harvesting of grapes in a human-inspired manner. Validated via real-field trials, the proposed autonomous system pushes forward the precision agriculture application for a particularly sensitive crop type in the challenging and heavily cluttered environment of vineyards, facilitating the selective harvesting of high-quality grapes.

### [ProDapt: Proprioceptive Adaptation Using Long-Term Memory Diffusion]()

Diffusion models have revolutionized imitation learning, allowing robots to replicate complex behaviours. However, diffusion often relies on cameras and other exteroceptive sensors to observe the environment and lacks long-term memory. In space, military, and underwater applications, robots must be highly robust to failures in exteroceptive sensors, operating using only proprioceptive information. In this paper, we propose ProDapt, a method of incorporating long-term memory of previous contacts between the robot and the environment in the diffusion process, allowing it to complete tasks using only proprioceptive data. This is achieved by identifying "keypoints", essential past observations maintained as inputs to the policy. We test our approach using a UR10e robotic arm in both simulation and real experiments and demonstrate the necessity of this long-term memory for task completion.

### [Latent Embedding Adaptation for Human Preference Alignment in Diffusion Planners]()

This work addresses the challenge of personalizing automated decision-making systems by introducing a resource-efficient approach that enables rapid adaptation to individual users' preferences. Our method leverages a pretrained conditional diffusion model with Preference Latent Embeddings (PLE), trained on a large, reward-free offline dataset. The PLE serves as a compact representation for capturing specific user preferences. By adapting the pretrained model using our proposed preference inversion method, which directly optimizes the learnable PLE, we achieve superior alignment with human preferences compared to existing solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). To better reflect practical applications, we create a benchmark experiment using real human preferences on diverse, optimal trajectories.

### [Joint Localization and Planning Using Diffusion]()

Diffusion models have been successfully applied to robotics problems such as manipulation and vehicle path planning. In this work, we explore their application to end-to-end navigation -- including both perception and planning -- by considering the problem of jointly performing global localization and path planning in known but arbitrary 2D environments. In particular, we introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end localization and planning stack.

### [Diverse Motion Planning with Stein Diffusion Trajectory Inference]()

Acquiring prior knowledge of trajectory distributions in specific environments can significantly expedite the optimisation process in robot motion planning. Leveraging successful past plans and utilising trajectory generative models as priors offers a clear advantage. Previous studies have proposed various methods to harness these priors, such as using prior samples for initialisation or incorporating the prior distribution into trajectory optimisation through inference. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in encoding multimodal data in high-dimensional settings. In this study, we propose a method that uses diffusion models as priors and employs Stein variational inference with Gaussian Process trajectories to integrate them into a batch inverse denoising process. This approach reduces the computation time required to approximate the posterior distribution of trajectories, particularly when adapting to new, unseen environments. Additionally, we incorporate path signatures into our method to enhance the diversity of the posterior distribution. To validate our approach, we conduct comparative assessments against multiple baseline methods across various scenarios, including 2D planar robots and robotic manipulators. Our experiments demonstrate that our method identifies the optimal solution with significantly reduced computational time.

### [The Ingredients for Robotic Diffusion Transformers]()

In recent years roboticists have achieved remarkable progress in solving increasingly general tasks on dexterous robotic hardware by leveraging high capacity Transformer network architectures and generative diffusion models. Unfortunately, combining these two orthogonal improvements has proven surprisingly difficult, since there is no clear and well understood process for making important design choices. In this paper, we identify, study and improve key architectural design decisions for high-capacity diffusion transformer policies. The resulting models can efficiently solve diverse tasks on multiple robot embodiments, without the excruciating pain of per-setup hyper-parameter tuning. By combining the results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are able to present a novel architecture, named DiT-Block Policy, that significantly outperforms the state of the art in solving long-horizon (1500+ time-steps) dexterous tasks on a bi-manual ALOHA robot. In addition, we find that our policies show improved scaling performance when trained on 10 hours of highly multi-modal, language annotated ALOHA demonstration data. We hope this work will open the door for future robot learning techniques that leverage the efficiency of generative diffusion modeling with the scalability of large scale transformer architectures. Code, robot dataset, and videos are available at: https://dit-policy.github.io

### [Inference-Time Policy Steering through Human Interactions]()

Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift. Videos are available at https://yanweiw.github.io/itps/.

### [Legibility Diffuser: Offline Imitation for Intent Expressive Motion]()

In human-robot collaboration, legible motion that conveys a robot's intentions and goals is known to improve safety, task efficiency, and user experience. Legible robot motion is typically generated using hand-designed cost functions and classical motion planners. However, with the rise of deep learning and data-driven robot policies, we need methods for training end-to-end on offline demonstration data. In this paper, we propose Legibility Diffuser, a diffusion-based policy that learns intent expressive motion directly from human demonstrations. By variably combining the noise predictions from a goal-conditioned diffusion model, we guide the robot's motion toward the most legible trajectory in the training dataset. We find that decaying the guidance weight over the course of the trajectory is critical for maintaining a high success rate while maximizing legibility.

### [Visually Robust Adversarial Imitation Learning from Videos with Contrastive Learning]()

We propose C-LAIfO, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for imitation learning from videos in the presence of visual mismatch between agent and expert domains. We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with visual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space estimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a visually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within this space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a thorough ablation study to justify our design and test C-LAIfO on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how C-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we open source our code.

### [One-Shot Imitation under Mismatched Execution]()

Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods for human-robot translation either depend on paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically pairs human and robot trajectories using sequence-level optimal transport cost functions. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent human videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon human clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. RHyME successfully imitates a range of cross-embodiment demonstrators, both in simulation and with a real human hand, achieving over 50% increase in task success compared to previous methods. We release our code and datasets at https://portal-cornell.github.io/rhyme/.

### [RACER: Rich Language-Guided Failure Recovery Policies for Imitation Learning]()

Developing robust and correctable visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is challenging due to the lack of self-recovery mechanisms from failures and the limitations of simple language instructions in guiding robot actions. To address these issues, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline that automatically augments expert demonstrations with failure recovery trajectories and fine-grained language annotations for training. We then introduce Rich languAge-guided failure reCovERy (RACER), a supervisor-actor framework, which combines failure recovery data with rich language descriptions to enhance robot control. RACER features a vision-language model (VLM) that acts as an online supervisor, providing detailed language guidance for error correction and task execution, and a language-conditioned visuomotor policy as an actor to predict the next actions. Our experimental results show that RACER outperforms the state-of-the-art Robotic View Transformer (RVT) on RLbench across various evaluation settings, including standard long-horizon tasks, dynamic goal-change tasks and zero-shot unseen tasks, achieving superior performance in both simulated and real world environments. Videos and code are available at: https://rich-language-failure-recovery.github.io

### [Improving Vision-Language-Action Model with Online Reinforcement Learning]()

Recent studies have successfully integrated large vision-language models (VLMs) into low-level robotic control by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with expert robotic datasets, resulting in what we term vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although the VLA models are powerful, how to improve these large models during interaction with environments remains an open question. In this paper, we explore how to further improve these VLA models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), a commonly used fine-tuning technique for large models. However, we find that directly applying online RL to large VLA models presents significant challenges, including training instability that severely impacts the performance of large models, and computing demands that exceed the capabilities of most local machines. To address these problems, we propose iRe-VLA framework, which iterates between Reinforcement Learning and supervised learning to effectively improve VLA models, leveraging the exploratory benefits of RL while maintaining the stability of supervised learning. Experiments in two simulated benchmarks and a real-world manipulation suite validate the effectiveness of our method.

### [MILE: Model-Based Intervention Learning]()

Imitation learning techniques have been shown to be highly effective in real-world control scenarios, such as robotics. However, these approaches not only suffer from compounding error issues but also require human experts to provide complete trajectories. Although there exist interactive methods where an expert oversees the robot and intervenes if needed, these extensions usually only utilize the data collected during intervention periods and ignore the feedback signal hidden in non-intervention timesteps. In this work, we create a model to formulate how the interventions occur in such cases, and show that it is possible to learn a policy with just a handful of expert interventions. Our key insight is that it is possible to get crucial information about the quality of the current state and the optimality of the chosen action from expert feedback, regardless of the presence or the absence of intervention. We evaluate our method on various discrete and continuous simulation environments, a real-world robotic manipulation task, as well as a human subject study. Videos and the code can be found at https://liralab.usc.edu/mile.

### [Validity Learning on Failures: Mitigating the Distribution Shift in Autonomous Vehicle Planning]()

The planning problem constitutes a fundamental aspect of the autonomous driving framework. Recent strides in representation learning have empowered vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments, thereby facilitating the integration of learning-based planning strategies. Among these approaches, Imitation Learning stands out due to its notable training efficiency. However, traditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated with the covariate shift phenomenon. We propose Validity Learning on Failures, VL(on failure), as a remedy to address this issue. The essence of our method lies in deploying a pre-trained planner across diverse scenarios. Instances where the planner deviates from its immediate objectives, such as maintaining a safe distance from obstacles or adhering to traffic rules, are flagged as failures. The states corresponding to these failures are compiled into a new dataset, termed the failure dataset. Notably, the absence of expert annotations for this data precludes the applicability of standard imitation learning approaches. To facilitate learning from the closed-loop mistakes, we introduce the VL objective which aims to discern valid trajectories within the current environmental context. Experimental evaluations conducted on both reactive CARLA simulation and non-reactive log-replay simulations reveal substantial enhancements in closed-loop metrics such as Score, Progress, and Success Rate, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Further evaluations against the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate that VL(on failure) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

### [Iteratively Adding Latent Human Knowledge within Trajectory Optimization Specifications Improves Learning and Task Outcomes]()

Frictionless and understandable tasking is essential for leveraging human-autonomy teaming in commercial, military, and public safety applications. Existing technology for facilitating human teaming with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), utilizing planners or trajectory optimizers that incorporate human input, introduces a usability and operator capability gap by not explicitly effecting user upskilling by promoting system understanding or predictability. Supplementing annotated waypoints with natural language guidance affords an opportunity for both. In this work we investigate one-shot versus iterative input, introducing a testbed system based on government and industry UAV planning tools that affords inputs in the form of both natural language text and drawn annotations on a terrain map. The testbed uses an LLM-based subsystem to map user inputs into additional terms for the trajectory optimization objective function. We demonstrate through a human subjects study that prompting a human teammate to iteratively add latent knowledge to a trajectory optimization aids the user in learning how the system functions, elicits more desirable robot behaviors, and ultimately achieves better task outcomes.

### [HybridOcc: NeRF Enhanced Transformer-Based Multi-Camera 3D Occupancy Prediction]()

Vision-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) describes autonomous driving scenes through 3D volume representations. However, the occlusion of invisible voxels by scene surfaces poses challenges to current SSC methods in hallucinating refined 3D geometry. This paper proposes HybridOcc, a hybrid 3D volume query proposal method generated by Transformer framework and NeRF representation and refined in a coarse-to-fine SSC prediction framework. HybridOcc aggregates contextual features through the Transformer paradigm based on hybrid query proposals while combining it with NeRF representation to obtain depth supervision. The Transformer branch contains multiple scales and uses spatial cross-attention for 2D to 3D transformation. The newly designed NeRF branch implicitly infers scene occupancy through volume rendering, including visible and invisible voxels, and explicitly captures scene depth rather than generating RGB color. Furthermore, we present an innovative occupancy-aware ray sampling method to orient the SSC task instead of focusing on the scene surface, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HybridOcc on the SSC task.

### [Temporal Consistency for RGB-Thermal Data-Based Semantic Scene Understanding]()

Semantic scene understanding is a fundamental capability for autonomous vehicles. Under challenging lighting conditions, such as nighttime and on-coming headlights, the semantic scene understanding performance using only RGB images are usually degraded. Thermal images can provide complementary information to RGB images, so many recent semantic segmentation networks have been proposed using RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) images. However, most existing networks focus only on improving segmentation accuracy for single image frames, omitting the information consistency between consecutive frames. To provide a solution to this issue, we propose a temporal-consistent framework for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which introduces a virtual view image generation module to synthesize a virtual image for the next moment, and a consistency loss function to ensure the segmentation consistency. We also propose an evaluation metric to measure both the accuracy and consistency for semantic segmentation. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [SaViD: Spectravista Aesthetic Vision Integration for Robust and Discerning 3D Object Detection in Challenging Environments]()

The fusion of LiDAR and camera sensors has demonstrated significant effectiveness in achieving accurate detection for short-range tasks in autonomous driving. However, this fusion approach could face challenges when dealing with long-range detection scenarios due to disparity between sparsity of LiDAR and high-resolution camera data. Moreover, sensor corruption introduces complexities that affect the ability to maintain robustness, despite the growing adoption of sensor fusion in this domain. We present SaViD, a novel framework comprised of a three-stage fusion alignment mechanism designed to address long-range detection challenges in the presence of natural corruption. The SaViD framework consists of three key elements: the Global Memory Attention Network (GMAN), which enhances the extraction of image features through offering a deeper understanding of global patterns; the Attentional Sparse Memory Network (ASMN), which enhances the integration of LiDAR and image features; and the KNNnectivity Graph Fusion (KGF), which enables the entire fusion of spatial information. SaViD achieves superior performance on the long-range detection Argoverse-2 (AV2) dataset with a performance improvement of 9.87% in AP value and an improvement of 2.39% in mAPH for L2 difficulties on the Waymo Open dataset (WOD). Comprehensive experiments are carried out to showcase its robustness against 14 natural sensor corruptions. SaViD exhibits a robust performance improvement of 31.43% for AV2 and 16.13% for WOD in RCE value compared to other existing fusion-based methods while considering all the corruptions for both datasets. Our code is available at href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SAVID-2A0D/README.m d}{textcolor{blue}{SaViD}}.

### [CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward Projection Based View Transformation]()

Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB (Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4% NDS and 54.0% mAP in 3D object detection.

### [Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning]()

This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive LiDAR sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of LiDAR sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Extensive experiments show that our pruning strategy improves several perception algorithms in multiple tasks.

### [RoBiFusion: A Robust and Bidirectional Interaction Camera-LiDAR 3D Object Detection Framework]()

Camera-LiDAR 3D object detection is currently becoming a crucial component in the field of autonomous driving perception. However, previous models only performed feature fusion in the deep-level BEV hierarchy when dealing with camera-LiDAR feature fusion. This approach lacks interaction with the shallow-level sensor features, which is beneficial in constructing the corresponding BEV features. However, a simple shallow-level feature interaction can introduce sensor noise caused by intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration errors. To address this, we propose RoBiFusion, a novel camera-LiDAR 3D object detection framework designed for effective sensor feature interaction and mitigating sensor noise interference. This framework consists of three submodules: the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, the LiDAR-to-Camera module, and the Camera-to-LiDAR module. Firstly, in the Camera-LiDAR Feature Matching module, we use the cross-attention module to dynamically match the camera features and the LiDAR features, which solves the problem of feature inconsistency caused by noise in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Secondly, in the LiDAR-to-Camera module, we propose a novel depth representation that can effectively mitigate LiDAR noise interference. Thirdly, in the Camera-to-LiDAR module, we introduce deformable attention to help LiDAR feature capture instance-level semantic features. Additionally, we design a novel differentiable and efficient grid sample module to accelerate the process since the bilinear grid sample module in deformable attention is time-consuming and not deployment-friendly. We compared RoBiFusion to the state-of-the-art BEVFusion on the nuScenes dataset and found that RoBiFusion surpasses BEVFusion by 1.5% mAP and 2.4% NDS. Furthermore, we designed a series of ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the aforementioned modules.

### [Towards Accurate Semi-Supervised BEV 3D Object Detection with Depth-Aware Refinement and Denoising-Aided Alignment]()

Recently, camera-based Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) representation has gained significant traction in 3D object detection. However, training high-performance BEV 3D detectors typically requires a large number of annotated samples, which can be costly. Traditional semi-supervised methods for BEV 3D object detection face challenges including loss of rich depth information, inconsistent object representations across spaces, and unreliable pseudo label generation, leading to decreased accuracy and performance. Addressing this challenge, we pioneer the introduction of a semi-supervised BEV 3D object detection framework. Our approach leverages a small set of labeled data alongside a larger set of unlabeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining robust detection performance. Firstly, we propose a depth-based self-refinement module to generate high-quality and stable pseudo labels, which can effectively regulate training with noisy labels. Secondly, we designed a denoising labels regression module that integrates denoising for both labeled and unlabeled data. Thirdly, in order to alleviate object inconsistency, we propose a consistent object-guided alignment method to ensure the consistency of objects in multi-spaces. Finally, our method can be easily plugged into various BEV 3D detection networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art compared to various camera-based 3D detectors tested on multiple public autonomous driving datasets.

### [Open-RGBT: Open-Vocabulary RGB-T Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation in Open-World Environments]()

Semantic segmentation is a critical technique for effective scene understanding. Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation. The project page of Open-RGBT is available at https://OpenRGBT.github.io/.

### [Positioning in Congested Space by Combining Vision-Based and Proximity-Based Control]()

In this paper, we consider positioning in congested space within the framework of Sensor-based Control (SBC) using vision and proximity sensors. Vision acts as primary sensing modality for performing the positioning task, while proximity sensors complement it by ensuring that the robotic platform does not collide with objects in the workspace. Sensor information is combined in a shared manner using the QP formalism where ideas from safety-critical control are used to express inequality constraints. The proposed method is validated through various real experiments.

### [SliceOcc: Indoor 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction with Vertical Slice Representation]()

3D semantic occupancy prediction is a crucial task in visual perception, demanding a simultaneous understanding of both scene geometry and semantics. It plays a pivotal role in 3D scene comprehension and holds great potential for various applications, such as robotic vision perception and autonomous driving. Many previous works leverage planar-based representations like Bird’s Eye View (BEV) and Tri-Perspective View (TPV), which aim to simplify the complexity of 3D scenes while preserving essential object information, thereby facilitating efficient scene representation. However, in dense indoor environments where occlusions are prevalent, directly applying these planar-based methods often leads to difficulties in capturing global semantic occupancy, ultimately degrading model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel vertical slice representation, which divides the scene along the vertical axis and projects spatial point features onto the nearest pair of parallel planes. To harness these slice features, we propose SliceOcc, a camera-based model specifically tailored for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction. SliceOcc utilizes pairs of slice queries and cross-attention mechanisms to extract planar features from input images. These local planar features are then combined to form a global scene representation, which is employed for indoor occupancy estimation. Experimental results on the EmbodiedScan dataset demonstrate that SliceOcc achieves a mIoU of 15.45% across 81 indoor categories, setting a new state-of-the-art performance among RGB-based models for indoor 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

### [Bandwidth-Adaptive Spatiotemporal Correspondence Identification for Collaborative Perception]()

Correspondence identification (CoID) is an essential capability for multi-robot collaborative perception, which allows a group of robots to consistently refer to the same objects in their own fields of view. In real-world applications, such as connected autonomous driving, connected vehicles cannot directly share their raw observations due to the limited communication bandwidth. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach of bandwidth-adaptive spatiotemporal CoID for collaborative perception, where robots interactively select partial spatiotemporal observations to share with others, while adapting to the communication constraint that dynamically changes over time. We evaluate our approach over various scenarios in connected autonomous driving simulations. Experimental results have demonstrated that our approach enables CoID and adapts to the dynamic change of bandwidth constraints. In addition, our approach achieves 8%-56% overall improvements in terms of covisible object retrieval for CoID and data sharing efficiency, which outperforms the previous techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

### [Polyp-Gen: Realistic and Diverse Polyp Image Generation for Endoscopic Dataset Expansion]()

Automated diagnostic systems (ADS) have shown significant potential in the early detection of polyps during endoscopic examinations, thereby reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/Polyp-Gen.

### [DetailRefine: Towards Fine-Grained and Efficient Online Monocular 3D Reconstruction]()

Online monocular 3D reconstruction has attracted widespread attention as it promotes the application of robots in interactive scenarios. Most existing methods focus on 1) real-time reconstruction, 2) accurate voxel featuring learning, and 3) effective voxel sparsification algorithm. To this end, 1) they adopt a coarse-to-fine pipeline, where all non-empty voxels are sent to the next level for refinement. However, this results in over-refinement of flat regions, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, 2) advanced methods focus on exploring view visibility but overlook the discriminability among visible views, which limits the representation of learned voxel features. Moreover, 3) existing sparsification algorithms struggle to distinguish detailed and empty voxels, resulting in either the loss of detailed voxels or the retention of empty voxels. To tackle these challenges, 1) we present Dynamic Detail Refinement (DDR) to allocate more voxels to detailed regions for refinement, which could alleviate the computational burden. Furthermore, 2) we propose Discriminability-Aware Fusion (DAF) to focus on discriminative views, which helps to capture accurate voxel features. In addition, 3) we propose Hierarchical Hybrid Sparsification (HHS) to balance global completeness and local refinement, which helps to preserve detailed voxels at hierarchical levels effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the representative ScanNet (V2) and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

### [DAP-LED: Learning Degradation-Aware Priors with CLIP for Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Deblurring]()

Autonomous vehicles and robots often struggle with reliable visual perception at night due to the low illumination and motion blur caused by the long exposure time of RGB cameras. Existing methods address this challenge by sequentially connecting the off-the-shelf pretrained low-light enhancement and deblurring models. Unfortunately, these methods often lead to noticeable artifacts (eg., color distortions) in the over-exposed regions or make it hardly possible to learn the motion cues of the dark regions. In this paper, we interestingly find vision-language models, eg., Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), can comprehensively perceive diverse degradation levels at night. In light of this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint learning framework, named DAP-LED, which can jointly achieve low-light enhancement and deblurring, benefiting downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, segmentation, and detection in the dark. The key insight is to leverage CLIP to adaptively learn the degradation levels from images at night. This subtly enables learning rich semantic information and visual representation for optimization of the joint tasks. To achieve this, we first introduce a CLIP-guided cross-fusion module to obtain multi-scale patch-wise degradation heatmaps from the image embeddings. Then, the heatmaps are fused via the designed CLIP-enhanced transformer blocks to retain useful degradation information for effective model optimization. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our DAP-LED achieves state-of-the-art performance in the dark. Meanwhile, the enhanced results are demonstrated to be effective for three downstream tasks.	For demo and more results, please check the project page: url{https://vlislab22.github.io/dap-led/}.

### [FusionSense: Bridging Common Sense, Vision, and Touch for Robust Sparse-View Reconstruction]()

Humans effortlessly integrate common-sense knowledge with sensory input from vision and touch to understand their surroundings. Emulating this capability, we introduce FusionSense, a novel 3D reconstruction framework that enables robots to fuse priors from foundation models with highly sparse observations from vision and tactile sensors. FusionSense addresses three key challenges: (i) How can robots efficiently acquire robust global shape information about the surrounding scene and objects? (ii) How can robots strategically select touch points on the object using geometric and common-sense priors? (iii) How can partial observations such as tactile signals improve the overall representation of the object? Our framework employs 3D Gaussian Splatting as a core representation and incorporates a hierarchical optimization strategy involving global structure construction, object visual hull pruning and local geometric constraints. This advancement results in fast and robust perception in environments with traditionally challenging objects that are transparent, reflective, or dark, enabling more downstream manipulation or navigation tasks. Experiments on real-world data suggest that our framework outperforms previously state-of-the-art sparse-view methods. All code and data are open-sourced on the project website.

### [Multi-Robot Object SLAM Using Distributed Variational Inference]()

Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) enables a robot team to achieve coordinated tasks by relying on a common map of the environment. Constructing a map by centralized processing of the robot observations is undesirable because it creates a single point of failure and requires pre-existing infrastructure and significant communication throughput. This paper formulates multi-robot object SLAM as a variational inference problem over a communication graph subject to consensus constraints on the object estimates maintained by different robots. To solve the problem, we develop a distributed mirror descent algorithm with regularization enforcing consensus among the communicating robots. Using Gaussian distributions in the algorithm, we also derive a distributed multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) for multi-robot object SLAM. Experiments on real and simulated data show that our method improves the trajectory and object estimates, compared to individual-robot SLAM, while achieving better scaling to large robot teams, compared to centralized multi-robot SLAM.

### [DVM-SLAM: Decentralized Visual Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Multi-Agent Systems]()

Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) enables multiple agents to work together in mapping unknown environments while simultaneously estimating their own positions. This approach enhances robustness, scalability, and accuracy by sharing information between agents, reducing drift, and enabling collective exploration of larger areas. In this paper, we present Decentralized Visual Monocular SLAM (DVM-SLAM), the first open-source decentralized monocular C-SLAM system. By only utilizing low-cost and light-weight monocular vision sensors, our system is well suited for small robots and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). DVM-SLAM's real-world applicability is validated on physical robots with a custom collision avoidance framework, showcasing its potential in real-time multi-agent autonomous navigation scenarios. We also demonstrate comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art centralized monocular C-SLAM systems. We open-source our code and provide supplementary material online.

### [TCAFF: Temporal Consistency for Robot Frame Alignment]()

In the field of collaborative robotics, the ability to communicate spatial information like planned trajectories and shared environment information is crucial. When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization. The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/tcaff.

### [Effective Heterogeneous Point Cloud-Based Place Recognition and Relative Localization for Ground and Aerial Vehicles]()

Place recognition and relative localization are crucial for realizing the potential of collaboration in ground and aerial robot teams. Many existing works focus only on ground robots and are not well-suited for heterogeneous robot systems in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline based on BEV density image, combined with an enhanced data structure, for place recognition in air-ground robotic collaboration systems. An efficient height alignment algorithm is proposed for relative localization. Extensive experiments on various types of public datasets validate the efficacy of our method compared to other SOTA works. We also show that our method is capable to detect inter- and intra-robot loop closures in a ground and aerial multi-session SLAM system.

### [Distributed Invariant Kalman Filter for Object-Level Multi-Robot Pose SLAM]()

Cooperative localization and target tracking are essential for multi-robot systems to implement high-level tasks. To this end, we propose a distributed invariant Kalman filter~(KF) based on covariance intersection~(CI) for effective multi-robot pose estimation. The paper utilizes the object-level measurement models, which have condensed information further reducing the communication burden. Besides, by modeling states on special Lie groups, and representing uncertainty in corresponding Lie algebras, better linearity and consistency are obtained under the invariant KF framework. We also use a combination of CI and KF to avoid overly confident or conservative estimates in multi-robot systems with intricate and unknown correlations, and some level of robot degradation is acceptable through multi-robot collaboration. The simulation and real data experiment validate the practicability and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

### [MT-PCR: Leveraging Modality Transformation for Large-Scale Point Cloud Registration with Limited Overlap]()

Large-scale scene point cloud registration with limited overlap is a challenging task due to computational load and constrained data acquisition. To tackle these issues, we propose a point cloud registration method, MT-PCR, based on Modality Transformation. MT-PCR leverages a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) capturing the maximal overlap information to improve the accuracy and utilizes images to provide complementary spatial features. Specifically, MT-PCR converts 3D point clouds to BEV images and estimates correspondence by 2D image keypoints extraction and matching. Subsequently, the 2D correspondence estimates are then transformed back to 3D point clouds using inverse mapping. We have applied MT-PCR to Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) point cloud registration on the GrAco dataset, involving 8 low-overlap, square-kilometer scale registration scenarios. Experiments and comparisons with commonly used methods demonstrate that MT-PCR can achieve superior accuracy and robustness in large-scale scenes with limited overlap.

### [Large-Scale Multi-Session Point-Cloud Map Merging]()

This paper introduces LAMM, an open-source framework for large-scale multi-session 3D LiDAR point cloud map merging. LAMM can automatically integrate sub-maps from multiple agents carrying LiDARs with different scanning patterns, facilitating place feature extraction, data association, and global optimization in various environments. Our framework incorporates two key novelties that enable robust, accurate, large-scale map merging. The first novelty is a temporal bidirectional filtering mechanism that removes dynamic objects from 3D LiDAR point cloud data. This eliminates the effect of dynamic objects on the 3D map model, providing higher-quality map merging results. The second noveltyis a robust and efficient outlier removal algorithm for detected loop closures. This algorithm ensures a high recall rate and a low false alarm rate in position retrieval, significantly reducing outliers in repetitive environments during large-scale merging. We evaluate our framework using various datasets, including KITTI, H

### [The qPCRBot: Combining Automated Data Handling, Standardization, and Robotic Labware Transport for Better qPCR Measurements]()

Laboratory automation is a key driver for higher efficiency and reproducibility of experiments and measurements in natural science laboratories. One process that is particularly susceptible to both manual errors in the physical handling of labware, faulty data analyses, and incomplete reporting is the quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). It is a ubiquitous analysis method in biolaboratories to amplify and measure the amount of a specific DNA sequence in a sample. Our system, which we call the qPCRBot , addresses these issues through three key pillars: automating data analysis and handling processes, standardizing data management and system communication protocols, and utilizing a robotic manipulator for labware transport. To achieve this, we developed a SiLA 2-based client-server architecture for unified and standardized access to both the qPCR device and the robot. For the manipulator, we implemented a Cartesian motion generator to ensure proper labware transport. We transform all experiment data to a standardized, XML-based format and integrate a widely-used Laboratory Information Management System for its storage. These developments collectively enable streamlined qPCR measurements without human interaction, thus enhancing both efficiency and reproducibility.

### [Distributed Pursuit of an Evader with Adaptive Robust Path Control under State Measurement Uncertainty]()

This paper presents a distributed pursuit framework for environments with obstacles considering state measurement uncertainty. Our framework consists of two primary components: the computation of safe pursuit regions based on Voronoi cell (VC) and the solution of an adaptive robust path controller based on Control Barrier Function (CBF). Initially, the chance constrained obstacle-aware Voronoi cell (CCOVC) for each pursuer is constructed by calculating separation hyperplane and buffer terms. Subsequently, we formulate chance CBF and chance Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) constraints, using convex approximation to determine their upper bounds. We then find the adaptive robust path controller by solving a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). The advantage of this framework lies in its capability to adaptively compute the path controller and ensure robust collision avoidance among pursuers and with obstacles. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

### [Multimodal Behaviour Trees for Robotic Laboratory Task Automation]()

Laboratory robotics offer the capability to conduct experiments with a high degree of precision and reproducibility, with the potential to transform scientific research. Trivial and repeatable tasks; e.g., sample transportation for analysis and vial capping are well-suited for robots; if done successfully and reliably, chemists could contribute their efforts towards more critical research activities. Currently, robots can perform these tasks faster than chemists, but how reliable are they? Improper capping could result in human exposure to toxic chemicals which could be fatal. To ensure that robots perform these tasks as accurately as humans, sensory feedback is required to assess the progress of task execution. To address this, we propose a novel methodology based on behaviour trees with multimodal perception. Along with automating robotic tasks, this methodology also verifies the successful execution of the task, a fundamental requirement in safety-critical environments. The experimental evaluation was conducted on two lab tasks: sample vial capping and laboratory rack insertion. The results show high success rate, i.e., 88% for capping and 92% for insertion, along with strong error detection capabilities. This ultimately proves the robustness and reliability of our approach and that using multimodal behaviour trees should pave the way towards the next generation of robotic chemists.

### [A Hierarchical Graph-Based Terrain-Aware Autonomous Navigation Approach for Complementary Multimodal Ground-Aerial Exploration]()

Autonomous navigation in unknown environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly in coordinating ground and aerial robots to maximize exploration efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes a hierarchical graph to represent the environment, encoding both geometric and semantic traversability. The framework enables the robots to compute a shared confidence metric, which helps the ground robot assess terrain and determine when deploying the aerial robot will extend exploration. The robot's confidence in traversing a path is based on factors such as predicted volumetric gain, path traversability, and collision risk. A hierarchy of graphs is used to maintain an efficient representation of traversability and frontier information through multi-resolution maps. Evaluated in a real subterranean exploration scenario, the approach allows the ground robot to autonomously identify zones that are no longer traversable but suitable for aerial deployment. By leveraging this hierarchical structure, the ground robot can selectively share graph information on confidence-assessed frontier targets from parts of the scene, enabling the aerial robot to navigate beyond obstacles and continue exploration.

### [Introducing Collaborative Robots As a First Step towards Autonomous Reprocessing of Medical Equipment]()

Ensuring the sterility of medical equipment, particularly endoscopes used in environments teeming with diverse pathogens and drug-resistant bacteria, is crucial for safe medical procedures. However, the complexity of endoscope reprocessing, which involves numerous dexterous manual manipulations, poses significant challenges. Achieving certification for sterilization requires precise, repetitive execution with strict tolerances. In this study, we propose a framework that automates the handling and storage of endoscopes right after the sterilization process and employs compliant collaborative robots to address these dexterous manipulation challenges. In the first stage, we identified the key manipulation skills involved in the process through observations and feedback from medical personnel. In the second stage, we proposed a system that employs a high-level action planner to orchestrate the removal and storage of endoscopes, integrating two collaborative robots and a linear unit. Through real-time force measurements, compliant control, task knowledge, and safety protocols, we establish a system that ensures the safety of both medical equipment and personnel in proximity. In our first experiment, we conducted 50 trials with a 100% reliability rate. Each trial had an execution time of 102 seconds, with a variance of 1.2 seconds. In our second experiment, we performed 10 trials with a human obstructing the transfer path, facing away from the robot. In all cases, the system successfully and promptly detected the collision. This work pioneers the automation of medical reprocessing in sterile environments using tactile robots and addresses the associated challenges.

### [CloudTrack: Scalable UAV Tracking with Cloud Semantics]()

Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used in search and rescue scenarios to gather information in the search area. The automatic identification of the person searched for in aerial footage could increase the autonomy of such systems, reduce the search time, and thus increase the missed person’s chances of survival. In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware. Our approach has several advantages: It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission, and can efficiently track a potentially moving person. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach. We publish the methods source code at https://github.com/utn-blei/CloudTrack.

We introduce the Experiment Orchestration System (EOS), an open-source software framework and runtime offering a comprehensive foundation for laboratory automation. EOS offers an extensible framework allowing users to define labs, devices, tasks, experiments, and optimization criteria using YAML and Python plugins, and also offers a distributed runtime for managing and executing automation. EOS has a central orchestrator that communicates with and controls laboratory equipment to execute tasks. EOS implements autonomous experiment campaigns, parameter optimization, task scheduling, result aggregation, and more. By providing a common infrastructure for laboratory automation, EOS aims to reduce automation implementation barriers and accelerate discoveries in science laboratories.

### [Design of a Bioinspired Jumping Mechanism for Self-Takeoff of Flapping Robot]()

Most birds in nature rely on jumping for take-off. Flapping-Wing robots can flap and fly like birds but require an operator to take off, which are unable to generate sufficient lift to maintain flight at a low airspeed and must accelerate to take-off speed in a short time. It poses a challenge for the design of the jumping mechanism. This study is inspired by the jump-takeoff of birds and designs a simple and lightweight jumping leg, which is capable of storing and releasing the energy with only one degree of freedom. In addition, a prototype was developed and tested, with a wingspan of 2 meters and a mass of 1.6 kilograms, accelerating to 4 m/s in 52 milliseconds by jumping, achieving the jumping take-off from the ground.

### [Embodied Adaptive Sensing for Odor Concentration Maximization in Bio-Inspired Robotics]()

Animals exhibit remarkable adaptability in sensing their environments, employing strategies that optimize information gathering. For instance, silk moths adjust their wing-flapping frequency to detect pheromones, while dogs modify their sniffing behavior by altering sniff height and frequency based on proximity to an odor source. Despite the potential to enhance odor detection for olfactory navigation by drawing inspiration from these natural mechanisms, many existing approaches focus on computationally intensive methods like multi-sensory integration or rely on multiple robots for odor localization, rather than leveraging embodied sensing. In this study, we propose an embodied adaptive sensing strategy that enhances odor detection by implementing an active odor sensor on a legged robot and applying a bio-inspired adaptive robot height control system for dynamically adapting the robot's height based on real-time gas concentration feedback. The control system employs a simple artificial hormone mechanism to regulate the robot height by processing gas concentration derivatives, mimicking biological adaptability. By utilizing the interaction between the active odor sensor, adaptive control system, and the legged body, this approach allows the robot to optimize its height online to capture the maximum gas concentration, thereby reducing the need for complex algorithms and high computational resources. As a result, it offers a more efficient solution for odor-driven tasks, with potential applications in real-world environments.

### [SKOOTR: A SKating, Omni-Oriented, Tripedal Robot]()

In both animals and robots, locomotion capabilities are determined by the physical structure of the system. The majority of legged animals and robots are bilaterally symmetric, which facilitates locomotion with consistent headings and obstacle traversal, but leads to constraints in their turning ability. On the other hand, radially symmetric animals have demonstrated rapid turning abilities enabled by their omni-directional body plans. Radially symmetric tripedal robots are able to turn instantaneously, but are commonly constrained by needing to change direction with every step, resulting in inefficient and less stable locomotion. Inspired by the radial symmetry and maneuverability of brittle stars and octopuses, we introduce a novel design for a tripedal robot that has both frictional and rolling contacts. Additionally, a freely rotating central sphere provides an added contact point so the robot can retain a stable tripod base of support while lifting and pushing with any one of its legs. The SKating, Omni-Oriented, Tripedal Robot (SKOOTR) is more versatile and stable than existing tripedal robots. It is capable of multiple forward gaits, multiple turning maneuvers, obstacle traversal, and stair climbing. SKOOTR has been designed to facilitate customization for diverse applications: it is fully open-source, is constructed with 3D printed or off-the-shelf parts, and costs approximately 500 USD to build. A project page with CAD files, assembly guide, and links to the github repository is posted at https://www.embirlab.com/skootr.

### [AllGaits: Learning All Quadruped Gaits and Transitions]()

We present a framework for learning a single policy capable of producing all quadruped gaits and transitions. The framework consists of a policy trained with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to modulate the parameters of a system of abstract oscillators (i.e. Central Pattern Generator), whose output is mapped to joint commands through a pattern formation layer that sets the gait style, i.e. body height, swing foot ground clearance height, and foot offset. Different gaits are formed by changing the coupling between different oscillators, which can be instantaneously selected at any velocity by a user. With this framework, we systematically investigate which gait should be used at which velocity, and when gait transitions should occur from a Cost of Transport (COT), i.e. energy-efficiency, point of view. Additionally, we note how gait style changes as a function of locomotion speed for each gait to keep the most energy-efficient locomotion. While the currently most popular gait (trot) does not result in the lowest COT, we find that considering different co-dependent metrics such as mean base angular velocity and joint acceleration result in different 'optimal' gaits than those that minimize COT. We deploy our controller in various hardware experiments, focusing on 9 quadruped animal gaits, and demonstrate generalizability to novel and unseen gaits during training, and robustness to leg failures.

### [Bird-Inspired Tendon Coupling Improves Paddling Efficiency by Shortening Phase Transition Times]()

Drag-based swimming with rowing appendages, fins, and webbed feet is a widely adapted locomotion form in aquatic animals. To develop effective underwater and swimming vehicles, a wide range of bioinspired drag-based paddles have been proposed, often faced with a trade-off between propulsive efficiency and versatility. Webbed feet provide an effective propulsive force in the power phase, are light weight and robust, and can even be partially folded away in the recovery phase. However, during the transition between recovery and power phase, much time is lost folding and unfolding, leading to drag and reducing efficiency. In this work, we took inspiration from the coupling tendons of aquatic birds and utilized tendon coupling mechanisms to shorten the transition time between recovery and power phase. Results from our hardware experiments show that the proposed mechanisms improve propulsive efficiency by 2.0 and 2.4 times compared to a design without extensor tendons or based on passive paddle, respectively. We further report that distal leg joint clutching, which has been shown to improve efficiency in terrestrial walking, did not play an major role in swimming locomotion. In sum, we describe a new principle for an efficient, drag-based leg and paddle design, with potential relevance for the swimming mechanics in aquatic birds.

### [A Bio-Inspired Sand-Rolling Robot: Effect of Body Shape on Sand Rolling Performance]()

The capability of effectively moving on complex terrains such as sand and gravel can empower our robots to robustly operate in outdoor environments, and assist with critical tasks such as environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, and supply delivery. Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down hill slopes, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200%. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates.

### [A Programmable Substrate to Study Robots Jumping from Non-Rigid Surfaces]()

This study presents the development, characterization, and demonstration of a tunable substrate for small jumping robots. Jumping robots in the literature are typically evaluated when jumping from rigid surfaces, in contrast to surfaces with more significant compliance or damping that are encountered in the natural world. The aim of this work is to create a physical substrate, or 'ground', for which the effective mass, compliance, and damping can be programmed. This system enables quick testing of various substrate conditions and also allows for the introduction of complex nonlinearities to analyze the interactions between latch-mediated spring actuation (LaMSA) systems and their environment. A mathematical model for the substrate is defined and the system is built with a fast brushless DC motor and controller running on a real-time target machine. The results illustrate the range of compliance and damping that can be achieved, as well as example jumps from the substrate using a 4 g jumper and a 108 g jumping robot.

### [Fine-Tuning Hard-To-Simulate Objectives for Quadruped Locomotion: A Case Study on Total Power Saving]()

Legged locomotion is not just about mobility; it also encompasses crucial objectives such as energy efficiency, safety, and user experience, which are vital for real-world applications. However, key factors such as battery power consumption and stepping noise are often inaccurately modeled or missing in common simulators, leaving these aspects poorly optimized or unaddressed by current sim-to-real methods. Hand-designed proxies, such as mechanical power and foot contact forces, have been used to address these challenges but are often problem-specific and inaccurate. 			 In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for fine-tuning locomotion policies, targeting these hard-to-simulate objectives. Our framework leverages real-world data to model these objectives and incorporates the learned model into simulation for policy improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on power saving for quadruped locomotion, achieving a significant 24-28% net reduction in total power consumption from the battery pack at various speeds. In essence, our approach offers a versatile solution for optimizing hard-to-simulate objectives in quadruped locomotion, providing an easy-to-adapt paradigm for continual improving with real-world knowledge.

### [Think on Your Feet: Seamless and Command-Adaptive Transition between Human-Like Locomotions]()

While it is relatively easier to train humanoid robots to mimic specific locomotion skills, it is more challenging to learn from various motions and adhere to continuously changing commands. These robots must accurately track motion instructions, seamlessly transition between a variety of movements,} and master intermediate motions not present in their reference data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates human-like motion transfer with precise velocity tracking by a series of improvements to classical imitation learning. To enhance generalization, we employ the Wasserstein divergence criterion (WGAN-div). Furthermore, a Hybrid Internal Model provides structured estimates of hidden states and velocity to enhance mobile stability and environment adaptability, while a curiosity bonus fosters exploration. Our comprehensive method promises highly human-like locomotion that adapts to varying velocity requirements, direct generalization to unseen motions and multitasking, as well as zero-shot transfer to the simulator and the real world across different terrains. These advancements are validated through simulations across various robot models and extensive real-world experiments.

### [RINA: Rapid Introspective Neural Adaptation for Out-Of-Distribution Payload Configurations on Quadruped Robots]()

Adaptive locomotion is a fundamental capability for quadruped robots, particularly in real-world scenarios when they must transport novel or out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) payloads across diverse terrains. Previous learning-based methods often tightly couple a locomotion controller's learned parameters with the adaptation process, which requires extensive pre-training or slow online updates when encountering O.O.D. payloads. To enable adaptation of quadruped locomotion to O.O.D. payloads, we propose the novel Rapid Introspective Neural Adaptation (RINA) method that rapidly compensates for differences between expected and actual joint torques caused by O.O.D. payloads. RINA introduces an adaptive residual dynamics representation that decouples the learning model's parameters from those used for adaptation. A new neural operator network is introduced to learn a set of basis functions as the learning model, which are combined using linear coefficients to predict residual dynamics. Then, these residual dynamics are used to adjust the locomotion controller's output, compensating for additional torques induced by the O.O.D. payload. During execution, the mixing coefficients can be rapidly and introspectively adapted on-the-go to generate joint torque compensations for O.O.D. payloads, while keeping the learned basis functions unchanged. Experimental results have demonstrated that our RINA approach well addresses on-the-go O.O.D. payload adaptation on varied natural terrains without collecting and retraining on additional data and outperforms baseline methods.

### [Masked Sensory-Temporal Attention for Sensor Generalization in Quadruped Locomotion]()

With the rising focus on quadrupeds, a generalized policy capable of handling different robot models and sensor inputs becomes highly beneficial. Although several methods have been proposed to address different morphologies, it remains a challenge for learning-based policies to manage various combinations of proprioceptive information. This paper presents Masked Sensory-Temporal Attention (MSTA), a novel transformer-based mechanism with masking for quadruped locomotion. It employs direct sensor-level attention to enhance the sensory-temporal understanding and handle different combinations of sensor data, serving as a foundation for incorporating unseen information. MSTA can effectively understand its states even with a large portion of missing information, and is flexible enough to be deployed on physical systems despite the long input sequence.

### [Robust Robot Walker: Learning Agile Locomotion Over Tiny Traps]()

Quadruped robots must exhibit robust walking capabilities in practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel approach that enables quadruped robots to pass various small obstacles, or "tiny traps". Existing methods often rely on exteroceptive sensors, which can be unreliable for detecting such tiny traps. To overcome this limitation, our approach focuses solely on proprioceptive inputs. We introduce a two-stage training framework incorporating a contact encoder and a classification head to learn implicit representations of different traps. Additionally, we design a set of tailored reward functions to improve both the stability of training and the ease of deployment for goal-tracking tasks. To benefit further research, we design a new benchmark for tiny trap task. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Appendix can be found in project page: https://robust-robot-walker.github.io/.

### [FRASA: An End-To-End Reinforcement Learning Agent for Fall Recovery and Stand up of Humanoid Robots]()

Humanoid robotics faces significant challenges in achieving stable locomotion and recovering from falls in dynamic environments. Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability.

### [DreamFLEX: Learning Fault-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion Controller for Anomaly Situation in Rough Terrains]()

Recent advances in quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive agility and the ability to traverse diverse terrains. However, hardware issues, such as motor overheating or joint locking, may occur during long-distance walking or traversing through rough terrains and lead to locomotion failures. Although several studies have proposed fault-tolerant control methods for quadrupedal robots, there are still challenges in traversing unstructured terrains. In this paper, we propose DreamFLEX, a robust fault-tolerant locomotion controller that enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse complex environments even under joint failure condition. DreamFLEX integrates an explicit failure estimation and modulation network that jointly estimates the robot's joint fault vector and utilizes this information to adapt the locomotion pattern to faulty conditions in real-time, enabling quadrupedal robots to maintain stability and performance in rough terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamFLEX outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios, effectively managing hardware failures while maintaining robust locomotion performance.

### [Curriculum-Based Reinforcement Learning for Quadrupedal Jumping: A Reference-Free Design]()

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution to mastering explosive and versatile quadrupedal jumping skills. However, current DRL-based frameworks usually rely on pre-existing reference trajectories obtained by capturing animal motions or transferring experience from existing controllers. This work aims to prove that learning dynamic jumping is possible without relying on imitating a reference trajectory by leveraging a curriculum design. Starting from a vertical in-place jump, we generalize the learned policy to forward and diagonal jumps and, finally, we learn to jump across obstacles. Conditioned on the desired landing location, orientation, and obstacle dimensions, the proposed approach yields a wide range of omnidirectional jumping motions in real-world experiments. Particularly we achieve a 90cm forward jump, exceeding all previous records for similar robots reported in the existing literature. Additionally, the robot can reliably execute continuous jumping on soft grassy grounds, which is especially remarkable as such conditions were not included in the training stage.

### [OmniShape: Zero-Shot Multi-Hypothesis Shape and Pose Estimation in the Real World]()

We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling performance on challenging real world datasets.

### [Self-Supervised Learning of Reconstructing Deformable Linear Objects under Single-Frame Occluded View]()

Deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as ropes,cables, and rods, are common in various scenarios, and accurate occlusion reconstruction of them is crucial for effective robotic manipulation. Previous studies for DLO reconstruction either rely on supervised learning, which is limited by the availability of labeled real-world data, or geometric approaches, which fail to capture global features and often struggle with occlusions and complex shapes. This paper presents a novel DLO occlusion reconstruction framework that integrates self-supervised point cloud completion with traditional techniques like clustering, sorting, and fitting to generate ordered key points. A memory module is proposed to enhance the self-supervised training process by consolidating prototype information, while DLO shape constraints are utilized to improve reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art algorithms, particularly in scenarios involving complex occlusions and intricate self-intersections.

### [PseudoTouch: Efficiently Imaging the Surface Feel of Objects for Robotic Manipulation]()

Tactile sensing is vital for human dexterous manipulation, however, it has not been widely used in robotics. Compact, low-cost sensing platforms can facilitate a change, but unlike their popular optical counterparts, they are difficult to deploy in high-fidelity tasks due to their low signal dimensionality and lack of a simulation model. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PseudoTouch which links high-dimensional structural information to low-dimensional sensor signals. It does so by learning a low-dimensional visual-tactile embedding, wherein we encode a depth patch from which we decode the tactile signal. We collect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and visual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric shapes. We demonstrate the utility of our trained PseudoTouch model in two downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the object recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a set of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using PseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten touches, surpassing a proprioception baseline. For the grasp stability task, we use ACRONYM labels to train and evaluate a grasp success predictor using PseudoTouch's predictions derived from virtual depth information. Our approach yields a 32% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline relying on partial point cloud data. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available at https://pseudotouch.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [Segment Any Repeated Object]()

Understanding a scene in terms of objects and their properties is fundamental for various vision-based robotic applications, including item picking. To effectively clear a bin, a robot must comprehend objects as graspable entities, often without prior access to models of the target object. This study focuses on open world object segmentation with the additional requirement of assigning identical class labels for repeated instances of the same object. This capability enables item picking tasks with homogeneous bins, filtering out packaging material, and sorting tasks. We propose a novel pipeline for detecting repeated instances of identical objects, building on recent advancements in vision foundation models and exploring approaches for estimating object similarities based on feature embeddings or keypoint correspondence matching. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we establish a new state-of-the-art on ARMBench repeated objects segmentation, a particularly challenging open problem in bin-picking robotics. Additionally, we demonstrate the real-world application of our method integrated into a robot picking cell to showcase its relevance to industrial use cases.

### [ViTa-Zero: Zero-Shot Visuotactile Object 6D Pose Estimation]()

Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring–mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.

### [DoorBot: Closed-Loop Task Planning and Manipulation for Door Opening in the Wild with Haptic Feedback]()

Robots operating in unstructured environments face significant challenges when interacting with everyday objects like doors. They particularly struggle to generalize across diverse door types and conditions. Existing vision-based and open-loop planning methods often lack the robustness to handle varying door designs, mechanisms, and push/pull configurations. In this work, we propose a haptic-aware closed-loop hierarchical control framework that enables robots to explore and open different unseen doors in the wild. Our approach leverages real-time haptic feedback, allowing the robot to adjust its strategy dynamically based on force feedback during manipulation. We test our system on 20 unseen doors across different buildings, featuring diverse appearances and mechanical types. Our framework achieves a 90% success rate, demonstrating its ability to generalize and robustly handle varied door-opening tasks. This scalable solution offers potential applications in broader open-world articulated object manipulation tasks.

### [SEDMamba: Enhancing Selective State Space Modelling with Bottleneck Mechanism and Fine-To-Coarse Temporal Fusion for Efficient Error Detection in Robot-Assisted Surgery]()

Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.

### [Automated Generation of Transformations to Mitigate Sensor Hardware Migration in ADS]()

Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on massive amounts of sensed data to train their underlying	machine-learned components. Common sensor hardware migrations can render an existing machine-learned pipeline inadequate. This necessitates the development of bespoke transformations to adapt new sensor data to the old learned model, or the retraining of a new model with new sensor data. These solutions are expensive, often performed reactively to sensor hardware migration, and rely on empirical reconstruction and validation metrics only which lack knowledge of the features important to the learned model. To address these challenges, we propose PreFixer, a technique that can systematically generate transformations for many types of sensor hardware migration during the ADS development lifecycle. PreFixer collects small datasets using colocated new and old sensors, and then uses that data and the output of the learned model to train an augmented encoder to learn a transformation that maps new sensor data to old sensor data. The trained encoder can then be deployed as a preprocessor to the old learned model. Our study shows that, for a common set of camera sensor hardware migrations, PreFixer can match or improve the performance of the best-performing baseline technique in terms of distance travelled safely with 10% of the training dataset, and take at most half of the training time.

### [Probabilistic Latent Variable Modeling for Dynamic Friction Identification and Estimation]()

Precise identification of dynamic models in robotics is essential to support dynamic simulations, control design, friction compensation, output torque estimation, etc. A longstanding challenge remains in the development and identification of friction models for robotic joints, given the numerous physical phenomena affecting the underlying friction dynamics which result into nonlinear characteristics and hysteresis behaviour in particular. These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and captured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated researchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these methods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical industrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity operations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate the use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to establish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for unidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The friction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional information encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We cast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a standard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the friction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks and are integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The complete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements in the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in terms of open-loop prediction accuracy in comparison with baseline methods, using the Kuka KR6 R700 as a test platform.

### [Learning Three-Dimensional Bin Packing with Adjustable-Order Semi-Online Setting]()

The online setting brings greater flexibility and practicality to the three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) but at the cost of algorithm performance. Existing methods mitigate the performance impact by introducing semi-online settings with look-ahead or buffer zones. However, these methods either fail to fundamentally alter the packing order or reduce packing efficiency. This paper proposes a novel semi-online setting that allows for the observation of multiple items and the selection of one for packing, thereby adjusting the packing order without reducing packing efficiency. We do work for solving the semi-online packing problem via reinforcement learning which faces two real-world challenges: (1) a variable and difficult-to-predict number of observed items, and (2) the obstruction of robotic arm movement by already packed items. On the one hand, we design a policy network capable of adapting to variable item quantities. On the other hand, we introduce a guided bottom-up packing reward function to free up space for robotic arm motion. We show that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of space utilization with the condition of observing at least two items. Further experiments demonstrate the functionality of our reward function, which can guide a virtual robot to complete packing tasks.

### [Multiple Rotation Averaging with Constrained Reweighting Deep Matrix Factorization]()

Multiple rotation averaging plays a crucial role in computer vision and robotics domains. The conventional optimization-based methods optimize a nonlinear cost function based on certain noise assumptions, while most previous learning-based methods require ground truth labels in the supervised training process. Recognizing the handcrafted noise assumption may not be reasonable in all real-world scenarios, this paper proposes an effective rotation averaging method for mining data patterns in a learning manner while avoiding the requirement of labels. Specifically, we apply deep matrix factorization to directly solve the multiple rotation averaging problem in free linear space. For deep matrix factorization, we design a neural network model, which is explicitly low-rank and symmetric to better suit the background of multiple rotation averaging. Meanwhile, we utilize a spanning tree-based edge filtering to suppress the influence of rotation outliers. What's more, we also adopt a reweighting scheme and dynamic depth selection strategy to further improve the robustness. Our method synthesizes the merit of both optimization-based and learning-based methods. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [Magnetometer-Calibrated Hybrid Transformer for Robust Inertial Tracking in Robotics]()

Inertial tracking is vital for autonomous robots and has gained popularity with the ubiquity of low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and deep learning-powered tracking algorithms. Existing works, however, have not fully utilized IMU measurements, particularly magnetometers, nor maximized the potential of deep learning to achieve the desired accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce NeurIT, which employs a Time-Frequency Block-recurrent Transformer (TF-BRT) at its core, combining RNN and Transformer to learn both time-frequency representative features. To fully utilize IMU information, we strategically employ differentiation of body-frame magnetometers for orientation calibration in a sensor fusion manner. Experiments conducted in diverse environments show that NeurIT maintains a mere 1-meter tracking error over a 300-meter distance, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 48.21% on unseen data. NeurIT also performs comparably to the visual-inertial approach (Tango Phone) in vision-favored conditions and surpasses it in plain environments. We share the code and data to promote further research: https://github.com/aiot-lab/NeurIT.

### [MotionGlot: A Multi-Embodied Motion Generation Model]()

This paper introduces MotionGlot, a model that can generate motion across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions, such as quadruped robots and human bodies. By leveraging the well-established training procedures commonly used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce an instruction-tuning template specifically designed for motion related tasks. Our approach demonstrates that the principles underlying LLM training can be successfully adapted to learn a wide range of motion generation tasks across multiple embodiments with different action dimensions. We demonstrate the various abilities of MotionGlot on a set of 6 tasks and report an average improvement of 35.3% across tasks. Additionally, we contribute two new datasets: (1) a dataset of expert controlled quadruped locomotion with approximately 48,000 trajectories paired with direction-based text annotations, and (2) a dataset of over 23,000 situational text prompts for human motion generation tasks. Finally, we conduct hardware experiments to validate the capabilities of our system in real-world applications.

### [Retinex-BEVFormer: Using Retinex to Enhance Multi-View Image-Based BEV Detector in Low Light Scenes]()

Multi-view image-based BEV (Bird's Eye View) 3D perception is gaining attention as an alternative to high-cost LiDAR systems and has achieved notable success. However, there is a significant safety concern for future image-based BEV autonomous driving in low-light conditions (such as nighttime) while the limited research on BEV detectors for these scenes. In this paper, we attempt to enhance low-light BEV perception with illumination-guided feature fusion. We propose Retinex-BEVFormer, which uses illumination information generated by the Retinex theory to enhance the model's robustness to varying lighting conditions and improve detection performance in low-light scenes. Additionally, to address the illumination estimation discontinuity from multi-view images that can adversely affect detection, we propose the MVB-Retinex module, which balances illumination estimation by leveraging overlapping regions between adjacent images. Notably, our proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be applied to any image-based BEV detector method and does not require any additional ground truth supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on the Nuscenes dataset, validating our algorithm in nighttime and daytime scenes. Compared to the baseline, our algorithm achieves a 2.9% increase in mAP on the validation set with minimal computational cost, especially showing a 3.6% improvement in nighttime scene. The experiments demonstrate that our Retinex-BEVFormer effectively improves detection performance in low-light conditions and enhances performance under normal illumination, indicating increased robustness of the BEV detector.

### [Reactive Collision Avoidance for Safe Agile Navigation]()

Reactive collision avoidance is essential for agile robots navigating complex and dynamic environments, enabling real-time obstacle response. However, this task is inherently challenging because it requires a tight integration of perception, planning, and control, which traditional methods often handle separately, resulting in compounded errors and delays. This paper introduces a novel approach that unifies these tasks into a single reactive framework using solely onboard sensing and computing. Our method combines nonlinear model predictive control with adaptive control barrier functions, directly linking perception-driven constraints to real-time planning and control. Constraints are determined by using a neural network to refine noisy RGB-D data, enhancing depth accuracy, and selecting points with the minimum time-to-collision to prioritize the most immediate threats. To maintain a balance between safety and agility, a heuristic dynamically adjusts the optimization process, preventing overconstraints in real time. Extensive experiments with an agile quadrotor demonstrate effective collision avoidance across diverse indoor and outdoor environments, without requiring environment-specific tuning or explicit mapping.

### [Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing for Discrete and Continuous Collision Detection on GPUs]()

This paper presents a set of simple and intuitive robot collision detection algorithms that show substantial scaling improvements for high geometric complexity and large numbers of collision queries by leveraging hardware-accelerated ray tracing on GPUs. It is the first leveraging hardware-accelerated ray-tracing for direct volume mesh-to-mesh discrete collision detection and applying it to continuous collision detection. We introduce two methods: Ray-Traced Discrete-Pose Collision Detection for exact robot mesh to obstacle mesh collision detection, and Ray-Traced Continuous Collision Detection for robot sphere representation to obstacle mesh swept collision detection, using piecewise-linear or quadratic B-splines. For robot link meshes totaling 24k triangles and obstacle meshes of over 190k triangles, our methods were up to 2.8 times faster in batched discrete-pose queries than a state-of-the-art GPU-based method using a sphere robot representation. For the same obstacle mesh scene, our sphere-robot continuous collision detection was up to 7 times faster depending on trajectory batch size. We also performed detailed measurements of the volume coverage accuracy of various sphere/mesh pose/path representations to provide insight into the tradeoffs between speed and accuracy of different robot collision detection methods.

### [Collision Avoidance in Model Predictive Control Using Velocity Damper]()

We propose an advanced method for controlling the motion of a manipulator robot with strict collision avoidance in dynamic environments, leveraging a velocity damper constraint. Unlike conventional distance-based constraints, which tend to saturate near obstacles to reach optimality, the velocity damper constraint considers both distance and relative velocity, ensuring a safer separation. This constraint is incorporated into a model predictive control framework and enforced as a hard constraint through analytical derivatives supplied to the numerical solver. The approach has been fully implemented on a Franka Emika Panda robot and validated through experimental trials, demonstrating effective collision avoidance during dynamic tasks and robustness to unmodeled disturbances. An efficient open-source implementation along examples are provided here: url{https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/articles/haffemayer2025.html}.

### [On the Synthesis of Reactive Collision-Free Whole-Body Robot Motions: A Complementarity-Based Approach]()

This paper is about generating motion plans for high degree-of-freedom systems that account for both static and dynamic collisions along the entire body. A particular class of mathematical programs with complementarity constraints become useful in this regard. Optimization-based planners can tackle confined space trajectory planning while being cognizant of robot and (mostly static) obstacle constraints. However, handling moving obstacles is non-trivial in a real-time setting. To this end, we present the FLIQC (Fast LInear Quadratic Complementarity based) motion planner. Our reactive planner employs a novel motion model that captures the entire rigid robot as well as the obstacle geometry and ensures non- penetration between the surfaces due to the imposed constraint. We perform thorough comparative studies with the state-of- the-art, which demonstrate improved performance. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments validate our claim of generating continuous and real-time motion plans at 1 kHz for modern collaborative robots with constant minimal parameters.

### [Rapid Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for UAVs Enhanced by DVS and Neuromorphic Computing]()

Achieving rapid and accurate dynamic obstacle avoidance is crucial for enhancing the survivability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in hazardous conditions. To accomplish dynamic obstacle avoidance, sensors with high temporal resolution and efficient processing models are required. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) fulfill the sensing requirements, while spiking neural networks (SNNs) address the processing demands. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end obstacle avoidance algorithm for UAVs using only a single monocular DVS as the sensor and further enhance accuracy and speed through our proposed mechanisms. The algorithm consists of three components: ego-motion compensation, an SNN model for movement analysis, and a force filter inspired by spiking neurons. In movement analysis, we propose the temporal potential pooling (TPP) and incremental event (EI) mechanisms to accelerate our SNN model. The real-flight experiments confirm that our algorithm achieves approximately 90% accuracy with a processing latency as low as 4ms on a GPU, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies show that the proposed method maintains high accuracy in movement detection while significantly reducing computational time. Our method operates in real-time, achieves high accuracy, and is feasible across a wide range of environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/AmperiaWang/oanet_s1 for reproducibility.

### [Efficient Collision Detection Framework for Enhancing Collision-Free Robot Motion]()

Fast and efficient collision detection is essential for motion generation in robotics. In this paper, we propose an efficient collision detection framework based on the Signed Distance Field (SDF) of robots, seamlessly integrated with a self-collision detection module. Firstly, we decompose the robot's SDF using forward kinematics and leverage multiple extremely lightweight networks in parallel to efficiently approximate the SDF. Moreover, we introduce support vector machines to integrate the self-collision detection module into the framework, which we refer to as the SDF-SC framework. Using statistical features, our approach unifies the representation of collision distance for both SDF and self-collision detection. During this process, we maintain and utilize the differentiable properties of the framework to optimize collision-free robot trajectories. Finally, we develop a reactive motion controller based on our framework, enabling real-time avoidance of multiple dynamic obstacles. While maintaining high accuracy, our framework achieves inference speeds up to five times faster than previous methods. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [Differentiable Composite Neural Signed Distance Fields for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Indoor Environments]()

Neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) provide a differentiable environment representation to readily obtain collision checks and well-defined gradients for robot navigation tasks. However, updating neural SDFs as the scene evolves entails re-training, which is tedious, time consuming, and inefficient, making it unsuitable for robot navigation with limited field-of-view in dynamic environments. Towards this objective, we propose a compositional framework of neural SDFs to solve robot navigation in indoor environments using only an onboard RGB-D sensor. Our framework embodies a dual mode procedure for trajectory optimization, with different modes using complementary methods of modeling collision costs and collision avoidance gradients. The primary stage queries the robot body's SDF, swept along the route to goal, at the obstacle point cloud, enabling swift local optimization of trajectories. The secondary stage infers the visible scene's SDF by aligning and composing the SDF representations of its constituents, providing better informed costs and gradients for trajectory optimization. The dual mode procedure combines the best of both stages, achieving a success rate of 98%, 14.4% higher than baseline with comparable amortized plan time on iGibson 2.0. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to real-world indoor scenarios.

### [On the Evaluation of Collision Probability Along a Path]()

Characterizing the risk of operations is a fundamental requirement in robotics, and a crucial ingredient of safe planning. The problem is multifaceted, with multiple definitions arising in the vast recent literature fitting different application scenarios and leading to different computational approaches. A basic element shared by most frameworks is the definition and evaluation of the probability of collision for a mobile object in an environment with obstacles. We observe that, even in basic cases, different interpretations are possible. This paper proposes an index we call Risk Density, which offers a theoretical link between conceptually distant assumptions about the interplay of single collision events along a continuous path. We show how this index can be used to approximate the collision probability in the case where the robot evolves along a nominal continuous curve from random initial conditions. Indeed under this hypothesis the proposed approximation outperforms some well-established methods either in accuracy or computational cost.

### [Fast and Accurate Task Planning Using Neuro-Symbolic Language Models and Multi-Level Goal Decomposition]()

In robotic task planning, symbolic planners using rule-based representations like PDDL are effective but struggle with long-sequential tasks in complicated environments due to exponentially increasing search space. Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments. More details are available at http://graphics.ewha.ac.kr/LLMTAMP/.

### [OpenBench: A New Benchmark and Baseline for Semantic Navigation in Smart Logistics]()

The increasing demand for efficient last-mile delivery in smart logistics underscores the role of autonomous robots in enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. Traditional navigation methods, which depend on high-precision maps, are resource-intensive, while learning-based approaches often struggle with generalization in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes the Openstreetmap-enhanced oPen-air sEmantic Navigation (OPEN) system that combines foundation models with classic algorithms for scalable outdoor navigation. The system leverages OpenStreetMap (OSM) for flexible map representation, thereby eliminating the need for extensive pre-mapping efforts. It also employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend delivery instructions and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for global localization, map updates, and house number recognition. To compensate the limitations of existing benchmarks that are inadequate for assessing last-mile delivery, this work introduces a new benchmark specifically designed for outdoor navigation in residential areas, reflecting the real-world challenges faced by autonomous delivery systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed system in enhancing navigation efficiency and reliability. To facilitate further research, our code and benchmark are publicly available.

### [Socratic Planner: Self-QA-Based Zero-Shot Planning for Embodied Instruction Following]()

Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in interactive environments. A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates the Large Language Model (LLM) in performing self-questioning and answering, which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot.

### [Hypergraph-Based Coordinated Task Allocation and Socially-Aware Navigation for Multi-Robot Systems]()

A team of multiple robots seamlessly and safely working in human-filled public environments requires adaptive task allocation and socially-aware navigation that account for dynamic human behavior. Current approaches struggle with highly dynamic pedestrian movement and the need for flexible task allocation. We propose Hyper-SAMARL, a hypergraph-based system for multi-robot task allocation and socially-aware navigation, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Hyper-SAMARL models the environmental dynamics between robots, humans, and points of interest (POIs) using a hypergraph, enabling adaptive task assignment and socially-compliant navigation through a hypergraph diffusion mechanism. Our framework, trained with MARL, effectively captures interactions between robots and humans, adapting tasks based on real-time changes in human activity. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper-SAMARL outperforms baseline models in terms of social navigation, task completion efficiency, and adaptability in various simulated scenarios.

### [Bootstrapping Object-Level Planning with Large Language Models]()

We introduce a new method that extracts knowledge from a large language model (LLM) to produce object-level plans, which describe high-level changes to object state, and uses them to bootstrap task and motion planning (TAMP). Existing work uses LLMs to directly output task plans or generate goals in representations like PDDL. However, these methods fall short because they rely on the LLM to do the actual planning or output a hard-to-satisfy goal. Our approach instead extracts knowledge from an LLM in the form of plan schemas as an object-level representation called functional object-oriented networks (FOON), from which we automatically generate PDDL subgoals. Our method markedly outperforms alternative planning strategies in completing several pick-and-place tasks in simulation.

### [GPT-4V(ision) for Robotics: Multimodal Task Planning from Human Demonstration]()

We introduce a pipeline that enhances a general-purpose Vision Language Model, GPT-4V(ision), to facilitate one-shot visual teaching for robotic manipulation. This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and outputs executable robot programs that incorporate insights into affordances. The process begins with GPT-4V analyzing the videos to obtain textual explanations of environmental and action details. A GPT-4-based task planner then encodes these details into a symbolic task plan. Subsequently, vision systems spatially and temporally ground the task plan in the videos—objects are identified using an open-vocabulary object detector, and hand-object interactions are analyzed to pinpoint moments of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows for the gathering of affordance information (e.g., grasp types, waypoints, and body postures) critical for robot execution. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a one-shot manner. Meanwhile, quantitative tests have revealed instances of hallucination in GPT-4V, highlighting the importance of incorporating human supervision within the pipeline. The prompts of GPT-4V/GPT-4 are available at this project page: https://microsoft.github.io/GPT4Vision-Robot-Manipulation-Prompts/

### [Action Contextualization: Adaptive Task Planning and Action Tuning Using Large Language Models]()

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising frontier in robotic task planning by leveraging extensive human knowledge. Nevertheless, the current literature often overlooks the critical aspects of robots' adaptability and error correction. This work aims to overcome this limitation by enabling robots to modify their motions and select the most suitable task plans based on the context. We introduce a novel framework to achieve action contextualization, aimed at tailoring robot actions to the context of specific tasks, thereby enhancing adaptability through applying LLM-derived contextual insights. Our framework integrates motion metrics that evaluate robot performances for each motion to resolve redundancy in planning. Moreover, it supports online feedback between the robot and the LLM, enabling immediate modifications to the task plans and corrections of errors. An overall success rate of 81.25% has been achieved through extensive experimental validation. Finally, when integrated with dynamical system (DS)-based robot controllers, the robotic arm-hand system demonstrates its proficiency in autonomously executing LLM-generated motion plans for sequential table-clearing tasks, rectifying errors without human intervention, and showcasing robustness against external disturbances. Our proposed framework also features the potential to be integrated with modular control approaches, significantly enhancing robots' adaptability and autonomy in performing sequential tasks in the real world.

### [CLSTR: Capability-Level System for Tracking Robots]()

For human operators to effectively task teams of robots, it is critical that they maintain situational awareness about the status of those robots. However, maintaining this situational awareness becomes particularly difficult when there are dynamic changes not only in the members of the robot team, but also in the capabilities of those robots. Prior work has shown that situational awareness can be supported through interfaces that effectively visualize task-relevant information. As such, in this work, we introduce a Capability-Level System for Tracking Robots (CLSTR), a new visualization for supporting operators to maintain an appropriate level of situational awareness over the capabilities of a dynamic robot team. In evaluating CLSTR through an online human-subject study (n=123), we found that a combination of different visual elements within an interface like the use of icons to summarize robot capabilities and animations to indicate team changes can help operators maintain awareness over robot teams.

### [Mitigating Side Effects in Multi-Agent Systems Using Blame Assignment]()

When independently trained or designed robots are deployed in a shared environment, their combined actions can lead to unintended negative side effects (NSEs). To ensure safe and efficient operation, robots must optimize task performance while minimizing the penalties associated with NSEs, balancing individual objectives with collective impact. We model the problem of mitigating NSEs in a cooperative multi-agent system as a bi-objective lexicographic decentralized Markov decision process. We assume independence of transitions and rewards with respect to the robots' tasks, but the joint NSE penalty creates a form of dependence in this setting. To improve scalability, the joint NSE penalty is decomposed into individual penalties for each robot using credit assignment, which facilitates decentralized policy computation. We empirically demonstrate, using mobile robots and in simulation, the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in mitigating NSEs. Code: https://tinyurl.com/RECON-NSE-Mitigation

### [Decentralized Drone Swaps for Online Rebalancing of Drone Delivery Tasks]()

Recent research has seen the advancement of drone depot models as a promising way to allocate drones for large-scale task completion. Applications of these drone depot models include data collection, environmental monitoring, package delivery, and more. This paper focuses on sharing agents between static depots for task allocation based on expected demand. We model the problem as a Binary Nonlinear Program, then derive an iterative neighborhood search based on solving a series of Binary Linear Programs to drive towards the optimal configuration of agents for each depot. We show that our method is more tractable than a Branch and Bound approach for this model as problem complexity grows. We also show through simulations that with near optimal allocation between local depots, the overall system performance will outperform greedy and non-sharing approaches.

### [A Fairness-Oriented Control Framework for Safety-Critical Multi-Robot Systems: Alternative Authority Control]()

This paper proposes a fair control framework for multi-robot systems, which integrates the newly introduced Alternative Authority Control (AAC) and Flexible Control Barrier Function (F-CBF). Control authority refers to a single robot which can plan its trajectory while considering others as moving obstacles, meaning the other robots do not have authority to plan their own paths. The AAC method dynamically distributes the control authority, enabling fair and coordinated movement across the system. This approach significantly improves computational efficiency, scalability, and robustness in complex environments. The proposed F-CBF extends traditional CBFs by incorporating obstacle shape, velocity, and orientation. F-CBF enhances safety by accurate dynamic obstacle avoidance. The framework is validated through simulations in multi-robot scenarios, demonstrating its safety, robustness and computational efficiency.

### [FogROS2-PLR: Probabilistic Latency-Reliability for Cloud Robotics]()

Cloud robotics enables robots to offload complex computational tasks to cloud servers for performance, cost, and ease of management. However, the network and cloud computing infrastructure are not designed for reliable timing guarantee, leading to fluctuating Quality-of-Service (QoS). In this work, we formulate an impossibility triangle of latency reliability, singleton deployment and commodity hardware. The theorem implicates that providing replicated resources with uncorrelated failures exponentially reduces the probability of missing a deadline. We present FogROS2-Probabilistic Latency Reliability (RLR) that uses multiple independent network interfaces to send requests to replicated cloud resources and uses the first response back. We design routing mechanisms to discover, connect, and route through non-default network interfaces on robots. FogROS2-PLR optimizes the selection of interfaces to servers by minimizing the probability of missing a deadline. We conduct a cloud-connected driving experiment with two 5G service providers, demonstrating FogROS2-PLR effectively provides smooth service quality even if one of the service providers experiences low coverage and base station handover. We use 99 Percentile (P99) latency to evaluate anomalous long-tail latency behavior. In the experiment, FogROS2-PLR improves P99 latency by up to 3.7x compared to using one service provider. We deploy FogROS2-PLR on a physical Stretch 3 robot with an indoor human-tracking task. Even in a fully covered Wi-Fi and 5G environment, FogROS2-PLR improves the responsiveness of the robot by reducing 36% of mean latency and 33% P99 latency. Code and supplementary can be found on website.

### [Jointly Assigning Processes to Machines and Generating Plans for Autonomous Mobile Robots in a Smart Factory]()

A modern smart factory runs a manufacturing procedure using a collection of programmable machines. Typically, materials are ferried between these machines using a team of mobile robots. To embed a manufacturing procedure in a smart factory, a factory operator must a) assign its processes to the smart factory's machines and b) determine how agents should carry materials between machines. A good embedding maximizes the smart factory's throughput; the rate at which it outputs products. Existing smart factory management systems solve the aforementioned problems sequentially, limiting the throughput that they can achieve. In this paper we introduce ACES, the Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, the first solver which jointly optimizes the assignment of processes to machines and the assignment of paths to agents. We evaluate ACES and show that it can scale to real industrial scenarios.

### [A Control Scheme for Collaborative Object Transportation between a Human and a Quadruped Robot Using the MIGHTY Suction Cup]()

In this work, a control scheme for human-robot collaborative object transportation is proposed, considering a quadruped robot equipped with the MIGHTY suction cup that serves both as a gripper for holding the object and a force/torque sensor. The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed, which is based on a barrier artificial potential. The proposed control scheme is proven to be passive and its performance is demonstrated through experimental evaluations conducted using the Unitree Go1 robot equipped with the MIGHTY suction cup.

### [DTRT: Enhancing Human Intent Estimation and Role Allocation for Physical Human-Robot Collaboration]()

In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration. Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation, achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.

### [Learning-Based Dynamic Robot-To-Human Handover]()

This paper presents a novel learning-based approach to dynamic robot-to-human handover, addressing the challenges of delivering objects to a moving receiver. We hypothesize that dynamic handover, where the robot adjusts to the receiver’s movements, results in more efficient and comfortable interaction compared to static handover, where the receiver is assumed to be stationary. To validate this, we developed a nonparametric method for generating continuous handover motion, conditioned on the receiver's movements, and trained the model using a dataset of 1,000 human-to-human handover demonstrations. We integrated preference learning for improved handover effectiveness and applied impedance control to ensure user safety and adaptiveness. The approach was evaluated in both simulation and real-world settings, with user studies demonstrating that dynamic handover significantly reduces handover time and improves user comfort compared to static methods. Videos and demonstrations of our approach are available at https://zerotohero7886.github.io/dyn-r2h-handover/.

### [A Novel Dynamic Motion Primitives Framework for Safe Human-Robot Collaboration]()

Learning by demonstration techniques are gaining popularity within the human-robot collaboration (HRC) scenarios. This is because they allow to deeply exploit the versatility of collaborative robots. In this context, dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) have become a standard method for enabling human operators to easily teach tasks to robots. However, DMPs have two main limitations. First, they may encounter difficulties in generalizing some tasks, which can lead to non-intuitive behavior. Second, it is not guaranteed that the output of DMPs is compliant with ISO/TS 15066, which provides guidelines for assessing safety in collaborative scenarios. This work aims to address these two issues by introducing a novel control pipeline. This pipeline leverages a new variant of DMPs, called Swap DMPs (SDMPs), introduced in this work. The SDMPs enable a more intuitive behavior when the robot reproduces the learned task. Subsequently, SDMPs are encoded into a new optimization problem that ensures the robot complies with the Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) collaborative mode. The proposed approach has been experimentally validated and compared with traditional DMPs in both simulation and a real scenario, where a UR5e and a human operator collaborate on a polishing task.

### [Depth Restoration of Hand-Held Transparent Objects for Human-To-Robot Handover]()

Transparent objects are common in daily life, while their optical properties pose challenges for RGB-D cameras to capture accurate depth information. This issue is further amplified when these objects are hand-held, as hand occlusions further complicate depth estimation. For assistant robots, however, accurately perceiving hand-held transparent objects is critical to effective human-robot interaction. This paper presents a Hand-Aware Depth Restoration (HADR) method based on creating an implicit neural representation function from a single RGB-D image. The proposed method utilizes hand posture as an important guidance to leverage semantic and geometric information of hand-object interaction. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we create a high-fidelity synthetic dataset named TransHand-14K with a real-to-sim data generation scheme. Experiments show that our method has better performance and generalization ability compared with existing methods. We further develop a real-world human-to-robot handover system based on HADR, demonstrating its potential in human-robot interaction applications.

### [Leveraging Semantic and Geometric Information for Zero-Shot Robot-To-Human Handover]()

Human-robot interaction (HRI) encompasses a wide range of collaborative tasks, with handover being one of the most fundamental. As robots become more integrated into human environments, the potential for service robots to assist in handing objects to humans is increasingly promising. In robot-to-human (R2H) handover, selecting the optimal grasp is crucial for success, as it requires avoiding interference with the human's preferred grasp region and minimizing intrusion into their workspace. Existing methods either inadequately consider geometric information or rely on data-driven approaches, which often struggle to generalize across diverse objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot system that combines semantic and geometric information to generate optimal handover grasps. Our method first identifies grasp regions using semantic knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and, by incorporating customized visual prompts, achieves finer granularity in region grounding. A grasp is then selected based on grasp distance and approach angle to maximize human ease and avoid interference. We validate our approach through ablation studies and real-world comparison experiments. Results demonstrate that our system improves handover success rates and provides a more user-preferred interaction experience. Videos, appendixes and more are available at https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-handover/.

### [Human-To-Robot Handover Control of an Autonomous Mobile Robot Based on Hand-Masked Object Pose Estimation]()

This paper presents a human-to-robot handover design for an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). The developed control system enables the AMR to navigate to a specific person and grasp the object that the person wants to handover. This paper proposes a motion planning algorithm for grasping an unseen object held in hand. Through hand detection and segmentation, the hand region is masked and removed from the acquired depth image, which is used to estimate the object pose for grasping. For grasp pose determination, we propose to add the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to the Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) model to enhance the recognition rate. For the object-grasp task, the AMR localizes the object in person’s hand, and uses the Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based controller to simultaneously control the mobile base and manipulator to grasp the object. A laboratory-developed mobile manipulator, equipped with a 6-DoF TM5M-900 is used for experimental verification. The experimental results show an average handover success rate of 81% for five different objects.

### [Learning Multimodal Confidence for Intention Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction]()

The rapid development of collaborative robotics has provided a new possibility of helping the elderly who has difficulties in daily life, allowing robots to operate according to specific intentions. However, efficient human-robot cooperation requires natural, accurate and reliable intention recognition in shared environments. The current paramount challenge for this is reducing the uncertainty of multimodal fused intention to be recognized and reasoning adaptively a more reliable result despite current interactive condition. In this work we propose a novel learning-based multimodal fusion framework Batch Multimodal Confidence Learning for Opinion Pool (BMCLOP). Our approach combines Bayesian multimodal fusion method and batch confidence learning algorithm to improve accuracy, uncertainty reduction and success rate given the interactive condition. In particular, the generic and practical multimodal intention recognition framework can be easily extended further. Our desired assistive scenarios consider three modalities gestures, speech and gaze, all of which produce categorical distributions over all the finite intentions. The proposed method is validated with a six-DoF robot through extensive experiments and exhibits high performance compared to baselines.

### [Optimize and Coordinate Multiple DMPs under Constraints to Achieve a Collaborative Manipulation Task]()

This paper addresses a significant challenge in achieving collaborative tasks; how can a robot or multiple robots, endowed with a library of pre-learned primitive movements, generate multiple simultaneous coordinated robotic movements, adapting and optimizing those in the library, to complete one collaborative task? This work can thus be seen as a follow-up to the work with a motion presented as dynamic movement primitive (DMP) that now considers collaborative tasks and the existence of multiple robots/manipulators. Specifically, we start with a simple task using one DMP and extend it to accommodate the coordinated execution of multiple DMPs in robots with multiple manipulators or---alternatively---multiple robots with a single manipulator. We investigate mechanisms to jointly optimize multiple DMPs to perform one task in a coordinated fashion. The joint trajectory is built from initial DMPs learned for a single manipulator, and its optimization must comply with task-specific constraints. We illustrate the application of our approach both in a simulated environment and in a simulated and real Baxter robot.

### [A Modified Resistance Model for Magnetic Honeycomb Robots to Navigate in Low Reynolds Number Fluids]()

In recent years, magnetically controlled microrobots have garnered significant attention. This paper presents the H-robot, a self-designed microrobot featuring an innovative structure. The H-robot features a honeycomb porous spherical design specifically engineered to enhance cargo capacity. A new dynamic model for this structure has been developed for low Reynolds number fluid environments, along with a robust backstepping sliding mode control (RBSMC) strategy. Experiments were conducted in a calibrated magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator to achieve precise motion control. The results demonstrate that the H-robot accurately tracks standard trajectories, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.09×10−4 m for the Number-8 path and 8.29×10−4 m for the S-shaped path. Additionally, the proposed resistance model enhances tracking accuracy by 73.61% compared to traditional models, effectively adjusting the dynamic behavior of the H-robot in low Reynolds number fluids and significantly improving its motion performance. Finally, path planning experiments in a maze demonstrate the H-robot’s ability to navigate and avoid obstacles.

### [Manual, Semi or Fully Autonomous Flipper Control? a Framework for Fair Comparison]()

We investigated the performance of existing semi- and fully autonomous methods for controlling flipper-based skid-steer robots. Our study involves reimplementation of these methods for fair comparison and it introduces a novel semi-autonomous control policy that provides a compelling trade-off among current state-of-the-art approaches. We also propose new metrics for assessing cognitive load and traversal quality and offer a benchmarking interface for generating Quality-Load graphs from recorded data. Our results, presented in a 2D Quality-Load space, demonstrate that the new control policy effectively bridges the gap between autonomous and manual control methods. Additionally, we reveal a surprising fact that fully manual, continuous control of all six degrees of freedom remains highly effective when performed by an experienced operator on a well-designed analog controller from third person view.

This paper proposes a safety-critical locomotion control framework employed for legged robots exploring through infeasible path in obstacle-rich environments. Our research focus is on achieving safe and robust locomotion where robots confront unavoidable obstacles en route to their designated destination. Through the utilization of outcomes from physical interactions with unknown objects, we establish a hierarchy among the safety-critical conditions avoiding the obstacles. This hierarchy enables the generation of a safe reference trajectory that adeptly mitigates conflicts among safety conditions and reduce the risk while controlling the robot toward its destination without additional motion planning methods. In addition, robust bipedal locomotion is achieved by utilizing the Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum model, coupled with a disturbance observer addressing a disturbance from the physical interaction.

### [Predictive Kinematic Coordinate Control for Aerial Manipulators Based on Modified Kinematics Learning]()

High-precision manipulation has always been a developmental goal for aerial manipulators. This paper investigates the kinematic coordinate control issue in aerial manipulators. We propose a predictive kinematic coordinate control method based on model learning, which includes a learning-based modified kinematic model and a model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on weight allocation. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach offers several attractive features. First, the kinematic model incorporates closed-loop dynamics characteristics and online residual learning. Compared to methods that do not consider closed-loop dynamics and residuals, our proposed method has improved accuracy by 59.6%. Second, a MPC method that considers weight allocation has been proposed, which can coordinate the motion strategies of quadcopters and manipulators. Compared to methods that do not consider weight allocation, the proposed method can meet the requirements of more tasks. The proposed approach is verified through complex trajectory tracking and moving target tracking experiments. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [Affine Transformation-Based Perfectly Undetectable False Data Injection Attacks on Remote Manipulator Kinematic Control with Attack Detector]()

This paper demonstrates the viability of perfectly undetectable affine transformation attacks against robotic manipulators where intelligent attackers can inject multiplicative and additive false data while remaining completely hidden from system users. The attacker can implement these communication line attacks by satisfying three Conditions presented in this work. These claims are experimentally validated on a FANUC 6 degree of freedom manipulator by comparing a nominal (non-attacked) trial and a detectable attack case against three perfectly undetectable trajectory attack Scenarios: scaling, reflection, and shearing. The results show similar observed end effector error for the attack Scenarios and the nominal case, indicating that the perfectly undetectable affine transformation attackmethod keeps the attacker perfectly hidden while enabling them to attack manipulator trajectories.

### [CDA: Covert Deception Attacks in Multi-Agent Resource Scheduling]()

In this letter, we address the critical security concerns in multi-agent systems, where illegal infiltration is commonly used to convert agents into malicious entities. Existing research predominantly focuses on explicit malicious attack patterns. Our work introduces a covert deception attack framework in the context of multi-agent resource scheduling scenarios. We first highlight vulnerabilities in scheduling strategies based on time and path costs. Exploiting these weaknesses, an infiltrated agent clandestinely gathers motion characteristics of other agents while posing as a teammate. Using these motion characteristics, the infiltrated agent employs an LSTM architecture to learn and predict congestion areas, thereby designing attack paths with greater time efficiency. This approach allows the infiltrated agent to secure additional resources and evade capture more effectively. Validation through simulation and real-world experiments demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, underscoring the importance of evaluating covert attacks in risk assessments within multi-agent systems.

### [Early Model-Based Safety Analysis for Collaborative Robotic Systems (I)]()

The current era is marked by an accelerated digitization of manufacturing processes, with robotic systems increasingly integrated into various workflows. Yet, despite significant advancements, it is impractical to fully automate certain tasks due to prohibitive costs and technical constraints. As a result, there’s a growing emphasis on human-robot collaboration (HRC) for intricate operations. In HRC scenarios, humans and robots co-inhabit the same work environment, operating side by side. More than just mere coexistence in the same space, they actively collaborate on shared tasks, thus raising the stakes in terms of safety. The dynamic behavior of robots must be synchronized with the anticipated and unexpected human actions, adding another layer of complexity to the safety considerations. It is essential to conduct comprehensive safety analyses that identify potential risks that pose harm to the human operator. As a proactive measure to foster early-stage safety and risk analysis, we propose the use of goal models. The approach enables the specification of safety threats within the HRC context, thereby facilitating the development of safety tasks and supportive monitoring mechanisms. This approach helps in the refinement and implementation of safety measures, ensuring a secure and productive environment for human-robot collaboration.

### [Investigating Security Threats in Multi-Tenant ROS 2 Systems]()

Robot Operating System (ROS) has been widely used to develop robotic applications. The first generation of ROS generally lacks security features, and ROS 2 is introduced with security support. However, security concerns still exist for running ROS in practical multi-tenant environments. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the security of ROS 2. We focus on vulnerabilities in ROS nodes and topics and intend to explore methods to break the isolation and security mechanisms systematically. We devise a set of strategies that can be exploited by attackers to escalate privilege or cause information leakage in a multi-tenant environment. These attacks can bypass existing isolation and security mechanisms, including ROS 2’s native security module. To validate our findings, we employ simulations across various real-world scenarios to demonstrate how attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass existing security mechanisms. Finally, we present several defense practices to mitigate these identified threats.

Through self-supervised learning, we accurately locate diverse adversarial patches without prior attack knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient adaptive patch inpainting method to mitigate patch impact while maintaining visual coherence. Experiments show that our methods effectively boost the robustness of visual perception models against various adversarial patches across different tasks.

### [Perfectly Undetectable False Data Injection Attacks on Encrypted Bilateral Teleoperation System Based on Dynamic Symmetry and Malleability]()

This paper investigates the vulnerability of bilateral teleoperation systems to perfectly undetectable False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Teleoperation, one of major applications in robotics, involves a leader manipulator operated by a human and a follower manipulator at a remote site, connected via a communication channel. While this setup enables operation in challenging environments, it also introduces cybersecurity risks, particularly in the communication link. The paper focuses on a specific class of cyberattacks: perfectly undetectable FDIAs, where attackers alter signals without leaving detectable traces at all. Compared to previous research on linear and first-order nonlinear systems, this paper examines bilateral teleoperation systems with second-order nonlinear manipulator dynamics. The paper derives mathematical conditions based on Lie Group theory that enable such attacks, demonstrating how an attacker can modify the follower manipulator's motion while the operator perceives normal operation through the leader device. This vulnerability challenges conventional detection methods based on observable changes and highlights the need for advanced security measures in teleoperation systems. To validate the theoretical results, the paper presents experimental demonstrations using a teleoperation system connecting robots in the US and Japan.

### [A Novel Under-Actuated Gripper Based on Passive-Locking Mechanism for Stable Gripping under Environmental Constraints]()

This paper presents a novel under-actuated two finger gripper that passively adapts to various environments and maintains its grip posture using a passive-locking mechanism. The proposed mechanism features fingers with three phalanges, each incorporating four-bar and eight-bar linkages arranged in parallel. These linkages perform crucial functions, including maintaining the grip angle and ensuring passive characteristics during pinch grips. Previous grippers with passive mechanisms and three-phalanx fingers faced issues with gripping instability, particularly when changes in the passive joint angle were caused by object inertia or external lateral forces. To address this problem, we propose a new passive-locking mechanism utilizing an eight-bar linkage. This innovative design is engineered to adapt to environmental conditions, establish a secure grip, and maintain the grip angle of the passive joint after the grip is achieved. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed mechanism, this paper conducts a fingertip force vector analysis and a mobility analysis according to the pinch sequence. It also details the derivation process and principles of the mechanism. The gripper’s operational range and gripping force are examined through kinematic analysis and verified by simulation. Furthermore, the study shows that the proposed mechanism effectively responds to environmental constraints, even in environments with obstacles surrounding the object. Comparative experiments with and without a contact bar indicate that the proposed gripper can stably secure an object in scenarios involving swing motions and external forces of approximately 5N.

### [Juzu Type Gripper That Can Change Both Shape and Firmness]()

This paper presents a novel gripper capable of actively changing both shape and firmness. The gripper increases its grasp ability by changing its finger posture and firmness suitable for given target objects. In the proposed gripper, each finger is constructed by serially connecting multiple Juzu units. By controlling the angles between neighboring Juzu units individually using two actuators used for sending and bending, arbitrary finger shapes can be generated. In addition, by controlling the tension of the wire that penetrated all Juzu units in each finger, the friction between Juzu units is adjusted and the firmness of finger can be varied. A prototype gripper was designed and developed, and experiments to evaluate the capabilities of changing shape and firmness were conducted. Furthermore, through experiments of preshaping and grasping for various objects with different shape and size, the validity of the proposed method was demonstrated.

### [Single-Motor-Driven (4 + 2)-Fingered Robotic Gripper Capable of Expanding the Workable Space in the Extremely Confined Environment]()

This study proposes a novel robotic gripper that can expand workable spaces in a target environment to pick up objects from confined spaces. The proposed gripper is most effective for retrieving objects from deformable environments, such as taking an object out of a drawstring bag, or for extracting target objects located behind surrounding objects. The proposed gripper achieves both work-space expansion and grasping motion by using only a single motor. The gripper is equipped with four outer fingers for expanding the environment and two inner fingers for grasping an object. The inner and outer fingers move in different directions for their respective functions of grasping and spatial expansion. To realize two different movements of the fingers, a novel self-motion switching mechanism that switches between the functions as feed-screw and rack-and-pinion mechanisms is developed. The mechanism switches the motions according to the magnitude of the force applied to the inner fingers. This paper presents the mechanism design of the developed gripper, including the self-motion switching mechanism and the actuation strategy for expanding the workable space. The mechanical analysis is also presented, and the analysis result is validated experimentally. Moreover, an automatic object-picking system using the developed gripper is constructed to evaluate the gripper.

### [Syn-Mediverse: A Multimodal Synthetic Dataset for Intelligent Scene Understanding of Healthcare Facilities]()

Safety and efficiency are paramount in healthcare facilities where the lives of patients are at stake. Despite the adoption of robots to assist medical staff in challenging tasks such as complex surgeries, human expertise is still indispensable. The next generation of autonomous healthcare robots hinges on their capacity to perceive and understand their complex and frenetic environments. While deep learning models are increasingly used for this purpose, they require extensive annotated training data which is impractical to obtain in real-world healthcare settings. To bridge this gap, we present Syn-Mediverse, the first hyper-realistic multimodal synthetic dataset of diverse healthcare facilities. Syn-Mediverse contains over 48,000 images from a simulated industry-standard optical tracking camera and provides more than 1.5M annotations spanning five different scene understanding tasks including depth estimation, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. We demonstrate the complexity of our dataset by evaluating the performance on a broad range of state- of-the-art baselines for each task. To further advance research on scene understanding of healthcare facilities, along with the public dataset we provide an online evaluation benchmark available at http://syn-mediverse.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [STEER: Flexible Robotic Manipulation Via Dense Language Grounding]()

The complexity of the real world demands robotic systems that can intelligently adapt to unseen situations. We present STEER, a robot learning framework that bridges high-level, commonsense reasoning with precise, flexible low-level control. Our approach translates complex situational awareness into actionable low-level behavior through training language-grounded policies with dense annotation. By structuring policy training around fundamental, modular manipulation skills expressed in natural language, STEER exposes an expressive interface for humans or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to intelligently orchestrate the robot's behavior by reasoning about the task and context. Our experiments demonstrate the skills learned via STEER can be combined to synthesize novel behaviors to adapt to new situations or perform completely new tasks without additional data collection or training.

### [MBE-ARI: A Multimodal Dataset Mapping Bi-Directional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction]()

Animal-robot interaction (ARI) remains an unexplored challenge in robotics, as robots struggle to interpret the complex, multimodal communication cues of animals, such as body language, movement, and vocalizations. Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals. The dataset and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/RISELabPurdue/MBE-ARI/, inviting further exploration and development in this critical area.

### [A Diffusion-Based Data Generator for Training Object Recognition Models in Ultra-Range Distance]()

Object recognition, commonly performed by a camera, is a fundamental requirement for robots to complete complex tasks. Some tasks require recognizing objects far from the robot's camera. A challenging example is Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) in human-robot interaction where the user exhibits directive gestures at a distance of up to 25~m from the robot. However, training a model to recognize hardly visible objects located in ultra-range requires an exhaustive collection of a significant amount of labeled samples. The generation of synthetic training datasets is a recent solution to the lack of real-world data, while unable to properly replicate the realistic visual characteristics of distant objects in images. In this letter, we propose the Diffusion in Ultra-Range (DUR) framework based on a Diffusion model to generate labeled images of distant objects in various scenes. The DUR generator receives a desired distance and class (e.g., gesture) and outputs a corresponding synthetic image. We apply DUR to train a URGR model with directive gestures in which fine details of the gesturing hand are challenging to distinguish. DUR is compared to other types of generative models showcasing superiority both in fidelity and in recognition success rate when training a URGR model. More importantly, training a DUR model on a limited amount of real data and then using it to generate synthetic data for training a URGR model outperforms directly training the URGR model on real data. The synthetic-based URGR model is also demonstrated in gesture-based direction of a ground robot.

### [MovingCables: Moving Cable Segmentation Method and Dataset]()

Manipulating cluttered cables, hoses or ropes is challenging for both robots and humans. Humans often simplify these perceptually challenging tasks by pulling or pushing tangled cables and observing the resulting motions. We propose to use a similar interactive perception principle to aid robotic cable manipulation. A fundamental building block of such an endeavor is a cable motion segmentation method that densely labels moving cable image pixels. This letter presents MovingCables, a moving cable dataset, which we hope will motivate the development and evaluation of cable motion segmentation algorithms. The dataset consists of real-world image sequences automatically annotated with ground truth segmentation masks and optical flow. In addition, we propose a cable motion segmentation method and evaluate its performance on the new dataset.

### [Dynamic Contact Force Estimation Via Integration of Soft Sensor Based on Fiber Bragg Grating and Series Elastic Actuator]()

Research on interactive force measurement in robotics follows two trends: distributed force sensing using soft tactile sensors and centered force sensing using rigid sensors. This study proposes a novel force sensing mechanism and algorithm to integrate the two approaches taking advantage of a soft tactile sensor and rigid actuator based on spring. Soft tactile sensors allow for gentle contact with humans, but have limited recovery and measurable force range. The rigidity of a spring-based actuator is utilized to address their force estimation issues. This allows for estimating a wider range of forces while maintaining the softness. The paper presents a novel approach for integrating two sensors using sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, a deep neural network is developed to estimate the contact location through the tactile sensor. Subsequently, a state-space observer is proposed based on the dynamic characteristics of the robot link, which integrates the network output and the torque measurements obtained from a spring-based actuator. This algorithm provides accurate force estimation during dynamic behavior and enables a wide measurable force range across the entire area of the robot link. The efficacy of the proposed mechanism and algorithm is validated through rigorous experimentation, demonstrating the fast recovery characteristics and accuracy.

### [A Piezoresistive Printable Strain Sensor for Monitoring and Control of Soft Robotic Links]()

Integrating sensors into soft links with complex geometries without compromising their flexibility, precision, or structural integrity remains one of the main challenges in soft robotics. This article presents the design, fabrication, and electromechanical evaluation of a 3D-printed flexible strain sensor tailored for monitoring and controlling these links. By combining Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Direct Ink Writing (DIW) technologies, we manufactured a sensor composed of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) substrate and a pattern of silver (Ag) nanoparticles ink, ensuring high flexibility and conductivity. We performed electromechanical tests to assess the sensor's performance, including three-point bending tests, cyclic loading to evaluate its durability, and angular deflection measurements to confirm its precision in detecting bending angles. The sensor demonstrated efficient piezoresistive behavior within a defined working range between 3% and 8% of flexure strain with a Gauge Factor (GF) of 0.24 and stable repeatability. We also tested its integration into a soft link, showing that the sensor maintains flexibility and accuracy during deformation.

### [AnySkin: Plug-And-Play Skin Sensing for Robotic Touch]()

While tactile sensing is widely accepted as an important and useful sensing modality, its use pales in comparison to other sensory modalities like vision and proprioception. AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede the use of tactile sensing -- versatility, replaceability, and data reusability. Building on the simplistic design of ReSkin, and decoupling the sensing electronics from the sensing interface, AnySkin simplifies integration making it as straightforward as putting on a phone case and connecting a charger. Furthermore, AnySkin is the first uncalibrated tactile-sensor with cross-instance generalizability of learned manipulation policies. To summarize, this work makes three key contributions: first, we introduce a streamlined fabrication process and a design tool for creating an adhesive-free, durable and easily replaceable magnetic tactile sensor; second, we characterize slip detection and policy learning with the AnySkin sensor; and third, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization of models trained on one instance of AnySkin to new instances, and compare it with popular existing tactile solutions like DIGIT and ReSkin. Code, design files, and videos of policy experiments can be found on https://any-skin.github.io

### [Proximity and Visuotactile Point Cloud Fusion for Contact Patches in Extreme Deformation]()

Visuotactile sensors are a popular tactile sensing strategy due to high-fidelity estimates of local object geometry. However, existing algorithms for processing raw sensor inputs to useful intermediate signals such as contact patches struggle in high-deformation regimes. This is due to physical constraints imposed by sensor hardware and small-deformation assumptions used by mechanics-based models. In this work, we propose a fusion algorithm for proximity and visuotactile point clouds for contact patch segmentation, entirely independent from membrane mechanics. This algorithm exploits the synchronous, high spatial resolution proximity and visuotactile modalities enabled by an extremely deformable, selectively transmissive soft membrane, which uses visible light for visuotactile sensing and infrared light for proximity depth. We evaluate our contact patch algorithm in low (10%), medium (60%), and high (100%+) strain states. We compare our method against three baselines: proximity-only, tactile-only, and a first principles mechanics model. Our approach outperforms all baselines with an average RMSE under 2.8 mm of the contact patch geometry across all strain ranges. We demonstrate our contact patch algorithm in four applications: varied stiffness membranes, torque and shear-induced wrinkling, closed loop control, and pose estimation.

### [Spatial Sensitivity Equalization of ERT-Based Robotic Skin through Gauge Factor Distribution Optimization]()

Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) has emerged as a promising technology for large-area robotic skin due to its ability to reconstruct pressure distribution over extensive regions using a few sparsely distributed electrodes. Despite ERT’s potential to reconstruct the external forces applied on 3D surfaces, the uneven distribution of spatial sensitivity leads to significant errors in identifying the physical quantities of contacts, inhibiting this technique from being an effective tactile sensor. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to equalize the spatial sensitivity by modulating the conductivity of ERT sensors through topology optimization. In a simulation environment, the sensor's conductive domain was converted into a binary image and optimized to equalize spatial sensitivity and reduce disparities between low and high-sensitivity areas. Additionally, we present a sensor fabrication method with a complex optimized conductive patch pattern from simulation by applying screen printing techniques. The effectiveness of the implemented spatial sensitivity equalization was validated by comparing it to a conventional ERT sensor in both simulations and real-world environments. The proposed sensitivity optimization method expands the use of ERT-based sensors for distributed tactile sensing in physical human-robot interaction scenarios.

### [Milli-Scale AcousTac Sensing Using Soft Helmholtz Resonators]()

Acoustic transmission, or sound, can effectively communicate information over distances through various media. We focus on generating acoustic transmission using pneumatically driven resonators for wireless tactile sensing without the need for any electronics at the end-effector or contact point. We explore the relationship between emitted frequency and the geometry of the resonance chamber. When a normal compressive force is applied to the end cap, the compliant resonant cavity deforms, leading to an increase in frequency measurable by an external microphone. Prior work uses tube resonators with fipple attachments. In the present work, we study whether a different smaller audible cylindrical resonator with air blown across the entryway can be utilized instead. We test the utility of the Helmholtz resonator model in predicting the experimental frequency response. Resonance is often modeled for rigid cavities, presenting unique challenges in predicting resonance for the design of soft resonating taxels.

### [Enhanced Model-Free Dynamic State Estimation for a Soft Robot Finger Using an Embedded Optical Waveguide Sensor]()

In this letter, an advanced stretchable optical waveguide sensor is implemented into a multidirectional PneuNet soft actuator to enhance dynamic state estimation through a NARX neural network. The stretchable waveguide featuring a semidivided core design from previous work is sensitive to multiple strain modes. It is integrated into a soft finger actuator with two pressure chambers that replicates human finger motions. The soft finger, designed for applications in soft robotic grippers or hands, is viewed in isolation under pneumatic actuation controlled by motorized linear stages. The research first characterizes the soft finger's workspace and sensor response. Subsequently, three dynamic state estimators are developed using NARX architecture, differing in the degree of incorporating the optical waveguide sensor response. Evaluation on a testing path reveals that the full sensor response significantly improves end effector position estimation, reducing mean error by 51% from 5.70 mm to 2.80 mm, compared to only 21% improvement to 4.53 mm using the estimator representing a single core waveguide design. The letter concludes by discussing the application of these estimators for (open-loop) model-predictive control and recommends future focus on advanced, structured soft (optical) sensors for model-free state estimation and control of soft robots.

### [Efficient and Diverse Generative Robot Designs Using Evolution and Intrinsic Motivation]()

Methods for generative design of robot physical configurations can automatically find optimal and innovative solutions for challenging tasks in complex environments. The vast search-space includes the physical design-space and the controller parameter-space, making it a challenging problem in machine learning and optimisation in general. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promising results in generating robot designs via gradient-free optimisation. Morpho-evolution with learning (MEL) uses EAs to concurrently generate robot designs and learn the optimal parameters of the controllers. Two main issues prevent MEL from scaling to higher complexity tasks: i) computational cost and ii) premature convergence to sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, we propose combining morpho-evolution with intrinsic motivations. Intrinsically motivated behaviour arises from embodiment and simple learning rules without external guidance. We use a homeokinetic controller that generates exploratory behaviour in a few seconds with minimal knowledge of the robot’s design. Homeokinesis replaces costly learning phases, reducing computational time and favouring diversity, preventing premature convergence. We compare our approach with current MEL methods in several downstream tasks. The generated designs score higher in all the tasks, are more diverse, and are quickly generated compared to morpho-evolution with static parameters.

### [A Novel Hybrid Hysteresis Modeling Method for Multiloop-Asymmetry Hysteresis Behavior of Nonlinear Compliant Actuators]()

Nonlinear compliant actuators are being increasingly used in human-robot interaction scenarios due to their inherent flexibility. However, a limitation is that nonlinear hysteresis exists, which will degrade the force/torque tracking performance if the hysteresis is not modeled accurately. Moreover, the existing methods are difficult to deal with the multi-loop asymmetry hysteresis. In this work, we present a novel modeling method, in which the hysteresis curves are decoupled into nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops. A hybrid hysteresis model based on power function and Maxwellslip model is then developed to fit the nonlinear reference lines and symmetrical hysteresis loops respectively. Experiments were conducted on a nonlinear compliant actuator and the results show that the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) of the hysteresis model decreases by 24.4% when compared with the Maxwellslip based hysteresis model.

### [Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Sonomyography and Electromyography for Predictive Modeling of Lower Limb Exoskeleton Walking]()

The nonlinear dynamics required to model walking with multi-joint lower limb exoskeleton assistance results in high computational burden. To address this, we derive a Koopman-based linearized model of the human-exoskeleton system using electromyography and ultrasound-derived metrics of volitional muscle activity during exoskeleton-assisted walking. Data are collected from one participant with spinal cord injury (SCI) and two participants with no disabilities. Various electromyography and ultrasound-derived features in addition to normalized motor currents are used to derive predictive models, and we identify which muscle activation metrics produce the most accurate model for each subject. For both subjects without disabilities, the most accurate model uses only ultrasound-derived echogenicity as a metric of muscle activity, while the most accurate model for the subject with SCI uses only EMG wave length. Furthermore, the inclusion of ground reaction force increases the prediction accuracy of all models for one participant with no disabilities while decreasing the accuracy of most models for the participant with SCI. For all subjects, the most accurate subject-specific linear model has a root-mean-square error (averaged across limb segment angles) of <8°.

### [Data-Driven Sampling Based Stochastic MPC for Skid-Steer Mobile Robot Navigation]()

Traditional approaches to motion modeling for skid-steer robots struggle to capture nonlinear tire-terrain dynamics, especially during high-speed maneuvers. In this paper, we tackle such nonlinearities by enhancing a dynamic unicycle model with Gaussian Process (GP) regression outputs. This enables us to develop an adaptive, uncertainty-informed navigation formulation. We solve the resultant stochastic optimal control problem using a chance-constrained Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control method. This approach formulates obstacle avoidance and path-following as chance constraints, accounting for residual uncertainties from the GP to ensure safety and reliability in control. Leveraging GPU acceleration, we efficiently manage the non-convex nature of the problem, ensuring real-time performance. Our approach unifies path-following and obstacle avoidance across different terrains, unlike prior works which typically focus on one or the other. We compare our GP-MPPI method against unicycle and data-driven kinematic models within the MPPI framework. In simulations, our approach shows superior tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance. We further validate our approach through hardware experiments on a skid-steer robot platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in high-speed navigation. The GPU implementation of the proposed method and supplementary video footage are available at https://stochasticmppi.github.io.

### [Agile Mobility with Rapid Online Adaptation Via Meta-Learning and Uncertainty-Aware MPPI]()

Modern non-linear model-based controllers require an accurate physics model and model parameters to be able to control mobile robots at their limits. Also, due to surface slipping at high speeds, the friction parameters may continually change (like tire degradation in autonomous racing), and the controller may need to adapt rapidly. Many works derive a task-specific robot model with a parameter adaptation scheme that works well for the task but requires a lot of effort and tuning for each platform and task. In this work, we design a full model-learning-based controller based on meta pre-training that can very quickly adapt using few-shot dynamics data to any wheel-based robot with any model parameters, while also reasoning about model uncertainty. We demonstrate our results in small-scale numeric simulation, the large-scale Unity simulator, and on a medium-scale hardware platform with a wide range of settings. We show that our results are comparable to domain-specific well-engineered controllers, and have excellent generalization performance across all scenarios

### [Variable Transmission Mechanisms for Robotic Applications: A Review]()

Actuators play a crucial role in robotics, determining the force and speed capabilities necessary for varied tasks, directly affecting the performance of the robotic system. With the growing reliance on robotics in both industrial applications and daily life, innovative actuator research has expanded significantly. Despite advances, traditional actuators encounter limitations in performance and operational range due to inherent physical constraints. To address these challenges, variable transmission mechanisms (VTMs) have emerged over the past decade as one of the alternative solutions, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of robotic systems. However, there is currently a lack of survey articles that comprehensively cover the mechanisms and working principles of VTMs in robotics. This review article fills this gap by offering an extensive analysis of VTM applications in robotics. It categorizes VTMs based on their mechanisms and principles, presents case studies on both commercial and experimental VTMs, and provides insights into future

### [Continuously Variable Transmission and Stiffness Actuator Based on Actively Variable Four-Bar Linkage for Highly Dynamic Robot Systems]()

This paper presents a novel actuation mechanism that combines a continuously variable transmission (CVT) mechanism with a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) for highly dynamic robot systems such as legged robots. The CVT effectively changes the input-output transmission ratio of the system, thereby extending the operational torque-speed range. Concurrently, the VSA adjusts the system stiffness, altering its compliance characteristics. Both CVT and VSA are seamlessly integrated into a single four-bar linkage mechanism, with their active features enabled by an actively variable link within this linkage. This CVT-VSA mechanism offers a range of dynamic advantages by inversely varying transmission ratio and stiffness, which includes impact mitigation, torque or speed amplification, and expanded control bandwidth. The implementation and efficacy of the CVT-VSA mechanism in a legged robot were tested and validated through a series of experiments.

### [A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction]()

The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.

### [RLPP: A Residual Method for Zero-Shot Real-World Autonomous Racing on Scaled Platforms]()

Autonomous racing presents a complex environment requiring robust controllers capable of making rapid decisions under dynamic conditions. While traditional controllers based on tire models are reliable, they often demand extensive tuning or system identification. RL methods offer significant potential due to their ability to learn directly from interaction, yet they typically suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulation fail to perform effectively in the real world. In this paper, we propose RLPP, a residual RL framework that enhances a PP controller with an RL-based residual. This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37%, closing the gap to the SotA methods by more than 52% and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller. The RLPP framework is made available as an open-source tool, encouraging further exploration and advancement in autonomous racing research. The code is available at: www.github.com/forzaeth/rlpp.

### [Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Risk Quantification of SOTIF for Autonomous Vehicles]()

Ensuring the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is critical. Effective risk assessment helps AVs make decisions and avoid risks. However, existing methods face challenges due to environmental uncertainties, insufficient multi-dimensional risk quantification, and limited predictive accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic risk assessment framework that quantifies the risk of AVs violating safety constraints and calculates the expected average severity of such violations in uncertain environments. We first establish a general SOTIF risk model to characterize the static risk of the AV and surrounding traffic participants. Following this, we introduce a method for predicting dynamic uncertainty risks, resulting in probabilistic risk quantification. This framework accounts for multi-dimensional uncertainties and enhances safety under dynamic conditions. Extensive evaluations across typical traffic scenarios—including highways, intersections, and roundabouts—demonstrate that our method outperforms typical algorithms like Time Headway (THW) and Time-to-Collision (TTC). Empirical studies in extreme scenarios further validate the framework's ability to reduce risks and improve system generalization. The related code is available at: https://github.com/idslab-autosec/risk_uncertainty.

### [Think Deep and Fast: Learning Neural Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics from Inverse Dynamic Games for Split-Second Interactions]()

Non-cooperative interactions commonly occur in multi-agent scenarios such as car racing, where an ego vehicle can choose to overtake the rival, or stay behind it until a safe overtaking “corridor” opens. While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, autonomous agents are incapable of rapidly reasoning about complex, potentially conflicting options, leading to suboptimal behaviors such as deadlocks. Recently, the nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) model has proven to exhibit fast opinion formation and avoidance of decision deadlocks. However, NOD modeling parameters are oftentimes assumed fixed, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments. It remains an open challenge to determine such parameters automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based and game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. We demonstrate Neural NOD’s ability to make fast and deadlock-free decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example. We find that Neural NOD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art data-driven inverse game baseline in terms of safety and overtaking performance.

### [Online Risk-Bounded Graph-Based Local Planning for Autonomous Driving with Theoretical Guarantees]()

Risk-bounded motion planning in dynamic environments for autonomous driving presents complex challenges, particularly in solving the nonconvex problem of ensuring continuous, safe, and real-time navigation towards a destination. This paper introduces an online graph-based local planning approach constrained by a user-defined driving style in terms of a risk budget Delta for the entire mission. Our online approach assigns a risk bound to each motion planning decision, ensuring that the total risk consumed remains within Delta. First, we construct a spatial lattice graph that adheres to the vehicle's curvature constraints. Then, the trajectory planning problem is reformulated as an online optimization problem, where decisions must be made sequentially without prior knowledge of future events. Therefore, we propose a reduction to the problem to be online multiple-choice knapsack problem (ON-MCKP), where the knapsack items are candidate paths generated by solving constrained shortest-path problems. To solve the ON-MCKP, we deploy online algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees on the risk allocation throughout the entire mission. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated empirically, showing significant improvements in the objective without violating safety constraints.

### [Dashing for the Golden Snitch: Multi-Drone Time-Optimal Motion Planning with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning]()

Recent innovations in autonomous drones have facilitated time-optimal flight in single-drone configurations, and enhanced maneuverability in multi-drone systems by applying optimal control and learning-based methods. However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network using multi-agent reinforcement learning for time-optimal multi-drone flight. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision-free mechanism inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance trade-offs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with a low collision rate. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as in simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m × 5.5 m × 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation.

### [Kernel-Based Metrics Learning for Uncertain Opponent Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Racing]()

Autonomous racing confronts significant challenges in safely overtaking Opponent Vehicles (OVs) that exhibit uncertain trajectories, stemming from unknown driving policies. To address these challenges, this study proposes heterogeneous kernel metrics for Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), designed to robustly capture the diverse driving policies of OVs, and carry out precise trajectory predictions along with the associated uncertainties. A key virtue of the proposed kernel metrics lies in their ability to align similar driving policies and disjoin dissimilar ones in an unsupervised manner, given the observed interactions between the Ego Vehicle (EV) and OVs. The efficacy of the proposed method is substantiated through experimental studies on a 1/10th scale racecar platform, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and thereby safely overtaking against OVs. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient for onboard computing units, affirming its viability in fast-paced racing environments.

### [Inferring Occluded Agent Behavior in Dynamic Games from Noise Corrupted Observations]()

In mobile robotics and autonomous driving, it is natural to model agent interactions as the Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative, dynamic game. These methods inherently rely on observations from sensors such as lidars and cameras to identify agents participating in the game and, therefore, have difficulty when some agents are occluded. To address this limitation, this paper presents an occlusion-aware game-theoretic inference method to estimate the locations of potentially occluded agents, and simultaneously infer the intentions of both visible and occluded agents, which best accounts for the observations of visible agents. Additionally, we propose a receding horizon planning strategy based on an occlusion-aware contingency game designed to navigate in scenarios with potentially occluded agents. Monte Carlo simulations validate our approach, demonstrating that it accurately estimates the game model and trajectories for both visible and occluded agents using noisy observations of visible agents. Our planning pipeline significantly enhances navigation safety when compared to occlusion-ignorant baseline as well.

### [Domain Randomization for Object Detection in Manufacturing Applications Using Synthetic Data: A Comprehensive Study]()

This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods, post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases, respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain randomization, potentially covering the distribution close to real data for the applications.

### [Component-Aware Unsupervised Logical Anomaly Generation for Industrial Anomaly Detection]()

Anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing for ensuring product quality and improving efficiency in automated processes. The scarcity of anomalous samples limits traditional detection methods, making anomaly generation essential for expanding the data repository. However, recent generative models often produce unrealistic anomalies increasing false positives, or require real-world anomaly samples for training. In this work, we treat anomaly generation as a compositional problem and propose ComGEN, a component-aware and unsupervised framework that addresses the gap in logical anomaly generation. Our method comprises a multi-component learning strategy to disentangle visual components, followed by subsequent generation editing procedures. Disentangled text-to-component pairs, revealing intrinsic logical constraints, conduct attention-guided residual mapping and model training with iteratively matched references across multiple scales. Experiments on the MVTecLOCO dataset confirm the efficacy of ComGEN, achieving the best AUROC score of 91.2%. Additional experiments on the real-world scenario of Diesel Engine and widely-used MVTecAD dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements when integrating simulated anomalies generated by ComGEN into automated production workflows.

### [Use the Force, Bot! - Force-Aware ProDMP with Event-Based Replanning]()

Movement Primitives (MPs) are a well-established method for representing and generating modular robot trajectories. This work presents FA-ProDMP, a novel approach that introduces force awareness to Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMP). FA-ProDMP adapts trajectories during runtime to account for measured and desired forces, offering smooth trajectories and capturing position and force correlations across multiple demonstrations. FA-ProDMPs support multiple axes of force, making them agnostic to Cartesian or joint space control. This versatility makes FA-ProDMP a valuable tool for learning contact rich manipulation tasks, such power plug insertion. To reliably evaluate FA-ProDMP, this work additionally introduces a modular, 3D printed task suite called POEMPEL, inspired by the popular Lego Technic pins. POEMPEL mimics industrial peg-in-hole assembly tasks with force requirements and offers multiple parameters of adjustment, such as position, orientation and plug stiffness level, thereby varying the direction and amount of required forces. Our experiments demonstrate that FA-ProDMP outperforms other MP formulations on the POEMPEL setup and a electrical power plug insertion task, thanks to its replanning capabilities based on measured forces. These findings highlight how FA-ProDMP enhances the performance of robotic systems in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

### [Reinforcement Learning on Reconfigurable Hardware: Overcoming Material Variability in Laser Material Processing]()

Ensuring consistent processing quality is challenging in laser processes due to varying material properties and surface conditions. Although some approaches have shown promise in solving this problem via automation, they often rely on predetermined targets or are limited to simulated environments. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel real-time reinforcement learning approach for laser process control, implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array to achieve real-time execution. Our experimental results from laser welding tests on stainless steel samples with a range of surface roughnesses validated the method's ability to adapt autonomously, without relying on reward engineering or prior setup information. Specifically, the algorithm learned the optimal power profile for each unique surface characteristic, demonstrating significant improvements over hand-engineered optimal constant power strategies — up to 23% better performance on rougher surfaces and 7% on mixed surfaces. This approach represents a significant advancement in automating and optimizing laser processes, with potential applications across multiple industries.

### [GenCo: A Dual LVLM Generate-Correct Framework for Adaptive Peg-In-Hole Robotics]()

Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced their application in robotics, encompassing both high-level task planning and low-level action control. Despite their strong performance across various robotic tasks, even for zero-shot scenarios, most VLM applications remain open-loop, adhering to a plan-and-execute paradigm without mechanisms to assess task completion. To address this limitation, we propose GenCo, a Generate-Correct framework designed to automate a peg-in-hole task using a UR5e robot. This framework integrates an VLM-based motion generator and motion expert, working collaboratively to refine and correct actions during robotic task execution. Both VLM agents are fine-tuned using the pre-trained LLaVA, enhancing adaptability and scaling efficiently to diverse tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the adaptiveness of the framework, improving the success rate for the peg-in-hole task by 12.75% compared to a single VLM open-loop method. Notably, in unseen scenarios, the success rate for a triangular peg was increased by 15%, and for a random-shaped peg by 17%, underscoring the system's effectiveness in handling novel tasks. Adaptive testing under varied camera positions demonstrated robust performance, affirming reliability despite shifts in the visual input. The framework is also designed to be lightweight and efficient, facilitating broader adoption and practical deployment.

### [ASCENT: Autonomous Skill Learning Toward Complex Embodied Tasks with Foundation Models]()

Collecting data from simulated scenarios for training robotic skills provides a safer and more controllable alternative to real-world environments. However, it demands considerable effort, including the manual construction of simulation environments, the careful design of tasks, and the challenge of obtaining effective trajectories. These limitations hinder the efficiency of data collection from simulated scenarios. In this paper, we leverage the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to generate simulated scenarios and embodied tasks. We introduce a novel framework, ASCENT (Autonomous Skill learning toward Complex Embodied tasks with fouNdaTion models), designed to efficiently accomplish these tasks and generate trajectory data. ASCENT features a fully autonomous skill learning mechanism based on AI agent. During task training, the AI agent identifies suitable atomic skills from an atomic skill library to either directly complete the task or serve as an initial policy for further training. Newly acquired atomic skills are subsequently added to the library. To address training failures and enhance efficiency, the AI agent uses an LLM to automatically optimize the skill training process based on feedback received from simulations. Experimental results indicate that the number of training steps required for learning new tasks can be reduced by up to 65.9%.

### [Ms. NAMI: Multimodal Semantic Navigation on Relative Metric Intention Graph]()

Embodied navigation in unknown environments presents the significant challenge of integrating tasks with multimodal goals into a unified framework. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Semantic Navigation on Relative Metric Intention Graph (Ms. NAMI), a framework that integrates various navigation tasks with multimodal goals based on a relative topo-metric intention graph. A reinforcement learning based policy with a concise action space, consisting of frontier nodes and intention nodes, is designed to guide the agent to select reasonable sub-goals. A sparse reward design is introduced to reduce bias during training. Additionally, several engineering optimizations are implemented to enhance overall performance. The experimental results indicate that our method can achieve robust navigation performance in a variety of unknown environments.

### [Towards Autonomous Crop Monitoring: Inserting Sensors in Cluttered Environments]()

Monitoring crop nutrients can aid farmers in optimizing fertilizer use. Many existing robots rely on visionbased phenotyping, however, which can only indirectly estimate nutrient deficiencies once crops have undergone visible color changes. We present a contact-based phenotyping robot platform that can directly insert nitrate sensors into cornstalks to proactively monitor macronutrient levels in crops. This task is challenging because inserting such sensors requires subcentimeter precision in an environment which contains high levels of clutter, lighting variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, we develop a robust perception-action pipeline to grasp stalks, and create a custom robot gripper which mechanically aligns the sensor before inserting it into the stalk. Through experimental validation on 48 unique stalks in a cornfield in Iowa, we demonstrate our platform’s capability of detecting a stalk with 94% success, grasping a stalk with 90% success, and inserting a sensor with 60% success. In addition to developing an autonomous phenotyping research platform, we share key challenges and insights obtained from deployment in the field. Our research platform is open-sourced, with additional information available at https://kantor-lab.github.io/cornbot.

### [A Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics]()

As the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation of shape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.

### [A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics]()

In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionally, path-following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle’s center along a predefined trajectory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the tool itself rather than the vehicle’s center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially intended for the rear axle’s midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset point control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.

### [Towards Over-Canopy Autonomous Navigation: Crop-Agnostic LiDAR-Based Crop-Row Detection in Arable Fields]()

Autonomous navigation is crucial for various robotics applications in agriculture. However, many existing methods depend on RTK-GPS devices, which can be susceptible to loss of radio signal or intermittent reception of corrections from the internet. Consequently, research has increasingly focused on using RGB cameras for crop-row detection, though challenges persist when dealing with grown plants. This paper introduces a LiDAR-based navigation system that can achieve crop-agnostic over-canopy autonomous navigation in row-crop fields, even when the canopy fully blocks the inter-row spacing. Our algorithm can detect crop rows across diverse scenarios, encompassing various crop types, growth stages, illumination conditions, the presence of weeds, curved rows, and discontinuities. Without utilizing a global localization method (i.e., based on GPS), our navigation system can perform autonomous navigation in these challenging scenarios, detect the end of the crop rows, and navigate to the next crop row autonomously, providing a crop-agnostic approach to navigate an entire field. The proposed navigation system has undergone tests in various simulated and real agricultural fields, achieving an average cross-track error of 3.55 cm without human intervention. The system has been deployed on a customized UGV robot, which can be reconfigured depending on the field conditions.

### [Safe Leaf Manipulation for Accurate Shape and Pose Estimation of Occluded Fruits]()

Fruit monitoring plays an important role in crop management, and rising global fruit consumption combined with labor shortages necessitates automated monitoring with robots. However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

### [Autonomous Sensor Exchange and Calibration for Cornstalk Nitrate Monitoring Robot]()

Interactive sensors are an important component of robotic systems but often require manual replacement due to wear and tear. Automating this process can enhance system autonomy and facilitate long-term deployment. We developed an autonomous sensor exchange and calibration system for an agriculture crop monitoring robot that inserts a nitrate sensor into cornstalks. A novel gripper and replacement mechanism, featuring a reliable funneling design, were developed to enable efficient and reliable sensor exchanges. To maintain consistent nitrate sensor measurement, an on-board sensor calibration station was integrated to provide in-field sensor cleaning and calibration. The system was deployed at the Ames Curtis Farm in June 2024, where it successfully inserted nitrate sensors with high accuracy into 30 cornstalks with a 77% success rate.

### [Enhancing Agricultural Environment Perception Via Active Vision and Zero-Shot Learning]()

Agriculture, fundamental for human sustenance, faces unprecedented challenges. The need for efficient, human-cooperative, and sustainable farming methods has never been greater. The core contributions of this work involve leveraging Active Vision (AV) techniques and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) to improve the robot's ability to perceive and interact with agricultural environment in the context of fruit harvesting. The AV Pipeline implemented within ROS 2 integrates the Next-Best View (NBV) Planning for 3D environment reconstruction through a dynamic 3D Occupancy Map. Our system allows the robotics arm to dynamically plan and move to the most informative viewpoints and explore the environment, updating the 3D reconstruction using semantic information produced through ZSL models. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate our system's effectiveness in complex visibility conditions, outperforming traditional and static predefined planning methods. ZSL segmentation models employed, such as YOLO World + EfficientViT SAM, exhibit high-speed performance and accurate segmentation, allowing flexibility when dealing with semantic information in unknown agricultural contexts without requiring any fine-tuning process.

### [CitDet: A Benchmark Dataset for Citrus Fruit Detection]()

In this letter, we present a new dataset to advance the state of the art in detecting citrus fruit and accurately estimate yield on trees affected by the Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in orchard environments via imaging. Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations.

### [Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner: Attention-Guided Sampling for State-Specific Decision Making]()

Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms are renowned for their robust global search capabilities. However, the inherent randomness in their sampling mechanisms often results in inconsistent path quality and limited search efficiency. In response to these challenges, this work proposes a novel deep learning-based motion planning framework, named Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner (TEMP), which synergizes a Co-Regulation Environmental Information Encoder (CEIE) with a Motion Planning Transformer (MPT). CEIE converts scenario data into encoded environmental information (EEI), providing MPT with an insightful understanding of the environment. MPT leverages an attention mechanism to dynamically recalibrate its focus on EEI, task objectives, and historical planning data, refining the sampling node generation. To demonstrate the capabilities of TEMP, we train our model using a dataset consisting of planning results produced by RRT*. CEIE and MPT are collaboratively trained, enabling CEIE to autonomously learn and extract patterns from environmental data, thereby forming informative representations that MPT can more effectively interpret and utilize for motion planning. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate TEMP's efficacy across diverse dimensions and assess it in out-of-distribution real-world scenarios, demonstrating that TEMP achieves exceptional performance metrics and a heightened degree of generalizability compared to state-of-the-art SBMPs.

### [From Configuration-Space Clearance to Feature-Space Margin: Sample Complexity in Learning-Based Collision Detection]()

Motion planning is a central challenge in robotics, with learning-based approaches gaining significant attention in recent years. Our work focuses on a specific aspect of these approaches: using machine-learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate whether robot configurations are collision free, an operation termed “collision detection”. Despite the growing popularity of these methods, there is a lack of theory supporting their efficiency and prediction accuracy. This is in stark contrast to the rich theoretical results of machine-learning methods in general and of SVMs in particular. Our work bridges this gap by analyzing the sample complexity of an SVM classifier for learning-based collision detection in motion planning. We bound the number of samples needed to achieve a specified accuracy at a given confidence level. This result is stated in terms relevant to robot motion planning such as the system’s clearance. Building on these theoretical results, we propose a collision-detection algorithm that can also provide statistical guarantees on the algorithm’s error in classifying robot configurations as collision-free or not.

### [CTSAC: Curriculum-Based Transformer Soft Actor-Critic for Goal-Oriented Robot Exploration]()

With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.

### [Guiding Long-Horizon Task and Motion Planning with Vision Language Models]()

Vision-Language Models (VLM) can generate plausible high-level plans when prompted with a goal, the context, an image of the scene, and any planning constraints. However, there is no guarantee that the predicted actions are geometrically and kinematically feasible for a particular robot embodiment. As a result, many prerequisite steps such as opening drawers to access objects are often omitted. Task and motion planners can generate motion trajectories that respect the geometric feasibility of actions and insert physically necessary actions, but do not scale to everyday problems that require common-sense knowledge and involve large state spaces comprised of many variables. We leverage the VLM for 1) system dynamics (i.e. recipe) and 2) search help. We propose VLM-TAMP, a hierarchical planning algorithm that leverages a VLM to generate intermediate subgoals that guide the sampling of a task and motion planner. When a subgoal or action cannot be refined, the VLM is queried again for replanning. We evaluate VLM-TAMP on kitchen tasks where a robot must accomplish cooking goals that require performing 30-50 actions in sequence and interacting with up to 21 objects. We found that VLM-TAMP substantially outperforms baselines that rigidly and independently execute VLM-generated action sequences (success rate 50 to 100% versus 0%, average task completion percentage 72 to 100% versus 15 to 45%). See the project site https://zt-yang.github.io/vlm-tamp-robot/ for more information.

### [CrowdSurfer: Sampling Optimization Augmented with Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder for Dense Crowd Navigation]()

Navigation amongst densely packed crowds remains a challenge for mobile robots. The complexity increases further if the environment layout changes, making the prior computed global plan infeasible. In this paper, we show that it is possible to dramatically enhance crowd navigation by just improving the local planner. Our approach combines generative modelling with inference time optimization to generate sophisticated long-horizon local plans at interactive rates. More specifically, we train a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder to learn a prior over the expert trajectory distribution conditioned on the perception input. At run-time, this is used as an initialization for a sampling-based optimizer for further refinement. Our approach does not require any sophisticated prediction of dynamic obstacles and yet provides state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we compare against the recent DRL-VO approach and show a 40% improvement in success rate and a 6% improvement in travel time.

### [CLIMB: Language-Guided Continual Learning for Task Planning with Iterative Model Building]()

Intelligent and reliable task planning is a core capability for generalized robotics, which requires a descriptive domain representation that sufficiently models all object and state information for the scene. We present CLIMB, a continual learning framework for robot task planning that leverages foundation models and feedback from execution to guide the construction of domain models. CLIMB can build a model from a natural language description, learn non-obvious predicates while solving tasks, and store that information for future problems. We demonstrate the ability of CLIMB to improve performance in common planning environments compared to baseline methods. We also developed the BlocksWorld++ domain, a simulated environment with an easily usable real counterpart, together with a curriculum of tasks with progressing difficulty to evaluate continual learning.

### [Safe Multi-Agent Navigation Guided by Goal-Conditioned Safe Reinforcement Learning]()

Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous environments. Traditional planning methods are effective for solving long-horizon tasks but depend on the availability of a graph representation with predefined distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) is capable of learning complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent then executes by following those waypoints sequentially until their goal locations are reached. This graph pruning and planning approach via the learned value functions allows our approach to flexibly balance the trade-off between faster and safer routes especially over extended horizons.Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level safe GCRL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safer navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents. Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments.

### [Motion Planning for 2-DOF Transformable Wheel Robots Using Reinforcement Learning]()

Transformable robots have been developed to perform various tasks using flexible methods. However, the transformation properties present challenges in controlling and planning motion strategies, as the system model changes when transformations occur. To address this issue, we propose a planning framework based on artificial intelligence, called Geometric Manipulability Reinforcement Learning (GM-RL). GM-RL consists of two components: the manipulability estimator and the motion planner. The manipulability estimator employs graph neural networks (GNN) to provide action guidelines based on the dynamic manipulability of the transformable robots. The motion planner generates transformation plans using reinforcement learning (RL). The activation ratio alpha adjusts the ratio of the guideline accepted between the two components. In experiments utilizing a 2-DoF transformable wheel called STEP, GM-RL with alpha=0.5 generated an optimal transformation plan with an average dynamic manipulability measure of 0.0424, the highest measure compared to pure dynamic manipulability and reinforcement learning. A real-world experiment demonstrated that the transformation plan is efficient for overcoming stairs.

### [Towards Effective Utilization of Mixed-Quality Demonstrations in Robotic Manipulation Via Segment-Level Selection and Optimization]()

Data is crucial for robotic manipulation, as it underpins the development of robotic systems for complex tasks. While high-quality, diverse datasets enhance the performance and adaptability of robotic manipulation policies, collecting extensive expert-level data is resource-intensive. Consequently, many current datasets suffer from quality inconsistencies due to operator variability, highlighting the need for methods to utilize mixed-quality data effectively. To mitigate these issues, we propose "Select Segments to Imitate" (S2I), a framework that selects and optimizes mixed-quality demonstration data at the segment level, while ensuring plug-and-play compatibility with existing robotic manipulation policies. The framework has three components: demonstration segmentation dividing origin data into meaningful segments, segment selection using contrastive learning to find high-quality segments, and trajectory optimization to refine suboptimal segments for better policy learning. We evaluate S2I through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments across six tasks, demonstrating that with only 3 expert demonstrations for reference, S2I can improve the performance of various downstream policies when trained with mixed-quality demonstrations.

### [DABI: Evaluation of Data Augmentation Methods Using Downsampling in Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning with Images]()

Autonomous robot manipulation is a complex and continuously evolving robotics field. This paper focuses on data augmentation methods in imitation learning. Imitation learning consists of three stages: data collection from experts, learning model, and execution. However, collecting expert data requires manual effort and is time-consuming. Additionally, as sensors have different data acquisition intervals, preprocessing such as downsampling to match the lowest frequency is necessary. Downsampling enables data augmentation and also contributes to the stabilization of robot operations. In light of this background, this paper proposes the Data Augmentation Method for Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning with Images, called "DABI". DABI collects robot joint angles, velocities, and torques at 1000 Hz, and uses images from gripper and environmental cameras captured at 100 Hz as the basis for data augmentation. This enables a tenfold increase in data. In this paper, we collected just 5 expert demonstration datasets. We trained the bilateral control Bi-ACT model with the unaltered dataset and two augmentation methods for comparative experiments and conducted real-world experiments. The results confirmed a significant improvement in success rates, thereby proving the effectiveness of DABI. For additional material, please check:https://mertcookimg.github.io/dabi

### [Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations with Self-Supervision for Robotic Manipulation]()

Improving data utilization, especially for imperfect data from task failures, is crucial for robotic manipulation due to the challenging, time-consuming, and expensive data collection process in the real world. Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.

### [MATCH POLICY: A Simple Pipeline from Point Cloud Registration to Manipulation Policies]()

Many manipulation tasks require the robot to rearrange objects relative to one another. Such tasks can be described as a sequence of relative poses between parts of a set of rigid bodies. In this work, we propose Match Policy, a simple but novel pipeline for solving high-precision pick and place tasks. Instead of predicting actions directly, our method registers the pick and place targets to the stored demonstrations. This transfers action inference into a point cloud registration task and enables us to realize nontrivial manipulation policies without any training. Match Policy is designed to solve high-precision tasks with a key-frame setting. By leveraging the geometric interaction and the symmetries of the task, it achieves extremely high sample efficiency and generalizability to unseen configurations. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on RLbench benchmark compared with several strong baselines and test it on a real robot with six tasks.

### [Self-Improving Autonomous Underwater Manipulation]()

Underwater robotic manipulation faces significant challenges due to complex fluid dynamics and unstructured environments, causing most manipulation systems to rely heavily on human teleoperation. In this paper, we introduce AquaBot, a fully autonomous manipulation system that combines behavior cloning from human demonstrations with self-learning optimization to improve beyond human teleoperation performance. With extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate AquaBot's versatility across diverse manipulation tasks, including object grasping, trash sorting, and rescue retrieval. Our real-world experiments show that AquaBot's self-optimized policy outperforms a human operator by 41% in speed. AquaBot represents a promising step towards autonomous and self-improving underwater manipulation systems.

### [DexMimicGen: Automated Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation Via Imitation Learning]()

Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the high costs and human efforts involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the difficulty of simultaneously controlling the two arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for training data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for bimanual robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task. Generated datasets, simulation environments and additional results are at dexmimicgen.github.io.

### [The Art of Imitation: Learning Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks from Few Demonstrations]()

Task Parametrized Gaussian Mixture Models (TP-GMM) are a sample-efficient method for learning object-centric robot manipulation tasks. However, there are several open challenges to applying TP-GMMs in the wild. In this work, we tackle three crucial challenges synergistically. First, end-effector velocities are non-Euclidean and thus hard to model using standard GMMs. We thus propose to factorize the robot's end-effector velocity into its direction and magnitude, and model them using Riemannian GMMs. Second, we leverage the factorized velocities to segment and sequence skills from complex demonstration trajectories. Through the segmentation, we further align skill trajectories and hence leverage time as a powerful inductive bias. Third, we present a method to automatically detect relevant task parameters per skill from visual observations. Our approach enables learning complex manipulation tasks from just five demonstrations while using only RGB-D observations. Extensive experimental evaluations on RLBench demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with 20-fold improved sample efficiency. Our policies generalize across different environments, object instances, and object positions, while the learned skills are reusable.

### [ZeroMimic: Distilling Robotic Manipulation Skills from Web Videos]()

Many recent advances in robotic manipulation have come through imitation learning, yet these rely largely on mimicking a particularly hard-to-acquire form of demonstrations: those collected on the same robot in the same room with the same objects as the trained policy must handle at test time. In contrast, large pre-recorded human video datasets demonstrating manipulation skills in-the-wild already exist, which contain valuable information for robots. Is it possible to distill a repository of useful robotic skill policies out of such data without any additional requirements on robot-specific demonstrations or exploration? We present the first such system ZeroMimic, that generates immediately deployable image goal-conditioned skill policies for several common categories of manipulation tasks (opening, closing, pouring, pick&place, cutting, and stirring) each capable of acting upon diverse objects and across diverse unseen task setups. ZeroMimic is carefully designed to exploit recent advances in semantic and geometric visual understanding of human videos, together with modern grasp affordance detectors and imitation policy classes. After training ZeroMimic on the popular EpicKitchens dataset of ego-centric human videos, we evaluate its out-of-the-box performance in varied real-world and simulated kitchen settings with two different robot embodiments, demonstrating its impressive abilities to handle these varied tasks. To enable plug-and-play reuse of ZeroMimic policies on other task setups and robots, we release software and policy checkpoints of our skill policies.

### [Object Importance Estimation Using Counterfactual Reasoning for Intelligent Driving]()

The ability to identify important objects in a complex and dynamic driving environment is essential for autonomous driving agents to make safe and efficient driving decisions. It also helps assistive driving systems decide when to alert drivers. We tackle object importance estimation in a data-driven fashion and introduce HOIST -Human-annotated Object Importance in Simulated Traffic. HOIST contains driving scenarios with human-annotated importance labels for vehicles and pedestrians. We additionally propose a novel approach that relies on counterfactual reasoning to estimate an object's importance. We generate counterfactual scenarios by modifying the motion of objects and ascribe importance based on how the modifications affect the ego vehicle's driving. Our approach outperforms strong baselines for the task of object importance estimation on HOIST. We also perform ablation studies to justify our design choices and show the significance of the different components of our proposed approach.

### [3D Multi-Modal Object Detection Based on Cross-Attention Feature Fusion]()

In Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), environmental perception and object detection are crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. Single-modality systems often struggle under adverse weather conditions, underscoring the need for multi-modal approaches. Current fusion methods typically rely on simplistic concatenation of multi-modal fea-tures, which neglects semantic alignment and does not fully exploit inter-modal correlations. This paper proposes a cross-attention feature fusion specifically designed to enhance the global correlation between camera and radar features. By dynamically adjusting feature weights through cross-attention, our approach significantly improves feature integration. Fur-thermore, we propose a depth-weighted voting fusion strategy to select the most accurate sensor depth, thereby enhancing decision-making stability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show substantial improvements, with mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.399 and mean Average Translation Error (mATE) of 0.602, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of multi-modal fusion.

### [Multi-Modality Test-Time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation in Robotic Perception]()

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) adjusts pre-trained models among unlabeled unseen environments during the test phase, making it more practical for robotic applications. However, the constant changes of the physical world create significant domain gaps between the received data during robot deployment and the source data used for training. In addition, existing methods mainly focus on a single modality, {e.g.}, RGB images, limiting the application of these methods in multi-modality input scenarios. In this work, we propose a Deep Multi-modality Aggregation Test-time Adaptation (DMATA) method to address the above mentioned issues. To prevent the domain shifts from disrupting the adaptation process, we first propose a Momentum-based Teacher-Student (MTS) framework. Since the teacher model and the student model contain complementary information, we design an Uncertainty-Guide (UG) feature fusion block to fuse the teacher model and student model of each modality. Finally, we introduce a 3D-Guide-2D (3G2) feature fusion block to extract spatial information from RGB images. In this way, 2D feature extraction is enhanced.

### [4DRadDet: Cluster-Queried Enhanced 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar]()

3D object detection plays a critical role in advancing autonomous driving technology. To improve perception capabilities while maintaining low costs and ensuring performance in adverse weather conditions, 4D radar has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D object detection. However, current methods fail to fully exploit raw data and density information of 4D radar point clouds to tackle challenges like sparse data and noise. To address these limitations and make use of the unique Doppler velocity information provided by 4D radar, we propose a novel approach called 4DRadDet, which uses cross-attention fusion with cluster-queried techniques for 3D object detection. The 4DRadDet model uses a specially designed incremental clustering method to cluster potential object point clouds, reducing measurement errors from limited radar angular resolution and signal multipath effects. The cross-attention feature fusion (CAFF) module enhances network performance by querying the clustered point cloud feature map, allowing the network to leverage reliable prior information from the clustered point cloud to better detect potential objects. Our experimental evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of 4DRadDet, showcasing state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, 4DRadDet achieves a 3D mean average precision (mAP3D) of 51.44% and a bird's-eye view mean average precision (mAPBEV) of 57.07%. Our proposed method demonstrates impressive inference times and achieves real-time detection capabilities.

### [Robust Visual Localization System with HD Map Based on Joint Probabilistic Data Association]()

Localization based on a high-definition (HD) map is a pivotal technology for autonomous driving. Nonetheless, establishing precise data association (DA) between detected landmarks and map landmarks presents a formidable challenge when leveraging prior information on maps. Traditional DA algorithms relying on nearest-neighbor methods only partially mitigate the ambiguity in DA caused by missed or false detections from the perception module, especially in complex and challenging environments. In this letter, we propose a novel joint probability data association (JPDA) algorithm. By integrating joint probability encompassing semantic likelihood, local spatial likelihood, and global structural likelihood of landmarks, alongside incorporating inter-frame temporal continuity of DA, the proposed algorithm can effectively rectify the erroneous DA. Additionally, we also introduce a max-mixture factor graph optimization framework, which couples the measurements of landmarks and odometry for pose estimation. Building upon these methods, a high-precision and robust visual semantic localization system employing consumer-level sensors has been developed. Experiments conducted on public datasets and real urban roads validate the efficacy of the proposed system in providing more robust and accurate localization results for autonomous driving vehicles.

### [SALON: Self-Supervised Adaptive Learning for Off-Road Navigation]()

Autonomous robot navigation in off-road environments presents a number of challenges due to its lack of structure, making it difficult to handcraft robust heuristics for diverse scenarios. While learned methods using hand labels or self-supervised data improve generalizability, they often require a tremendous amount of data and can be vulnerable to domain shifts. To improve generalization in novel environments, recent works have incorporated adaptation and self-supervision to develop autonomous systems that can learn from their own experiences online. However, current works often rely on significant prior data, for example minutes of human teleoperation data for each terrain type, which is difficult to scale with more environments and robots. To address these limitations, we propose SALON, a perception-action framework for textit{fast} adaptation of traversability estimates with textit{minimal} human input. SALON rapidly learns online from experience while avoiding out of distribution terrains to produce adaptive and risk-aware cost and speed maps. Within textit{seconds} of collected experience, our results demonstrate comparable navigation performance over kilometer-scale courses in diverse off-road terrain as methods trained on 100-1000x more data. We additionally show promising results on significantly different robots in different environments. Our code is available at https://theairlab.org/SALON.

### [MDC-Seg: Multi-Directional Convolution-Based Semantic Segmentation for LiDAR Point Clouds]()

LiDAR point clouds 3D semantic segmentation enables efficient and accurate environmental sensing for intelligent vehicles and autonomous robots, greatly advancing these domains. Existing advanced methods use 3D sparse convolutional often suffer from a small Effective Receptive Field (ERF), limiting context sensing and challenging high-performance segmentation. Building on this observation, we propose MDC-Seg for efficient ERF enlargement. We design Multi-directional Convolution (MDConv), which simultaneously performs sparse feature encoding on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Range View (RV) planes to enlarge the ERF of 3D sparse convolution. To enhance feature fusion in MDConv, we introduce an attention mechanism and design an efficient multi-feature fusion (EMFF) module suitable for both 3D and 2D sparse features.To improve segmentation accuracy, we design a point-voxel constraint (PVC) module to handle edge voxels containing multiple point cloud categories, optimizing the final inference results. These modules add minimal memory and inference time but significantly improve performance compared to the baseline. Extensive experiments benchmarks on SemanticKITTI achieve excellent performance, while supplementary experiments on nuScenes also yield good results, demonstrating the superiority of MDC-Seg. The source code is available at https://github.com/OYgreat-river/MDC-Seg.

### [Illumination Adaptation for SAM to Achieve Accurate Segmentation of Images Taken in Low-Light Scenes]()

Achieving accurate segmentation in low-light scenes is challenging due to 1) severe domain shift encountered when models trained on daylight data are applied to such scenes and 2) lack of	large-scale fine-grained labels in low-light conditions. A good idea is to use the generalization capabilities of segmentation foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) to address the scarcity of annotated data. However, applying SAM to low-light scenes faces a severe domain shift issue due to the lack of inductive bias in effectively transforming low-light features into natural-light ones. To address this issue, we propose to adapt SAM for low-light scenes. To reduce the reliance on labels of low-light data, we develop a self-training method that makes SAM generate source-free predictions. To reduce the domain gap between low-light target data and SAM's natural-light trained data, we design a transformation head that enhances low-light features prior to the application of SAM. We further propose a domain shift compensation loss that trains our model to select a domain-adaptation-optimal illumination-enhanced feature map. Experimental results demonstrate that our method well outperforms the state of the art on the Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets.
